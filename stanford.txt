Staffing Recommendations?
Howdy, I've applied to staff a variety of dorms on campus, but I'm wondering if there are any tips from anyone who has staffed in the past about where is good and not good to staff. I am aware that some dorms have reputations for being better than others, and I feel like it's good to know that going in rather than being caught uninformed. Additionally, any advice for interviews would be greatly appreciated.

&#x200B;

Not worried about losing enthusiasm for staffing; I am genuinely excited to do so and am looking forward to it. 

&#x200B;

Thanks everyone :)

CS 106B v CS 107 during fall of freshman year
Hi everyone! I'm an incoming freshman interested in studying CS. I've already taken a data structures course in Java at my local community college, so I was wondering whether I should start with 106B or 107 in the fall. The course I took at my community college covers like 90% of what 106B goes over (everything minus C++ specific stuff), and I was able to understand it well (got an A+).

However, I've heard that 106B is a quintessential part of the Stanford CS experience, so I was wondering what would be the best move in terms of course selection. I am tentatively planning on doing a CS coterm as well, so maybe taking 106B would help with GPA? Or should I go with 107 if I'm fairly comfortable with 106B material?

Thanks!

Econ 102A Attendance Policy During Summer
The same professor who taught winter is going to teach summer, Scott McKeon, so I expect he'll use the same grading policy. How many lectures could I hypothetically miss before it affects my grade? \*I'm not actually planning on missing them, but I would like some reassurance that I can miss a few in case of my internship. 

The grading scheme: 

Toward Final Grade Assignments 25% 

Midterm Examination 30% 

Final Examination 45%

However, it also says in the syllabus: 

Regular class attendance is expected. If the instructor notices any student who attends less than half the class lectures, that student will almost assuredly have their final course grade lowered accordingly. Even when a student attends more than half the lectures, the instructor reserves the right to lower a student’s course grade in the event of multiple class absences.

urgent university decision help please:
I am currently contemplating between going to Stanford University this fall (costs $370,000 overall as an intl), or attending UNC Chapel Hill with a full ride merit scholarship (not the morehead scholarship, a diff one). As an international student aspiring to major in economics and enter the finance or economic policy world, would you say that the prestige level, networking, and opportunities of a university like Stanford would significantly help me compared to unc chapel hill? My parents are also very supportive of me attending Stanford as we can somewhat afford it (its 1/4th of our savings). BUT if I go to UNC they would give me $160,000 just to keep, which I could use for my masters, buy a house, travel, etc. Also if I went to Stanford and graduated with a high paying job, I'd have to pay my parents around 20K yearly. However, Stanford is Stanford and it's hard to say no to my dream university that has manageable rigor, great networking and resources, good weather, social life, etc. idk stanford feels like a once in a lifetime opportunity and i dont want to regret not going there when i had the oppotunity for the world's best univ. ngl i love prestige.   
 Which university do you think would benefit me the most? Do you feel like Stanford and its opportunities are worth the cost? I would really really appreciate the help. Thank you so much!!

Axess enrollment issue
Hello everyone,

As a summer session visitor, I activated my SU account yesterday and try to enroll in course by Axess. After the enrollment beginning time, I choose the enroll option in Axess, but the system shows that 'you do not have access to enrollment at this time'.

Could formal Stanford University students tell me, what's the issue?

MS in Symsys without computational experience
Hi guys, I'm interested in the MS Symbolic Systems at Stanford and am currently studying psychological and brain sciences. I have research experience that blends a lot of what the program entails (neuroscience, communication, statistics, cognitive psych, and philosophy) but I unfortunately can't take any computer science courses at my college because of how sought-after those classes are. Is it pretty much required to have a CS background to do symsys or is it something that I'll be able to develop if I get admitted into the program?

CSS profile questions for students on financial aid.
Hey everyone, I'm an independent undergrad who receives financial aid (scholarship + food and housing allowances). I'm currently filling out the CSS profile and was wondering if someone could provide insight on some questions (I've emailed fin aid, but sometimes they take a hot minute to respond).

In the CSS profile section "Student Expected Income and Benefits" we are asked to provide our expected earnings for the 2020-2021 academic year, as well as our expected taxed income and total untaxed income. Should I include any financial aid that I expect to receive for housing and food as part of my expected taxed income or untaxed income? (I ask because I paid state and federal taxes on the financial aid I received this year, but I know some consider it untaxed). Or do these fields only pertain to any income I may receive from internships and TA jobs, for example, and not financial aid? 

In the "Student Resources" Section we are also asked to include our expected earnings from "employers, (i.e. tuition benefits), including their parent's employers." Should I include financial aid as "tuition benefits" or is this something different? 

Thanks so much for the help...I'm relatively new to the CSS profile and Stanford fin aid so I don't wanna guess and mess something up.

Financial Aid Freak Out
I sent in my financial aid items (fafsa, css profile, parent W2s) only a few days ago. I'm currently a frosh. When I looked into my Axess and  went onto Manage my Financial Aid, it said my estimated family contribution would be 250% the cost of last year. Is this estimation already based on the financial aid info I sent in less than week ago? They didn't give me an official award letter, but this is causing me to freak out.

**Update:** I contacted the financial aid office and they said that they haven't actually reviewed the info I sent it, so the number on Axess seems to be just a place holder. 
--------------------------------------------------
What should I do the summer after senior year? (Incoming frosh)
hi guys! I’m conflicted as to how busy I should be this summer/how much I should focus on work. it’s my last real childhood summer with family and hs friends, and college summers will probably be used on internships and stuff. should I fill my schedule up with things like classes and internships, or should I take advantage of this last summer to be with my loved ones? What did you guys do? Will I regret it if I don’t spend this summer on academic pursuits? Would appreciate any and all advice!

H v S?
Hi, I'm an anxious fool who has annoyed my parents to death with my endless ruminations on choosing between harvard and stanford. I never got to visit either campus due to the pandemic and now I have to choose within the next 5 days lol. I know I probably sound like an idiot in this post, but I would really  appreciate any of your opinions.

About me:

\-introverted

\-dont mind cold weather

\-i like math (well, as far as i can tell having taken up through multivariable calc and 0 proof-based classes)

\-am interested in industry-minded CS  or industry-minded Stats, but then again i basically have 0 experience except some scripting in R for some data analysis during an internship w/ the IMF so ig i cant discern if im truly interested

\-is there a difference between CS or Stats recruiting btwn the schools? the vibe im getting is that there is a difference, where S is better for CS and H is better for Stats but idk

\-def won't party; prob won't drink

\-stanford costs 45k and harvard costs 50k so not huge diff, especially taking into account that i currently already live on east coast (DMV area)

\-not legacy at either school

\-not into sports

\-preprofessional clubs sound cool, idk if there is a any difference between what the two offer

Chan Zuckerberg Biohub is a joke.
I've been working in the same building as CZB for years now and have seen absolutely no evidence of actual researchoccurring.  They take up multiple labs worth  of  floor space  in the Lokey Stem Cell building, yet I've seen maybe one employee work there ( a middle-aged white guy who perpetually wears Stanford sweat pants). The "biohub" has rows of office space that are completely uninhabited as well as space in the animal facilities and, I assume, lab space. Is this a complete front for Facebook or am I missing something?

Deciding between Stanford and Brown
I'm having a lot of trouble deciding where I want to go (with only a couple of days left to make a decision...). Brown is one of my top schools whereas I applied to Stanford not really knowing much about the school. For context, I'm interested in the neuro/cog sci area (and also pretty interested in East Asian Studies, particularly Korea, which I hope to maybe minor in). I'm considering pre-med, but not entirely sure yet.

Brown pros:

* Has really good neuro/cog sci departments. Multiple people have told me the faculty is amazing.
* Open curriculum. I'm really looking to explore and not be held down by any requirements (besides the major requirements).
* Relaxed/chill environment. I was looking forward to this because I come from a pretty competitive high school so I wanted a change in environment.
* Grading scale has no pluses/minuses (which I thought would be better if I choose pre-med)

Brown cons:

* East Asian Studies at Brown seems to be pretty lackluster
* Unsure if the financial aid award I got will stay the same for all four years (I negotiated it to a lower price for freshman year so that it matched with Stanford's)

Stanford pros:

* I looked into some of the courses offered about Korea, and they all seem really interesting/taught by cool faculty
* I feel that Stanford is overall solid in everything they have to offer. All the courses I've looked into seem so interesting and the faculty also seem really amazing. (also I guess the Stanford name carries a lot of weight)
* My financial aid award was really good. I'm not sure if it will stay the same for all four years though.

Stanford cons:

* No neuro/cog sci major??? I thought that I could major in psych and do a neuro specialization, but it says here that the neuro specialization track is retired: [**https://exploredegrees.stanford.edu/schoolofhumanitiesandsciences/psychology/#bachelorstext**](https://exploredegrees.stanford.edu/schoolofhumanitiesandsciences/psychology/#bachelorstext)**.** I looked into the neurobiology track for bio majors as well but it seems too bio heavy.
* Duck syndrome. I've heard a lot about this, and I've also heard that Stanford has a huge startup culture. It also seems like a very CS school. I guess that could be nice because I was hoping to take some CS classes, but I'm not sure if the student environment is what I'm looking for (seems kind of intense?).
* A lot of general requirements. Do all the Ways requirements and such prevent flexibility in choosing courses? I was really hoping to take a lot of different classes and explore, but I'm worried that all these requirements will prevent me from doing that (plus if I choose pre-med, there would be even more requirements to fulfill).
* Grading has pluses/minuses

Honestly, most of the cons are really just questions that I have about Stanford that I haven't been able to find the answer to, so if anyone could help me out that would be amazing. Everyone's been telling me Stanford is the way to go, but no one's really given me a solid reason of WHY Stanford would be a better choice than Brown (besides CS, which doesn't really apply to me...).

Math 51 is eating me alive and I don’t know how to deal with it.
My dream job is to be an economist, and I am currently pursuing an econ major (Frosh). Math 51 is a prereq, and I am just drowning in this class. The psets are so hard and I just got an 11.5/20 on only quiz #3. I know a lot of kids are cheating or whatever, but I promised I wasn’t going to do that. I’ve never hoped to just get a C in a class before... U get the idea. 

Idk what to do. Advice is welcome.

Is a engineering (likely software) master’s worth it? Concerns while choosing between Stanford and Umich
I’m currently deciding between Stanford and Umich rn. Stanford gave me full tuition, Umich was close to full but I got a scholarship anyways for Umich that will cover all my tuition and fees for 4 years of undergrad and 3 additional academic years (they picked 3-4 kids from my Michigan high school to give full rides). I want to go to Stanford but I fear the cost of graduate school/Master’s degree will make me regret not taking Umich’s scholarship offer. As I ponder, I heard that most large companies would fund my master’s degree, is that accurate? Also, would the internship opportunities at Stanford offset the costs? What other opportunities could I pursue while doing my undergrad? These are all questions/concerns I have while I decide by May 1st, mainly sparked by a fear that I’m foolishly throwing away a sure thing with this Umich scholarship.

Mental health services at Stanford
'25 here! I don't have any psychological conditions (that I know of) but I can see myself going to the Stanford CAPS once in a while for therapy sessions (maybe once a month or biweekly) and I was wondering how available the staff is at the center? How easy it to make appointments? How caring are the staff there? How casual is it to just walk in and talk to someone (who doesn't have to be a therapist but can be) at the CAPS center? What other programs are there that are are robost and/or helpful! Anecdotes are also appreciated!

So I just recently committed to Stanford, and I’m wondering if there are any people on here that I can sorta maybe talk to. I’m kinda scared to talk on the discord servers and GroupMe is just a mess for me. 

I would love to meet some of you guys and talk about some random stuff, idk. I’m kinda awkward ngl so expect a lot of those moments...

programs for being on campus?
Hi, I'm an undergrad who was really hoping to be on campus in the summer but didn't realize you had to participate in a Stanford-funded program alongside using your flex units until the last email.

I had planned to be involved with volunteering and research on campus but unfortunately that doesn't qualify. :(

I’m happy that Stanford Wrestling got cut.
When Stanford initially alerted us about the 11 sports cut, I didn’t care much— I even felt a little sorry for the athletes. After seeing how the Wrestling team has reacted (https://twitter.com/RealUncleDev/status/1386923528704827392, https://twitter.com/neferchidi/status/1386778281194622976 (I know that other teams helped clean up after), and claiming they're “oppressed”), I am happy that the wrestling team has gotten cut. They are clearly very privileged and out of touch for reacting in such a way, and I don’t think this level of immaturity should be funded by Stanford. It is astonishing to me that they are so disrespectful to believe that their hardships compare to that of POC (they’re getting a world class education on a full ride...). I hope these boys find the will to shut up soon. And I hope Stanford does not reinstate their varsity status.

Stanford summer housing - early move in?
Hi, I will be moving to Stanford by the end of May and I have already applied for the on-campus summer graduate housing. I was wondering whether it is possible to schedule an early move in (like, soon after the housing assignment on 22nd May)? Asking because I'd like to have a backup ready since I can't delay my travel to the actual check-in date. 

Also, is it mandatory to quarantine oneself after moving in?

Going to SF for a night event?
I've already posted here about concerts but I can't find the post. Well basically I want to buy tickets for Machine Gun Kelly concert in SF but I am concerned about how to reach the venue. Public transport seem unfeasible (I have a disability and I'd have to check it out before deciding if I can take it alone). Also I don't feel safe taking it after the concert (at night). What are some other option I have? Are there cheap alternatives to uber/lyft? How much would that cost?

Feasibility of taking 2 different languages?
Hi! Prefrosh here! Please forgive the naïveté, but I was wondering how feasible it would be to learn two languages at Stanford. For me, I would define "learning" them as completing a 3 year sequence. So the way it would probably work out would be frosh and senior year having 1 language, and junior and sophomore year having 2. Of course the idea of that sounds cool, but I'm also wary that having 2 5 unit classes that meet every day would make it super difficult to get necessary courses done (for reference, my current interest is CS which (I  think) won't overlap at all). So, I'm wondering, has anyone done this? And if so, how difficult was it? Or is it clearly way too much? Does it depend on the languages? My current plan is to try one language course the first year, and then evaluate whether or not adding a second would be possible, but if that sounds like a bad idea I'd love to know!
--------------------------------------------------
No bike on campus ?
I know most students ride bikes around campus and depend on that to get to class on time, but I’m considering just walking. I think biking would stress me out. I’d have to spend quite a bit of money and re-learn how to ride one in the summer too. For those who just walk around campus, is it really as inconvenient as people say it is?

How can I prevent my dorm from hating me?
Hi there,

So I’m a current sophomore who’s on campus. My freshman year, I was the typical workaholic that never left his room to party or hang out with friends.

Now, once that I’ve been on campus, I’ve become known in my dorm for supplying all the alcohol in my dorm (white claws, cognac, Chilean wine, local craft IPAs, you name it). This has made me the most popular person within the complex (by far, if I may add!), leading to a significant lifestyle change for me compared to freshman year.

However, many of my dormmates assume that I have a fake ID, but it’s sadly not true. I have my 40 year old cousin go pick up the drinks on my behalf, and I go walk to the Galvez Parking Lot in order to pretend that I was out for a while. My cousin is moving next week to Austin, so my supplier will no longer exist.

How can I make sure that my dormmates won’t find out about this so I can avoid any potential embarrassment? Has anyone dealt with this situation before?

Prefrosh wondering wether to start with 106A or 106B
Hi! I'm a prefrosh for class of 2025. I have a pretty strong programming background in python (tons of projects, some CS internships) , but I was wondering whether to start with CS 106A or 106B. First, how do people with programming experience generally find 106A to be? Is it the type of thing where a decent amount of experience makes the course quite boring? Or generally do people who have experience still find it interesting?

Secondly, My programming experience is pretty non-standard, i.e. I've never taken an official class or have AP credit or anything like that. It's mostly been a bunch of projects and figuring things out as I go along. I'm pretty confident in my knowledge of programing, but I was wondering if missing out on a more structured curriculum would give me any problems, i.e. if I don't know the way things are generally formatted at Stanford, etc, would that cause a problem in 106B?

(quick edit on here, one thing I'd like to add is that since I've been programming for a while I'm pretty confident and google anything that might have been learned in 106a and figure it out as a refresher, but I'm wondering if having to do that while in 106B would make the course difficult)

Generally I like to err on the side of caution and I'm going to repeat a lot of HS classes I took, but this is the one thing where I consider myself to have a pretty strong background. I also am someone interested in tons of things and who will probably want to take more classes than I have space for, so I'd love to not have to take 106A and free up a course space.

And finally, advice on where to look/who to talk to about what experience would be necessary to start with 106B would be helpful!

Clubs/EC Life?
Hey all! I'm an incoming freshman '25 and we've been having the Spring Activities Fair going on this weekend, but there are soooo many clubs and orgs. Does anyone have a list/recommendations of the most popular / largest clubs and orgs on campus, and what they do? I'd appreciate any insights!!

How does the lottery system work?
I understand how priorities work, I’m just not sure how exactly they go about filling slots. I’ve seen people mention their “lottery number.” Does that mean they go down the list and assign people to their number 1 choice if it’s available, and then repeat that process for every choice for the people that didn’t get their choice the previous round? Or do they go down the list and go through each person’s choices until they hit on an open one?

If there’s a link to explain this that I missed while looking it up feel free to post it.

Anyone's experiences at CCRMA?
I'm a pre-frosh (haven't committed yet, but leaning to Stanford) and I'm really interested in a Music minor (with focus on Music, Technology and Society). I was looking at CCRMA's website and they seem to have a lot of courses that combine music and science that I find really intriguing.

The only thing is that I noticed that quite a number of those courses aren't on the catalogue anymore (or haven't been for the past 1-3 years). Is the department getting defunded or are those courses not being prioritized bc of covid? 

I'd also really appreciate if anyone could share any experiences they have with the department/its courses.

Thank you!

Is CS106A synchronous?
Thinking about taking CS106A during my summer flex term - Axess lists it as remote synchronous. Is this true? Also, is it dumb to take it in the summer?

Gift for incoming freshman
Hi all! I have a cousin that will be an incoming freshman this fall. Any recommendations for gifts for an incoming freshman? Something that would be useful or make his freshman year easier. Thank you for any input!

Potential First-Year Fall Quarter Schedule
Hi y'all! I'm an incoming First-Year who's hoping to study Math/CS, and I was looking to get some opinions on a potential fall quarter schedule. I've been told that it's a good idea to take it easy your first quarter, and I wanted to know if this potential schedule was too much.

1. CS 106B (5 Units)
2. ECON 1 (5 Units) / MATH 51 (5 Units)
3. ESF (7 Units) / COLLEGE (4 Units) / PWR 1 (4 Units)
4. Maybe a 1-Unit class in Vocal Performance?

While I was hoping to try for 15 units my fall quarter, ideally, I'd get an ESF seminar, which would put me over this --  I've heard that the workload for ESF, however, is less than 7 Units. If I don't get ESF, however, I'd probably replace it with the new COLLEGE requirement or PWR 1. I've also seen most of the CS 106B curriculum in prior courses, so I'm hoping that it won't be too bad for an introductory CS class -- but I'm imagining that it'll still be quite difficult.

As far as the ECON 1/MATH 51 goes, I've always wanted to explore economics and saw that ECON 1 was on the "frosh friendly course" list, so I though it would be a good addition. I might want to take MATH 51 instead, but apparently it's better to take it in the Winter? Any advice as far as this schedule goes, or for planning a class schedule in general? Thanks so much!

&#x200B;

Edit: Wow, thank you all for the responses! Definitely thinking ECON 1 over MATH 51 for the slot now. Any advice on the ESF/COLLEGE/PWR selection?

Summer housing available
I’m changing jobs and looking to sublet my place in Mountain View from May to the end of the lease in mid August. 

It’s a studio with an assigned covered parking spot right across the driveway. Bike-able to downtown Mountain View (or a leisurely 2mi walk). 

Perfect for someone who needs to stick around the Bay for the summer. 

Very flexible on price and start date. DM for more.

Is it possible to change to an engineering major after freshman year?
Hi there, 

I am thinking about switching to an engineering major (ME or Aero/Astro) after my freshman year after primarily taking Math and CS courses this past year. I am confident that i will be able to comfortably meet all the graduation reqs before I graduate however, my question is more focused on is it possible to eventually successfully land opportunities (internships, research, etc.) after not doing much freshman year directly connected to that field of study (in terms of classes, clubs, summer opportunity, etc.) and be in a position to have a good post-grad opportunity. 

Thanks!

Flex Class
Should I take CS110, CS 103, or Physics 43 in the summer? Obviously I want to get the hardest class out of the way with 110 so I could focus on it more but I’m afraid an in-person version of 103 and 43 are way harder than remote. Any advice? I’m not doing much else this summer besides research. Also I’d like to get as much done as the core as possible.

What major do I do to get into this field?
--------------------------------------------------
CS 103
Hello people!

I am a freshman in CS 103 right now and am greatly struggling--struggling because the content is very difficult for me and the amount of work given. I did well in my previous CS classes (non-theory, systems core classes), but really am just not having a fun time in 103 and therefore my grades on psets have been less than preferable so far. 

I know I needed to get the course done anyway since I want to major in CS so I didn't drop the class in hopes that I'd be able to rebound. 

I find the workload insane and kind of ridiculous--FOUR midterms means no weekend breaks half the quarter and PSETs 10+ pages long EVERY week including midterm weeks. I understand the grading system during Covid seems a little more relaxed than maybe it might have been in person but boy am I still struggling. I find myself not really interested in the topics as opposed to 106B and 'programming' classes. I am also particularly just struggling with proofs in general and this is my first time doing them. 

Any advice or words of wisdom anyone has for me? I want to pursue a career in CS (either industry or research in software and/or AI) and feel that not doing well here might hurt me. How true would this be in the long run? Would I have the benefit of the doubt given that I am a frosh, we are in a pandemic, and that anything I plan to apply to in the future will most certainly not be related to theory or discrete mathematics? Would a pass/fail for a core class be bad? 

I also don't have a partner so I am basically at a pretty big disadvantage somewhat. 

Thanks in advance!

how easy would it be to pay off about $100K of debt as an engineering major?

Stanford on the east
I’m currently a high school senior that’s undecided between Stanford and MIT. As a hopeful CS major, I know that the academics are equivalent at both schools. After graduating college, I would like to return back to the east coast — preferable somewhere in the southeast as that’s where my family is. I’m wondering how useful a CS Stanford degree would be on the east coast/southeast coast in comparison to let’s say an MIT degree. I know this probably varies per person. I would like to know how the connections and possible job opportunities would look for a Stanford CS grad would look — and if it’s rare for students to do this. Would you say MIT has the lead in this case?

I’m deciding between both and I feel like this is probably one of my bigger worries. Thank you!

What are some online courses similar to Stanford's CS106A course? Maybe Harvard CS50?
I'm a pre-frosh, and I wanna go into CS106B in the autumn quarter, so I'm trying to complete 106A beforehand. However, I don't think it's possible to take 106A, so I'm trying to find a course that similar to it and would prepare for me CS106B. Do you guys have an suggestions? Are there better resources than CS50?

Graduate Housing During Summer
Incoming PhD student, taking a look particularly at EVGR, Kennedy and the EV Studios. I'm wondering to what extent the central ventilation system in EVGR should be a factor. I know it's not real AC, but there seems to be some conflicting information about whether it does much to dull temperature extremes, e.g. the two relevant answers here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/lzfsxh/how\_are\_the\_on\_campus\_apartments\_that\_dont\_have\_ac/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/lzfsxh/how_are_the_on_campus_apartments_that_dont_have_ac/)

Can anyone give more insight into how bearable the various graduate housing options are are during the hotter parts of the year?

Stanford requiring COVID vaccination for all students in the fall (w religious & medical exceptions)
Dear Stanford community,

As we look ahead to fall quarter, I am writing to share an update on the crucial role that COVID-19 vaccines will play. As a reminder, we are planning to welcome all undergraduate class years to campus, including many who will be in residence for the first time in college. Our student housing involves congregate living. And we are looking forward to resuming the social activities and cultural and sporting events where we gathered before the pandemic.

Stanford’s COVID-19 Vaccine Governance Committee has been reviewing conditions and developments around vaccination against the virus, including an increase in supplies of vaccine and greater availability of appointments. Public health officials at the county, state and national level encourage all of us to be vaccinated. As CDC Director Rochelle Walensky has stated, “We continue to encourage every American to get vaccinated as soon as it’s their turn, so we can begin to safely take steps back to our everyday lives. Vaccines can help us return to the things we love about life, so we encourage every American to get vaccinated as soon as they have the opportunity.”

Based on these recommendations from the CDC and from our Vaccine Governance Committee, Stanford plans to require all undergraduate, graduate and professional students coming to campus this fall to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19. All students will be asked about their vaccine status prior to their arrival on campus for the fall quarter. We will work to help arriving students obtain a vaccination if they have been unable to obtain one at their home location.  

We will accommodate those who cannot take the vaccine for medical or religious reasons. Students in these situations will be able to request an exception and, once it is approved, will be required to undergo regular COVID-19 testing. Other requirements may also apply.

We know you will have questions about this policy and the details of how it will be implemented, and we will provide more details in the coming weeks.  

Stanford is also continuing to evaluate the vaccination situation for faculty and staff, and we expect to provide an update soon. But we want to share this information now with students and prospective students as they make their plans for the fall.

We believe this approach to student vaccination is necessary to support health and safety this fall. Vaccinations are a critical component in our efforts to mitigate risk and protect one another’s health within our student environment. We expect that other public health safeguards will also continue to be in place in the fall. These will be determined by public health rules and conditions at the time, but as one example, we expect that mask wearing, particularly indoors where others are present, will still be a part of campus life in the fall.

We encourage students to get a vaccine as soon as they are able. For students who are seeking vaccination now, please view this recent message about making an appointment, and consult healthalerts.stanford.edu/vaccinations for additional information.

Thank you for doing your part to help us renew – safely – the activity and vibrancy on the Farm that we have missed for the past year. And, as a reminder, the virus is still very much with us today, and highly transmissible variants pose an additional danger. We strongly encourage you to continue following the health protocols, including physical distancing and wearing of face coverings, that have enabled us to proceed with optimism and excitement for the fall quarter.

Sincerely,

Persis Drell
Provost

Instruments?
I’m an incoming freshmen and I was wondering if there is something in place in the Music Department for students to get instruments. I want to play in the Wind Symphony and/or Symphony Orchestra but I’m broke so I currently use a school owned instrument (for high school band). 

Will I have to buy my own instrument or is there a way I could continue playing music at Stanford without having to drop a bunch of money for an instrument?

Thanks

Driving around the Bay w/ a manual
I'm an incoming graduate student and drive a manual car in my hometown. I'm debating bringing my car or not to Stanford. I'm aware of the big hills in the SF area and definitely do not plan on driving my stick shift in San Francisco, but I was wondering about the area around Stanford and the San Jose area.  Are there a lot of big hills like in San Francisco around the Stanford area and south of Stanford? Will I end up in a sticky situation trying to drive around the Bay in a manual or is it like normal city/suburb roads? (for those who do not drive a manual going from a stop to go on a hill can be pretty difficult especially on an older car like mine)

EVGR/Mirielees Kitchens
Undergrad here, deciding my housing for next year. My roommate and I have decided our #1 priority is that we want access to a kitchen with a stove (we both love cooking and we really want to be able to cook for our friends and host small dinners etc). it seems EVGR would be our best bet for this, but they.... took out all the ovens? What are the odds the ovens come back after COVID/are our odds better if we got for mirielees/is this a pipe dream and I'm an idiot?

International Visiting Student Researcher fees
Hi everyone!

I have been lucky and I have been awared with a Fulbright grant for doing a research stay at Stanford. However, I have doubts about the fees that you need to pay as a Visiting Student Researcher, which in the website states that is a montly fee of $1,177 ([https://registrar.stanford.edu/students-tuition](https://registrar.stanford.edu/students-tuition)). I have talked with other colleagues that are going to Berkeley and other universities, and the fee is much cheaper (for instance 1500$ for their whole time there).

Am I missing something? It seems quite expensive. Have any of you had the experience of being an International Visiting Student Researcher? I would love some advice!

Thanks in advance!

trying to make real connections
 

**I came to stanford expecting to meet people who wanted to work really hard and really try to change things in the world and help people and i’ve been so disappointed. None of my friends have any real passion and it’s so disappointing. I’ve been trying to meet new people (joining clubs, socializing with my dorm, reaching out to people to grab lunch etc) but I can’t seem to find anyone who is super motivated to maximize their life. When I’ve taken classes with upperclassmen, I’ve definitely found this passion, but I haven’t found it in any frosh. And I’m not sure how to become friends with upperclassmen in my classes especially over zoom. Does anyone have advice on where to find these friends? I know they exist, I just don’t know where to find passionate people to be friends with. And I’m not trying to say I’m better than any of my friends or the people I know - it’s just that I want my time with friends to be studying and talking about our careers and futures and the purpose of life, not getting fucked up or gossiping like so many of the frosh I know. I just genuinely want advice or suggestions, because I feel like I was hanging out with the wrong people this year and I don’t want to spend all of my time at stanford like that. thank you <3**

Can someone give this non-traditional undergrad the rundown on ResX?
Hello, I am a new non-traditional undergrad who is guaranteed a spot in grad housing each year. Thus, I have been completely ignoring all ResX related emails as I thought they were just system generated and did not apply to me. I recently learned that undergrads who live in grad housing will still need to apply for a neighborhood just so we can stay in the loop on certain undergrad events. Can anyone give me the rundown on ResX and recommend a neighborhood that would be good for someone in my situation...does it even matter? I looked on the website and each neighborhood description is just a list of various undergrad housing options and the associated classes, but not much else. Thank you!

Warehouse/storage space for clubs?
Hi! Incoming '25 so I don't know anything about locations in California that might be ideal for this, but I am hoping to bring a nonprofit to Stanford, and I'm not sure how to go about securing a storage space. 

Basically, we need to make and distribute hygiene kits, so I need a place that can accept freight deliveries, and potentially an adjacent area (like a small café area or conference room) where about 10 people (at least) can make kits. 

Please let me know if you have any suggestions!! The org is called [SustainABLE Start](https://sustainablestartny.org) if anyone is interested in joining/leading the new SF chapter :)

Working Part-Time and Summer Classes?
Would it be more feasible to work 15 hours at a non-profit organization while taking 12 units of summer classes (ArtHist, POLISCI, and SYMSYS 1) or would 10 hours working at the organization be better? My concern is that if I work only 10 hours at the non-profit org, I may not get the full experience of seeing what the organization is like.

ResX + STEAM Panel
Hey Everyone!

Stanford STEAM are partnering with ResX to host a panel tomorrow (Thursday) at 3PM PT to answer any questions you may have about the neighborhood selection process! The panel will also have a few upperclassmen so that on top of the logistical information that ResX provides, you'll be able to hear the first-hand student experiences associated with each dorm. 

The zoom link: [https://stanford.zoom.us/j/95552103833?pwd=VnNmVXNDZnpMKzJZbll1Mi9VeEhLUT09](https://stanford.zoom.us/j/95552103833?pwd=VnNmVXNDZnpMKzJZbll1Mi9VeEhLUT09)

This we'll be especially informative for underclassmen who haven't had much experience with Stanford housing and those who are interested in finding the neighborhood that's best for them! 

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Torn between Stanford and USC
hey everyone! I’m an admitted student still deciding between here and USC. I want to major in mech e and minor in film, and at usc I have a full tuition scholarship as well as a few other perks in the engineering school such as a research job and stipend. I’m wondering if going to Stanford will allow me to find research experience, networking opportunities, and a better overall education in engineering that would pay off and make up for the difference in cost between there and usc. 

Additionally, if anybody knows, how is Stanford’s film? I’ve been looking at the classes offered but usc is much stronger in film of course. But I believe that finding an internship through stanford at a production company (Disney, Lucasfilms, etc have jobs in the Bay Area) may be more valuable than a film minor at usc. My dream job is to be a film engineer (VFX, motion capture, VR, animatronics, set design), so the engineering bit is more important than the film bit. thank you guys!

Advice for a timid incoming frosh?
Hi, so I got admitted into the class of 2025 and I’m an international student from a country in Southeast Asia. We’re a more reserved society and the prospects of being in the outgoing American setting kind of freaks me out. Are there any tips for surviving Stanford as someone who is inherently shy? How to approach professors, make new friends etc. Thanks so much in advance!

Anyone on campus good with car detailing and looking for some extra money?

stanford full pay or unc chapel hill full ride? please hear me out & help :)
This choice is driving me crazy so I'd really appreciate some advice

Intended major: Economics/finance/business (I hope to go into management consulting in the future).

**Stanford**

Stanford Pros

* will be surrounded by the smartest peers who will inspire me and we could collaborate on projects
* incredibly diverse
* research and connections with the most esteemed professors, many of which are nobel laureates
* very strong alumni base (including CEOs, startup founders, etc) who would help me get internships and jobs
* silicon valley and san francisco= lots of opportunities and all the large firms are there
* prestige and brand name will stick with me for a lifetime, no matter where I go.
* networking and the connections I'll make with some of the best minds in the world
* getting into the finance world is significantly easier from Stanford than from UNC. Being a target school and having relatively easy access to professors in finance fields, networking and opportunities are more accessible here.
* recruiting is insane-- all of the top consulting firms come to campus and clubs (like women in business) will have connections as well.
* it would be easier for me to get a great job with a high starting salary (100K ish) as econ/business is not as common at Stanford so the resources are abundant but students in this field are few (unlike UNC Chapel Hill where business= 2nd most common major and kids would be competing for more limited resources and jobs)
* very helpful and supportive student body, not that competitive (kids in the '25 group chat are already sharing resources and talking about collaborating on projects).
* Dream school for so long, it's hard to say no to the best uni in the world.
* feels like a once in a lifetime experience that is not only enriching and stimulating but also inspiring and it pushes me to be better.
* I'm an international student but I have uncles and family in San Fran which helps. The uncle works at a top firm so he could help with internships and stuff too.

Stanford Cons

* It costs $340,000 total. Even though my parents are supportive and they can afford it (no loans are needed) its still a significant chunk of money and I'd say its about 1/4 of our savings. i also have a younger sister who is in 10th grade atm. but if my parents still have the same job that they have now and have had for years, it shouldn't be a huge problem.
* Imposter syndrome, small fish big pond... Ig i'm worried that I may become depressed if I fall behind in classes and I feel like everyone is smarter than me and I'll be scared of failing cuz i'm spending sm of my parents' money as well. but ig it's up to me to stay motivated and seek help when i need it
* dating culture is quite lacking and honestly i'm really looking forward to finding a cute and smart brown boy in college :') BUTTT i could still find someone at stanford and we could be a successful and ambitious couple lmaooo idek
* I \*might\* have to do RA/TA to earn some money but my parents said it's not necessary

**UNC Chapel Hill**

UNC Pros:

* full ride merit scholarship (not the morehead scholarship, a diff full ride)
* amazing social life and school spirit
* I could save money and work hard and perhaps get into a top MBA program in the future
* still pretty diverse
* if i went to uni for free i would personally feel more ok pursuing my passions even if it didn't pay well. like maybe i would try for a consulting job in the United Nations or something with business + social justice. But if i'm already spending so much on my undergrad at Stanford I would be running after money right after I graduate and I may stick myself in a job (like investment banking) that i don't necessarily enjoy.
* better dating scene, although its 60% girls so the ratio is off and I feel like the girls there are too good looking compared to me HAHAHA. BUT if i go here on a full ride i could spend a lot of money on clothes and stuff and become a 'baddie' LMAO idek
* alumni network is still pretty strong, maybe a little less than stanford

UNC Cons:

* recruiting does happen (top firms do come) but i would say less than Stanford cuz at UNC Chapel Hill, business= 2nd most common major, and kids would be competing for more limited resources and jobs)
* there may be grade deflation and finance jobs rlly care about GPA so I'd say in terms of academic rigor stanford and unc are probs similar
* it's a bit more of a party school and i wouldn't find the same stimulating environment
* 82% are from north carolina

Visa Questions
Hello,

Recent admit here. Can't seem to understand how I can request an I-20. I went to Bechtel and applied for a record but it then started asking some SEVIS related 'optional' information which I had no idea about. Some questions I had regarding the process were:

&#x200B;

1. Does Stanford send some email after which we start the process or we cant start right away.
2. Do we pay the SEVIS fee before requesting an I-20. If yes, where do I do that.
3. And is SEVIS/I-20 the first step towards the Visa process?

I am very new to this entire process, so was wondering if anyone whose been through the procedure can just advise me on how to get started?

Thanks :)

In Person Commencement Announced for Class of 2021

--------------------------------------------------
University announces commencement is happening in June, reverting their decision to be fully remote.

Dear Stanford community,

I’m writing to share positive news about Commencement 2021: We will be able to offer the opportunity to celebrate together in person in Stanford Stadium. 

Due to ongoing public health considerations, the celebration will have to look different than usual. But improvements in the public health situation and the very recent relaxation of some of the State of California’s public health orders, including guidelines on socially distanced outdoor commencement ceremonies and out-of-state visitors, have now made it possible for us to move forward with plans for a limited in-person gathering this June. 

We are committed to a Commencement experience that, while imperfect in some respects, is fun, meaningful and safe, contingent on the public health orders in place at the time. We have consulted with student leaders, who have expressed their enthusiasm to proceed despite the constraints.

To comply with state guidelines and ensure necessary social distancing and health precautions, the following adjustments have been made:

We will have two ceremonies: one for advanced-degree recipients on Saturday, June 12 and one for graduating seniors on Sunday, June 13. 
Each graduating student who chooses to attend will be allowed two guest tickets.
To comply with state requirements, guests and students travelling from outside California will need to be fully vaccinated. Guests and students already on campus or travelling from within the state will need to be fully vaccinated or provide proof of a negative COVID test.
All seating will be socially distanced and pre-assigned, and face coverings will be required. 
Photo opportunities will be created to enable students and their families to capture their graduation moment. 
These events will also be livestreamed for those who are unable to join in person and a recording will be made available.
In consideration of the overall impact on campus, other events, including school and departmental gatherings, will still be virtual as originally planned. 

We are exploring ways to adjust other traditions. We will continue working with the leadership of the senior class and the ASSU, including the Graduate Student Council, to develop our plans, including COVID-appropriate alternatives to the Wacky Walk and other Commencement traditions. 

We will have more details in the coming weeks and will continue monitoring public health requirements to keep our graduates, their families and our community safe. In the interim, FAQs and other information can be found at Stanford Commencement.

We are well aware that this plan is not the full Commencement experience that we all would like to have. We deeply regret that some members of our community may not be able to join in person. However, after careful consideration of the situation and with health precautions and state regulations firmly in mind, we believe this is the best path forward and we are excited to celebrate with our graduates.

While these plans will provide an opportunity to gather for our 2021 graduates, most of whom will already be on campus, we are still operating with substantial constraints. Therefore, we will offer our promised in-person celebration for 2020 graduates at a later date and will be in touch with them when we have further information.

Our community continues to inspire me. While navigating the challenges and pressures over the past year, our graduates have been creative, determined and strong, simultaneously distanced yet together. I’m very much looking forward to celebrating – in Stanford Stadium – their achievements and marking the first steps of their new journeys!

We will continue to update the community as we look forward to a safe and joyous celebration amidst these unusual times.

how challenging/hard is ms&e at stanford
what's the curve like? how hard are the classes for someone focusing on the financial side of ms&e? i was thinking of majoring in econ with a coterm in ms&e although I am not the best at physics and calculus... how doable is this? (I'm a prefrosh).

Failed at startups
I’ve been feeling pretty burned out since all of the startup things I’ve been working on have pretty much failed. Does anyone have any thoughts on how to deal with this? I’m still interested in trying more things, I’m just wondering how to approach it all. Does it get easier once you graduate?

Housing for a senior next year
Hey everyone, 

I’m looking into hosing for next year with senior priority. If you could live anywhere where would it be and why? I’m looking for more places to consider. Right now I’m strongly considering Casper for a single or EVGR-A. I value privacy and quite but don’t know much about other options out there including the row. Any feedback or advice is greatly appreciated.

Seeking Advice/Reassurance
I hope you all are well and staying safe.

I was fortunate to be admitted to the MS Statistics program and I am very grateful. I am, however, in need of some insight to verify if I made the right decision in committing.

I am interested in pursuing research in machine learning professionally and seek to use the masters as a path to a PhD in CS or Stats (I realize that it's unlikely to end up at Stanford for both). I was, however, also admitted to MS programs (that include a thesis option) in CS at top departments (think UCSD, GATech, etc - but not Stanford, Cal, CMU, etc). 

Considering potential research opportunities, coursework focus, and networking opportunities to prepare me for a PhD  - did I make the right decision in committing to Stanford?

I would greatly appreciate any insight, thanks!

&#x200B;

P.S.

 I understand that this question comes from a place of great privilege and I do not mean to come off as ostentatious in any way. Also sorry for all the parentheses.

Help! Between Stanford Harvard and MIT

Hello!

I’ve been really lucky to have been accepted to these three schools, but I’m torn because they’re all great in their own way. I’m leaning towards going to Boston since Stanford seems to be in a very rich bubble. I’m low income and first gen so I’m a bit worried about that. 
I’m interested in either going into industry and working as a software developer or working with Google, or working with non-profits to develop devices for developing countries (I’m a bit undecided and all over the place). I love math and science, but I’m also interested in history and Latin American studies. So I’m either planning to do environmental engineering or comp sci with a minor in something to do with public policy.

Regarding MIT, I’m scared I won’t develop the soft skills I need in life in case I want to move up in the business world or in the world of non-profits. In addition, I’ve spent the majority of my high school just studying. 

I am a hard worker, some even say a workaholic, but I would like a more or less balanced college experience where I know I can find friends to have fun with, go into the city, shop, eat food, have silly conversations with. 

I’m extroverted compared to introverts but quite introverted around extroverts.
Besides that, I live in the south so I’m a bit afraid of the cold although looking for something new and exciting. 

I have visited Harvard and mit and love both their campuses but haven’t visited stanford. 
I am also not totally sure if I’ll go through with engineering.

Any thoughts?

I've been thinking nonstop if my admission was some sort of a mistake but upon finding out that Stanford is need-aware for international students, my thoughts became even more valid than ever before. I dont know, I've committed already it's just that what if they rescind my application later and tell me I'm just a mistake when I have already declined all my other schools huehue :<< Im just here to see if there are others as well who are intls (esp from third world countries, im from there btw) needing full aid and got in.

Hello all, me and my SO (both phd students) are considering moving into the couples housing. We were debating between 1 bedroom vs. 1 bedroom off-campus vs. 2 bedroom.

2-room triples in lees and EVGR-A?
**update: they will be** ***2BR triples***  (2 desks in one and 2 beds in the other room wtf) and they are taking out the bigger evgr beds and replacing them with the normal twins...they really screwed the upperclassman 

Do they intend on putting two people in one room and one person in the other room? Or does someone sleep in the kitchen/living room?

Please tell me I am [reading this wrong](https://rde-stanford-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/housing_chart_vertical.pdf) because it would be unfortunate to live in an already janky-shaped Lees room stuffed with two beds, two desks, two chairs, and a third closet somewhere (if you get one at all).

If so, do I just choose whatever I like that fits my reqs? Any initial guidance would be appreciated.

Question about Taking Courses the Summer Before Freshman Year
I'm a pre-frosh at Stanford, and I had a quick question. Is it possible for me to take a Stanford course (specifically CS 106A) this summer before the autumn quarter starts? I saw the Stanford Summer Session High School Summer College but noticed that applications were paused, so I'm seeing if there are other options that I could possibly take.

If not, are there any ways that I could take CS 106A (or its equivalent) informally without credit and just for self-learning?

Anyone else had luck negotiating an aid package with Stanford? I got none here but got 25k per year in aid from Princeton and wanted to know if anyone has gotten Stanford to match aid from another university. Gonna submit an appeal on Monday but it'd be helpful to know if it's in vain.

BTW I'd need them to go from nothing to at least 20-25k per year to even consider attending, but I'm just asking for anyone else's experience with their aid office on matters of aid reconsideration.

Is it still possible for me to get finaid; or will I have to go to CC? Thanks!!!

Coterm Housing?
Recently admitted coterm (and current senior) that will be taking a 13th undergrad quarter in the fall here. I plan on drawing alone for housing and don't have med draw or anything.

Recently the grad housing draw opened up, and I submitted an application because all new coterms that are seniors received an email 'strongly encouraging' them to apply, saying there's no risk. They didn't really explain why there's no risk, so I'm guessing maybe the graduate draw results come out while the undergraduate draw is still open, and we'd be able to give up our grad housing and go for the undergrad draw instead if we're not happy with the grad draw? Can any coterms confirm this? 

I'm asking because I really want a single/studio since I'm scarred from rooming with friends lol, but I feel like the probability is pretty low in the graduate draw given I'm 'low priority' as a 1st year coterm. Because of my 13th quarter, I've been debating if I should just go for the undergrad draw where I'll probably be top priority because I'm a senior. Not sure if these are unbased assumptions given the switch up with ResX, so any advice is appreciated about the best way to go for a single or studio as a coterm, if it's even realistically achievable.

Need help with undergrad decision
Hi, so I am an admitted student for 2025 with what to me is a tough decision at hand. I have the choice between Stanford and University of South Florida. At USF, I would receive the Benacquisto Scholarship and based on how it sounds, I would end up taking home some money each semester (~3-5k). On the other hand, I can go to Stanford for about 20k a year so really I would end up with about 120k difference between the two (spend 60k of college savings and taking 30k of loans out at Stanford vs USF save my college fund and add 20-30k onto it). I would be able to graduate from USF in 3 years and could do the BS/MD program, but my problem is I am very unsure about whether or not I want to do medicine and Stanford would provide a stronger overall education and more opportunities compared to USF if I don’t do medicine. I’m really not sure what to do here because I know many people go in wanting to do med but end up switching and while I would like to believe I would follow through in medicine, I’m worried I won’t and that is making me shy away from USF.

Here is a pro-con list I made a while back for more context on my thought process..
Intended major: economics on a pre-med track  (but still unsure about pre-med)

USF Pros:

•	⁠Could do 7 year BSMD program and that reduces stress about getting into medical school •	⁠Not as demanding as Stanford, easier to get a higher GPA for med school
 •	Near Tampa, which is cool and there would be lots to do off campus 
•     Honors college 
•     Visited and liked the campus a lot, dorms seem pretty nice
•	Because of National Merit, would end up pocketing some money in undergrad, which allows me to save my current college savings

USF Cons:

•	Dependent on me going to med school, which I am unsure of
•	⁠Worried I may not fit in as much, not much of a party person
 •	Just not sure about Florida in general and whether or not I want to stay there for 7 yrs if I do BS/MD cause if I go there, I 100% plan on doing BS/MD
• With BS/MD program, would be more difficult to match into a competitive specialty like derm where only 1 student at Morsani matched a year or two ago

Stanford

Stanford Pros:

•       It’s Stanford, no matter what I do I am getting a good education
 •       More opportunities offered, connections
 •       May be easier to make friends
 •       Prestige of Stanford will slightly help with med school admissions, but nothing significant, also could have better chances at scholarships 
•        I love the West Coast and I could do more outdoorsy stuff there with the coast and mountains nearby. (although students rarely leave campus so may be overestimating)

Stanford Cons:

•	⁠Would need to take out about $30,000 in loans, putting me in worse financial condition if I do go to medical school.
 •	⁠Imposter and duck syndromes
•	Classes more demanding, less time for myself
•	⁠Quarter system
•     Dorms seem like they are kinda lacking

I mean I feel like I would be literally crazy to not go to Stanford based on what my peers say, but USF’s offer is also very difficult to pass up. Can anyone provide any advice on what they would do? Anyone else been in a similar situation? Anything else I should consider?

Thank you!

Anyone know anything about the Special Language Program?
Hi! Class of 2025 admit here! I was wondering if anyone had/could share their experience with the Special Language program. I'm interested in using it to take Urdu in future years (don't know when they'll be able to offer it because currently it seems they're not accepting new requests right now because of covid. Emailed the program director, she CC'ed someone else and that person hasn't gotten back to me yet but anyways....)

&#x200B;

I've been researching it a bunch but I haven't found any information on what it's actually like. Are the classes generally pretty small? Do they still meet the same amount as normal language courses? If there's only one person interested will they still do the class? Are the professors normal Stanford faculty? if anyone has any, any information at all on what the program is actually like would be appreciated!

Information for the Class of ‘25
Hey everyone! I hope all of you reading this have a great day. I was admitted Early Action for undergrad Class of ‘25, and I’m ecstatic.

However, I just wanted to ask when I should expect to begin receiving emails about housing, class enrollment, and basically all the important things that come with starting college. I know it’s still somewhat early, but I just wanted to have an idea beforehand. Thanks!

Where to live as a senior?
Hey — was wondering where graduates or current upperclassmen enjoyed living on campus. I will be a senior after taking a mid college gap year (so happy I could do that). Here’s where I have lived :

Roble (quad), Kimball (one room triple), Crothers (one room double). I have never had a single so that’s something I’m looking forward to, though I’ve had great roomies. Central or west campus would be ideal because there’s a lot of resources on that side BUT evgr-a looks so nice. BTW I have only gone inside a row house like 4 times. For those of you who live on the row, was it really worth it? What about suites?  Thanks in advance 👍

Also.. if you don’t have enough info to give recs, what sorts of questions do you ask yourself when choosing where to live? I always let my roomies choose and since this is my last year I want to be more intentional

Edit: I have a group of ppl who I am down to draw with but we have a consensus that if we all have really different preferences then we won’t. Still waiting to have that convo.

I've tried logging into eduroam using my SUNet ID and Stanford password, but can't connect. Are there other options or is this just my new fate?

Highlights of the Stanford graduate community?
Hey, /r/stanford! I'm a current undergraduate elsewhere crafting my Statement of Purpose for my graduate applications to Stanford. There are many faculty within the relevant department working on my highly specific interests, which is fantastic. I've also emphasized the way in which the highly interdisciplinary nature of the Stanford academic community serves my academic interests well (social sciences + stats/cs). Are there any other unique elements of Stanford, especially within and among the graduate departments, that I might take note of, not necessarily to explicitly state in my applications but to get a general sense of how to display personal fit?

How weird would it be to sleep on The Lawn?
Is this even allowed? Would I be told to get off? Would I upset anyone? Are there better places to have my siesta (other than my room)?

How (unbearably) far is The Lawn and the Memorial Church in general from other specific, good-to-know buildings (you name them), assuming I won't be having a bike with me? It might be relaxing to spend a little time in the Memorial Church everyday but it would suck if it takes too long to get there. (Don't know how to bike, rip) What are some alternative means of transport you'd suggest, and what would be the pros and cons?

What are other nice places to relax, maybe in solitude? Are there any lakes or streams in or near Stanford that one could go canoeing in? What are the best waterfronts to go walking on?

Storage until fall quarter?
Hey yall, 

I'm a grad student that was living in EV studios. 

I've recently had to move back home due to covid related, reasons, and I was planning on having my stuff(currently packed into 3 boxes) stored with collegeboxes. But I've been kinda sketched out recently with them. Is there any other service I can use to store my stuff? Or is collegeboxes still my best option? My apartment is still under my name, and I have a friend holding my key so whatever service can come pick it up, but I'm not sure what the best option is, since I haven't spent much time around palo alto.

CS in crisis?
Hi everyone! To preface--I'm a very excited potential tree, but I'm also a cross admit to Harvard and Yale, and I'm trying to decide where to commit (very nice problem to have!). 
I'm planning to major in CS, so I'd appreciate responses especially from CS majors (which let's be real is prolly most of you here).
I know that rankings wise Stanford wins because its program is awesome, but I'm worried by the sheer size of the computer science department.

Specifically, this article https://www.stanforddaily.com/2019/02/19/cs-in-crisis-is-stanford-doing-enough-to-respond-to-capacity-and-inclusion-challenges/

In your experience, do most computer science classes have little faculty interaction and hundreds of students? Do you routinely wait 2 hours to ask questions in office hours? Are upperclassmen undergraduate students the primary instructors that you interact with? Do most of the upper level classes also still have bloated enrollment?

I know I'm asking a biased group, but might teaching be better with the smaller class sizes at H or Y?

On job outcomes:
Stanford has SV, so jobs are easier to come by, but salary outcome-wise Harvard CS grads are on par with Stanford. This suggests to me that my chances of finding a job/internship are not dependent on which university I choose. Thus, I care more about the quality of instruction itself.

TL;DR *ignoring superficial rankings, will I get better, more personalized instruction with roughly equal job outcomes at Harvard? Or is Stanford still the better option for CS*?

Before today, I was basically ready to commit to tree-dom, but this article has me pretty spooked. Any advice appreciated! Have a great day!
--------------------------------------------------
Co-ops
Some of my friends and I are interested in drawing into a co-op next year, but we don't know many people who've lived in co-ops. What are the general vibes/characteristics for each one?
--------------------------------------------------
Is it just me or have you lost all passion, motivation, and direction after starting at Stanford?
Resubmitting as the last one seemed to have gotten deleted.

In high school, I was so motivated to work hard and cultivate good relationships with my teachers, mentors, etc. But now all of that has 180-ed, and I don't feel any drive to excel in anything, except maybe enough to get myself a job after graduation. For example, violin, which was one of the ECs I put a lot of time and heart into during HS and before, I now just don't give a shit and have been having a deteriorating relationship with my violin teacher (I just don't care so I forget to do certain things, or practice too little). Like just now, he asked me last week to practice 2 etudes, but I just ended up forgetting about it and never practiced them. What's even the point? I don't even really enjoy practicing or performing at all, it's just something I keep doing because A I'm partially afraid of losing the skill I have and regretting it and B my parents prod me to keep playing. I don't really like practicing, and basically force myself to practice up to 1 hour and immediately stop after the timer reaches it. It has become a chore, and I see no benefit or reason to improve, except to be able to perform for other people so that at least I have some skill or redeeming quality and making my parents happy. Other than that, I find no personal satisfaction from playing music: it's just playing the right notes in the right order, with some dynamics, I guess. My skill has gone downhill, and I practice less than ever. It makes me feel really bad because I'm in an awkward situation where I don't enjoy it at all, but I still feel obliged to do it, and yet I still let my teacher down over and over again.

In general, I feel like I just no longer have a singular goal like "get into college", but rather I've been dropped by a helicopter into the middle of a jungle and have no direction in life. Do I go to grad school? Do I just coast and take a SWE job after graduation? What should I do?!? I feel no responsibility to do anything, except the bare minimum that is required to be socially accepted and validated: do something on campus to be able to say that you are active, and have a "hobby" so that you're not bland. I find life thoroughly unexciting, and although I might project to other people that I may seem excited about what I'm doing on the outside---and actually others do think that I'm excited about things---, I really feel like "meh" about so much stuff that I do. Don't get me wrong, I guess I do find what I do interesting, but it's such a drag. And it's not even like I would otherwise be doing something I really like that is unproductive, like gaming: I just don't find pleasure in almost anything! Maybe it's also because I've gotten so pigeonholed into more theoretical subjects that don't relate to impacting or potentially impacting the lives of real people.

Do I have to find a new hobby to do? I've stopped genuinely trying new things for a while; maybe it's time. But again motivation is lacking. I guess I just need to find something I really want to do and enough free time to pursue that project, despite it being outside of my "interests".

Anyhow, I don't really know what to do. Since college started, the one word that can describe everything is "lost". And because I have no direction, I have no higher-level goals that are fueling the motivation for doing particular "interests", like violin (I did in high school, since it was basically required to get into a good college!). There is no measuring stick I can use to know "aha, I'm going in the right direction, I just need to do [this activity] a bit more and I'll be able to inch closer to my goal". I'm not sure if anyone can relate, but honestly I've become so lazy, and I see no reason to try harder, even though I know it is "good" to be a good student, researcher, etc. Does anyone have any advice for this sad junior?

Grad Students/New Grads looking for Roommates?
Hey everyone,

I'm a new grad from Notre Dame working at VMWare next year in the Palo Alto headquarters as a software engineer, which is just a few minutes from Stanford. Are any grad students (preferably women but open to others) looking for roommates next year? I'm pretty clean, like hiking and going out on the weekends, and definitely would love living with other people in tech but my current roommates are humanities people and we get along great as well. Feel free to dm me if interested, thanks!

Pipe organs at Stanford?
This is kind of trivial, but are there any organs at Stanford that students with experience in keyboard instruments can be granted access to? Maybe I just have poor search engine skills, but so far the only campus organs I've found are the ones (the five, ig) in the Memorial Church. Are these open to students or student ensembles upon request?

curious about SLE
incoming '25 considering SLE. prospective philosophy/linguistics major

i've looked at the sample syllabus and it seems like something I would be really interested in. [http://slesyllabus.pbworks.com/w/page/14417779/SLE%20Schedule%20Current%20Quarter](http://slesyllabus.pbworks.com/w/page/14417779/SLE%20Schedule%20Current%20Quarter)

still, i was wondering if anyone here could give me a better idea of what exactly SLE is? i vaguely know that it's a residential program which focuses on philosophy/humanities, but i'm not sure what that actually implies, for example, in regard to prereqs. 

is it more of an "extracurricular" commitment? or an academic program? where do you typically meet? is it hard to schedule around your SLE stuff? if you've done the program, did you feel like you were able to take the classes you wanted to, or did you have to make sacrifices because of SLE requirements? would you say that SLE classes are on the same level of quality as regular course offerings?

i'm really excited about this, but i want to be sure about what i'm getting into first. thank you so much in advance.

CEE 107A/207A/ EarthSys 103 Understanding Energy Course feedback and experience request
Hey guys. I wanted to listen to experiences from fellow students or alumni who took the Understanding Energy course by Dianna Gragg. While going through the course syllabus, the course really seems to be engaging and fun with its field trips and mandatory class participation. What are your experiences, if you had taken the course? Those who opted for the workshops, how exactly does 80min per week discussing a topic roll out and how do they gauge each student qualitatively and quantify the marks?

Stanford language learning club/community?
Hi! I’m a frosh who was admitted in the CO2025. I really want to join a language learning club/community at Stanford but I’m not sure if there’s any. 

I also really want to learn Portuguese so I’d love to join a Portuguese speaking club/community too! Thank you!! 🤗

Khan Academy/Other Study Material
Hi everyone!

I'm an aspiring pre-med who's hoping to get a quick crash course for some of the concepts I need to know for intro courses before I take them, mainly because I'm a really slow learner and I usually fall behind if I don't work ahead :)

Does anyone know what Khan Academy courses I should look at for Chem 31M, Bio 60-62, and Physics 20-26?

If Khan Academy's don't compare to Stanford's curriculum, does anyone else know good study tools? I'm also wondering if Stanford has syllabuses online?

Finally, I'm wondering how AP classes typically compare to Stanford's curriculum, and whether reviewing AP material will be a massive help.

Thank you!

Freshman anxious about only having 3 years left
Part vent, part wondering if any other freshmen feel like this, part interested in any upperclassmen's thoughts about this.

The idea of already being a sophomore next school year is intimidating to me. Quarantine has made me significantly more depressed, and I feel like I wasted a year that I could have spent exploring various academic fields, whether it would have been through taking a variety of classes or participating in clubs. I certainly have tried and took classes that are quite different and tried to attend some club meetings/events with guest speakers but I guess I still feel like my freshman has been "wasted" because often I've felt too depressed and isolated to really fully engage in my classwork and in discussion sections. I still find the subjects pretty interesting but my enjoyment was definitely a bit clouded by my depression and I could have gotten more out of my classes if my mental state was better. Most of my classes are in the subject that I'm thinking about majoring in (but I'm still a bit unsure about it), and getting myself to do the work has been so difficult. I know the Zoom format really contributes to me feeling so terrible about doing work but I'm also worried about how I'm banking on that to be the explanation when it could also be that this subject is not something for me.

I've heard that majors at Stanford are designed to be able to be completed in two years and I guess my sophomore year I still have one more year to explore some more and figure out if the subject is suitable for me, but I don't know, I'm still a bit bummed out about it. People always talk about how college are really formative years especially in helping you figure out your future plans but because of the circumstances this year I'm here nearing 19 and I still feel as lost and stupid as when I was 17, even 16 because I don't really remembering feeling that being 17 was that different from 16. 

I don't know. I'm just a really anxious person. I hope things will turn out okay. Thanks for reading.

Zapata vs Frosh Dorm?
Incoming freshman here! A little background: I'm Colombian but very out of touch with my roots (still learning spanish, not too familiar with cultural traditions, etc.). I definitely want to learn more about my heritage, and I've heard the community at Zapata is extremely welcoming! 

However, since COVID is kind of dampening everyone's college experience, I feel like all-frosh dorms would help me have more of the typical freshman experience (tons of friends, etc.). 

What are the pros and cons of each? I haven't been able to find much on reddit about Zapata so please lmk if there are threads I should look at. Also, should/could I live in an all-frosh dorm and then Zapata as a sophomore?

is it crazy to think about turning down stanford for barnard college?
edit: after more thought and research i'm going to commit to stanford! nyc will have to wait til after college 

throwaway so i don't get doxxed. i was lucky to have a pretty great app cycle this year (yay!)but struggling with my heart. cost-wise, both schools are the same luckily (but arguably stanford could provide better value for my money?)

i do really like stanford and it's definitely a better school for someone as unsure as me, because every major and program at stanford is world-class so i have the freedom to explore. the sheer amount of resources and opportunities provided by stanford would probably be way better at enabling me to pursue what i want. stanford's campus culture is pretty meh to me though. i don't want to go to college to make a startup or work at FAANG, and i hate the duck syndrome thing. i don't want to feel out of place as a humanities student. however, i do love the actual campus itself, and the traditional college spirit because of stanford's amazing sports teams :)

on the other hand, barnard is a humanities-centered womens LAC, so if i want to major in STEM i don't know how good it would be (or if i'd have to fight to use columbia resources). but the culture at barnard seems so well-suited to me and absolutely incredible! i'm so sure that intellectual, community vibe is much more my thing than stanford's startup. individualistic culture. and location wise, my heart just can't stop wanting to go to nyc. i like stanford's traditional college experience, but i also like the whole idea of the city being my campus! (no offense, but palo alto vs nyc is no contest). most importantly, i'm from the bay area, so stanford isn't anything new! i'm scared that if i go here i'll feel stunted and won't ever leave, even though i desperately want to.

basically, i'm in two minds. there are serious pros and cons to both schools. i know asking this on the stanford sub will give me biased answers, but not sure where else to ask (barnard doesn't seem to have a sub).

Does Stanford have a BA in CS?
Class of 2025 admit here! I was wondering if stanford had a BA program for CS, not just BS; Or, if they don't, can one still take a reasonable amount of other classes with the BS?

Summer Quarter
Has anyone heard anything about when Stanford will allow people to apply for summer Quarter housing?

Additionally, what dates does summer Quarter accommodate? I'm doing research over the summer which begins right after Spring Q finishes, but i know summer Quarter classes don't begin until 6/21.

Serious question
So I got accepted into Stanford and I wanted to ask if I’m allowed to jerk off in the dorm showers or do I need to do it in my dorm, but then my roommate will be there 😏
--------------------------------------------------
Quick Questions about Stanford from '25 admit
Hi y'all!! I'm so excited I got into Stanford, but I'm deciding between it and another school so I'm trying to learn more! I know a lot of these questions are about negative things, but that's only because there are a lot of things about Stanford that I already love. I'm just trying to learn more about the potential downsides that I've heard people talk about:

* Would you say there's a pre-professional culture at Stanford (in the sense that everyone already knows what they want to do and everyone's always talking about career goals and internships and stuff like that)?
* Is the techy-fuzzy divide real? If so, how does it manifest itself and to what extent? Is it overwhelming to be around so many CS majors, especially if you're not into tech. Anyone can answer, but I'd prefer answers from a humanites or social science major.
* Would you say students are academically curious outside of their immediate discipline? Are CS majors still excited about English classes and are Art majors still interested in learning about physics? I know everyone's apparently super passionate about one thing, but are they still excited about other things?
* How true is the "everyone is nice" thing people always say about stanford?
* What's the social scene like? Not just freshman year but also after that? How, if at all, do people engage with SF and Palo Alto?
* If you're black, how is the community there? How welcoming and accessible are the spaces for black students? How often, if at all, do you feel discriminated against or somehow excluded because of your race?
* Why did you choose Stanford, ig?
* What do you wish you knew before coming?

A little about me: I don't have a major yet but it really could be anything from physics to international relations to sustainability. Very undecided on that front. I applied to Stanford mostly because I'd heard so much about how the community is very happy and collaborative and the resources and academics are really good and the campus is super pretty. I've heard it's a place where people are really passionate about whatever they do and many people are passionate about helping the world and people which is exactly the kind of place I wanna be. I also liked that it's a school that's very different from the environment I grew up. I don't live on the east coast but many of the people at my school go there so if I go to Stanford I'd kind of be forced to experience something really knew and exciting with the opportunity to sort of start over. But because of that, no one in my life is super familiar with stanford other than "it's a really good school that's said to be really happy and have great weather," so my knowledge of the school is somewhat limited. Most of the questions above are based on rumors my peers have heard and things I've seen online.

Hope to hear from some of y'all! Wuv u :)

How do I not get my acceptance rescinded (in terms of grades)
Hi!! I recently committed to Stanford as part of the class of 2025 and that has intensified my senioritis but also made me anxious about getting rescinded so I was just wondering what the standards are grade-wise to not get rescinded? I’m an A or A- student for reference but might end up with a B or two this semester. Maybe more...who knows...I personally am fine with getting Bs but idk what Stanford thinks about that. What do you all think? Thanks!

Asking again: Stanford Anime Club?
I know a couple weeks ago, someone posted interest about an anime club and even set up a discord. I was hesitant at first, but now I realized that this was something that really interested me. However, that link expired but i would really love to link up with fellow trees of culture. Can anyone help out/ refer me? Thanks!

CS PhD Happiness
Hi, I am a prospective CS PhD student, and Stanford is one of my top options. After hearing stories of unhappy students with 12-16 hour work days with immense stress, I am wondering if that is generally the norm or if most students are able to find some kind of balance.

Machine learning sequence
Hi everyone,

I am a math major at Stanford who is very interested in learning about machine learning methods. Currently, I have one free spot open for each quarter next year and I want to use it to take a "one year sequence" in machine learning. Unfortunately I don't know anything about Python but I am skilled in C and R. I am also well versed in mathematical proof and concepts. 

I am wondering if any of you can recommend some cool machine learning classes (hopefully can be one for each quarter)? I reached out to the relevant people but have not heard back.

Thank you!

What’s the culture like at Stanford?
Hello students and not-students of reddit!

I’m a prospective student currently narrowing down my college list and I want to get insight into what colleges are like aside from what the college itself is putting out

So for current or graduated students how would you define the atmosphere?

Also what would you say pros and cons are of the school, what is the social life like, student body culture, academic culture, how’s the food, dorms, teachers, etc

Also I’d be applying for aerospace so I’ll take any information regarding that! 

Even if you don’t respond but just choose to read this thank you very much

I’ll take any information you have!

Question about Getting Credits Before Declaring Major
So I'm a pre-frosh at Stanford, and I know that students have to declare a major before their junior year. However, since I'm not really sure how credits/courses work, I'm a bit confused.

1. Does this system mean that all the classes I take before junior year are general/core education classes, and only the classes I take after declaring my major are specifically for my major? 
2. Are all the classes I take in freshman and sophomore the same for all majors (or at least all STEM majors)?
3. If I decide that I don't want to do a specific major right before junior year and want to pursue a different path, will I need to take classes that I would've missed in my first two years?

Sorry if these questions seem intuitive, I'm new to the college scene.

Financial Aid Match/Appeal
Does anyone have experience getting Stanford to match another school's financial aid package? I have a school (T5) offering me much better aid than Stanford, but I saw someone say I'll have to submit a full-on appeal (Request for Revision) because Stanford doesn't directly match other offers.

Does someone with experience appealing/matching Stanford aid mind describing what their experience was like? 

Thanks a bunch in advance. I'd like to attend, but it's just not feasible if I'm unable to get more aid :/

Study Abroad Questions
Hi! Bit of a change from the crazy influx of Res-X posts, but I was wondering if anyone here could weigh in with their experiences with the Stanford Study Abroad program. I'm a rising junior and I'm interested in possibly taking next spring to study abroad in Oxford. I have a few questions regarding the program: 

(1) Does financial aid cover study abroad; would I have to pay more at Oxford? 

(2) What exactly is a tutorial and how does it work? 

(3) Would I only be allowed to take SCPD courses and the courses offered in the BOSP Course Search, or would I also be able to enroll in Oxford courses as well? (For example, I'm a math major and would like to take Math 155: Analytic Number Theory or Math 172: Lebesgue Integration and Fourier Analysis next year; would I be able to take an equivalent at Oxford?) 

Also, general replies sharing your experience with the program (either at Oxford or any other campus) would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

Freshman housing for certain neighborhoods
I'm slightly confused as to how freshmen assigned to neighborhoods such as [N](https://rde.stanford.edu/studenthousing/stanford-neighborhood-n) will be housed. By my understanding, all of the dorms listed are for upperclassmen. And why does [Neighborhood A](https://rde.stanford.edu/studenthousing/stanford-neighborhood-a) have the entirety of Stern Hall (which I heard is frosh-only)? Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------
Stereotypes about different frosh dorms?
What are the different ones like? This is what I’ve gathered thus far:

Wilbur: lots of parties, very social

Stern: also lots of parties, lots of dancers too, apparently has a huge breakdancing scene

Flomo: almost entirely mormon, extremely strict

FroSoCo: big deodorant scene
--------------------------------------------------
MS&E Major
Hi,

Incoming freshman here! I'm deciding whether or not I should take the MS&E major – the basis of the major itself is really attractive to me, but I've heard rumors that MS&E for undergrad isn't that great. Any ideas on what I should do? Are there any alternatives? Thanks!

Thoughts on being an RA in a frosh dorm
I'm debating whether I would try to apply for staffing next year. I had a lot of fun my freshman year but it seems like the experience can vary depending on the people you are with. Would love to hear some thoughts from people who have been an RA or are thinking about it. How does the time commitment look like? Is it a good way to meet new people/involved in the community (compare to living in a co-op or theme house)?

STS & AP credits
Hello!

I’m a recent admit and I’m hoping to major in STS. I was wondering which AP tests I should take this year (that would help me with my major.) I’ve looked all over the internet but I can’t find any definite breakdown or anything. I’ve already taken APUSH, Lang, and phys1. I’m currently signed up for phys2, calc BC, Lit, gov, macro econ, and Spanish. Which of these would give me credit?

Thank you!!

ResX Advice (Random vs. Group, Neighborhood, etc)
I know there has been a lot of similar questions recently but can upperclassmen (or other frosh) please help a confused and super anxious frosh out? Any advice or info would be great!!

As an international remote frosh I haven’t made any close friends and I don’t feel comfortable enough to ask anyone whether I can join their group or if they’re willing to draw with me... should I just apply alone? 

At the same time I feel like those who applied with friends will stick to those friends and I’ll still be left out :( I also don’t want to feel like the only one who doesn’t have a friend group or any friends by the time sophomore year comes around. 

But given I don’t know anyone maybe location and dorm quality is more important and I should just apply alone and choose the neighborhoods I like more. Which neighborhoods have better dorms? Which dorms are closer to most classes? Best dining halls? I know nothing about campus LOL. 

Ok, I’m done for now. Thanks for listening to this rant.
--------------------------------------------------
Consulting without calc 🤔
Frosh here. I’ve recently gotten into the idea of consulting as a career option (at least for the period after college) I’m interested in education, polisci, urban studies, and IR, and have only taken math 19 and Econ 1. Is a career in consulting still an option if I really just don’t want to continue taking stressful math and Econ classes (I’m really terrible at math, but okay at algebra and arithmetic). I’ve noticed many Econ classes have math 51 as a prerequisite. Do consulting firms typically look into classes people have taken and prefer candidates with math and Econ?

Did anyone chose Stanford over a BSMD program?

On-campus jobs. How much can you make from an on-campus job as a freshman? Are they easy to get?
Hey! This fall I’ll be joining Stanford as part of the class of 25. Getting some extra funding to support my college experience is really important for my family. I was wondering what was your guys’ experience with on-campus jobs. Are they easy to get? On average how much money can you make? What are some of the best on-campus jobs? Any insight would be really helpful.

Advice to get into research as an undergrad
Hi everyone, I'll be joining Stanford as a member of the class of '25 after taking a gap year. One of the things I am most looking forward to at Stanford is getting involved in research.

 I was just wondering if someone experienced has some advice about how to contact professors to get into research. I'm mostly interested in math so I want to consider doing research in an applied math field, MS&E and maybe even CS.
I looked at some projects available online and most of them require some advanced coursework, so I wanted to know about research done in freshman year specifically too.

I have done research in high school but it was mostly done at the individual level so I can be considered inexperienced for the most part. Is this going to be a big hindrance, is the barrier of entry for opportunities very high?
--------------------------------------------------

Stanford requesting Additional Financial Aid Docs
Hey, recent admit and wondering if anybody's been in this position before:

\- Aid is usually calculated from prior-prior year income (2019), but my family experienced a change in income from 2019 to 2020

\- Stanford is now requesting my 2020 prior-year tax returns

For anybody who Stanford requested prior-year info from, did your aid package end up being calculated from your prior-year income? Or your prior-prior year income? Or somewhere between the two?

Thanks a bunch in advance! If you/anyone you know has been in this position before, any details about the experience would be greatly appreciated.

Financial Aid
International here. Got accepted and requested financial aid. Submitted some documents later than they requested. They have asked for additional information after sending acceptance. I have sent it right away. 

- How quickly do they process this stuff in general? Any idea if Stanford finalizes their financial decision before the May 3 deadline for accepting the offer?

-  Other question I have is if they do not make their decision by May 3,would me accepting the offer mean I am declining financial aid? 

- Or could the financial aid determination continue after acceptance of the offer!  Thx a bunch!

I was admitted to Stanford for pre-med, but over the past few months, I've realized that I'm much more interested in studying CS. I'm planning to switch majors before school starts, so how do I convince my parents to let me take this path?
Sorry if this post isn't appropriate for the sub, but my parents are really adamant about me becoming a doctor. However, I know deep down that this isn't the path for me. I don't know how my parents would react if I told them I wanted to switch to CS, so how could I convince them?

Off-campus subsidized housing
Any grad students (single or couple) out there living in Oak Creek apts, the 825 Menlo Park apts, or Hawthorne apts that would share some of the pros/cons of living in these places? They all seem really nice based on floor plans and commute. And can anyone explain the housing priorities after your first year; can you not simply re-sign your lease? (I just don't see how that's not the easiest option for Stanford and the students). Do you have to re-enter the lottery with lower priority? 

My SO and I are also looking at the Escondido Village low-rise and mid-rise units, they seem pretty nice as well.  In on-campus housing you can renew your lease without a problem, correct? 

Thanks in advance!

Stanford vs. MIT vs. Harvard?
Hi guys, I recently got all my decisions back, and I was incredibly fortunate to get to choose between Stanford, MIT, and Harvard. I’m looking to major in math/physics and I have some interest in CS + Econ. I’m trying to attend the admitted students events, but I’m still pretty undecided (unfortunately, I haven't had the chance to visit any of the campuses in real life). Location is not a large concern for me, and cost is roughly the same across all schools. Any thoughts on what school would be better for undergrad would be appreciated!

Edit: Sorry if my question seems a bit vague, I'd prefer if I could DM people who are available to talk about specifics, thanks!
--------------------------------------------------
Waitlist advice?
Hi guys! I was recently waitlisted and would really really love to attend. Unfortunately Stanford only allows a 500 character update form so I can’t be as descriptive as I would like in demonstrating my interest. I’m currently having a hard time figuring out what I should put in the response box as I want make it as impactful as possible. I was going to just list some accomplishments, but I don’t know if there’s something better I should put in there. Do you have any advice? And is there anything else that you think I can do to get off the waitlist? I know it’s going to be very unpredictable this year.

How normal will summer quarter be?
Hey guys,

As vaccinations speed up, it seems pretty reasonable to say that California should be operating at a level at least close to normal by June. With a lot of students taking their flex quarter in the spring and expressing interest to be on campus for a quarter, how normal do you think summer quarter on campus will be?

Obviously there won’t be as many students on campus, but I’m more talking about dorm life, the gyms, small gatherings, etc.

Stanford Dorm Reviews 🏠
Hello Stanford students and alumni! I and a few other students are thinking of creating an unofficial, student-created dorm review platform to help ease the stress of navigating the housing options at Stanford. We're hoping this will be an easy way for you to rate the dorms you've lived in, and then see other student ratings to choose where you'd like to live. But we need your help to prototype this concept!

Class of 2025
Anybody know when Stanford announces if next year is virtual (like MIT this year), or Optional (Harvard)? I’m just extremelyyyy nervous and haven’t decided whether I want to commit here, so I’m curious as to whether or not I’d go across the country next semester.
--------------------------------------------------
Introvert at Stanford?
I’ve just been admitted to Stanford 2025, and I’m feeling...a lot. Excited and incredibly grateful, but also nervous as hell. I’m fairly introverted and always pictured myself at a small liberal arts school, but the chance to go to Stanford is golden and I feel like I can’t pass it up. To artsy quiet types at Stanford who aren’t particularly interested in CS, Greek life, or football (if you exist!!) what has your experience been like? How did you find your community? Any input helps. Thanks!

Columbia vs Stanford
This week, I have been accepted into Columbia and Stanford, and I'm struggling with making a choice. I want to study to computer, but I'm open to other STEM disciplines. Also, please don't say go to Stanford because they have a better computer science program. I got a likely from Columbia and accepted into the CUSP program, but Stanford was my dream school up until this year.

I'm queer, Black, and from the suburbs of Missouri, and I want to experience something new. I'm a bit of an introvert, but I generally get along with most people. Activism and diversity are also very important to me.

If you go to/graduated from Stanford, can you answer these questions?

* For cs students, how big were your intro classes?
* Is there mental health support?
* For Black people (especially women), how did your peers treat you?
* Do you feel rushed with the quarter system?
* And anything else I should know about the school.

Graduate School Funding
Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

Have any of you had to consider rejecting a Stanford offer due to financial reasons? I was admitted into the graduate program of my dreams but am facing a lot of financial difficulties connected with Covid, medical issues in my household, ect. For years I have postponed my graduate studies for many reasons. I have a very unique and time-sensitive research thesis project in mind. I am an older independent student and not in a position to take out large loans. I have applied for some grants but I will most likely have to decline. Have any of you successfully procured last-minute funding independently? I know how absurd it must sound to give up on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity like Stanford.  I feel so lost.

&#x200B;

Thanks

Double Majoring Restrictions
Hello! I was just wondering if it is possible to double major at Stanford, with one major as a BA and the other as a BS? And if it isn't, is it possible to do with a secondary major program instead? Thank you so much!

Getting Involved with Research
I've been trying in vain to get a research assistant position in the humanities/social sciences this past year. I've been using the standard application channels and was wondering how other people found research positions. Does anyone have advice for standing out in a standardized application process? Does anyone have alternate means of getting a position? I absolutely do not want to give up on this so pls send any and all ideas! :)

Making money at Stanford
Hi I know this stuff seems super conceited to many people and “money isn’t everything”, but my family situation is pretty bad and my parents are going to be thousands of dollars in medical debt. So as a class of 2025 student my question is what major and career path can I take to maximize my earnings and help support my family. Again please keep the hate to yourself I understand “happiness > money” but I need to make money for my family. Thank you for all your help.

Gift ideas for my undergrad research professors from a decade ago?
So I had a good rapport with my senior research professor at Stanford. I haven't met him in person for over a decade though we face-timed 3 years ago to discuss possibility of publishing my work with him. We didn't go through as I got ill and went out of touch. We got back in touch. I don't think we will discuss publishing but he invited me for lunch at his house before I leave the state.  Any ideas what an appropriate thing would be to bring? expensive bottle of wine? but thought it is weird for lunch.

&#x200B;

Any ideas appreciated, 

thanks,

safety for single women living on-campus?
Hi! incoming grad student here and deciding on housing options. Since I'm leaning towards taking studio hence living alone, how is the safety around the campus area, especially around the graduate housing?

Thank you in advance!

Research Opportunities for Engineering
Hello,
I’m debating between attending Stanford and University of Rochester. One of my decision points revolves around research. I know at University of Rochester you can start research as early as freshman year. Is that similar at Stanford? Also, are you able to do research in something that’s not your major?

Thanks in advanced!

UCLA or Stanford??
Hello!!!!! First off, I just wanna say how extremely happy I am to have been accepted to Stanford's Class of 2025!! This is truly such a huge honor for me and my family, and I wanna be upfront when I say the people who attend Stanford (at least in my experience) are so incredibly freaking smart. Seriously, you guys are crazy intelligent and I hope I get to join you all next year :-)

Really quickly, I was wondering if anyone can give me any insight into what I should do. I have received admission from Berkeley, UPenn, Brown (for PLME too!), and UCLA, and atm I'm currently debating between UCLA and Stanford. For context, I applied as a linguistics/bioengineering major (almost certainly Pre-Med) to these schools, but that can be subject to change.

The main reason I am debating which school to go to is because of finances. Neither UCLA nor Stanford offers me any financial aid, but being a CA Resident my cost of UCLA will be half of that of Stanford. I understand that I will be totally happy at whichever school I attend, and that I am so incredibly grateful to have such amazing options, but I would really appreciate any insight anyone on this sub can give. On a quick note, does anyone have any tips on negotiating/appealing financial aid at Stanford? Or the feasibility of working while studying? Again, I would appreciate any insight whatsoever anyone may give.

Thank you guys so much for reading this post all the way through, and go Trees! :-)

Edit: just btw this is for undergrad if that wasn't made clear. thank you all a lot!

Potential Vaccine requirements for fall
Howdy! I was just wondering what y'all thought about Persis Drell's email stating that there might be a covid vaccine requirement for on campus people in the fall. I understand the good that comes from the vaccines and I would even get one myself, but doesn't it seem a little draconian to force this upon the students that just want a little return to normalcy?

--------------------------------------------------
Congrats, ProFros!
I think undergrad decisions come out in under an hour, so am posting a little in advance so this gets approved on time. If you’re here before decisions are out: really good luck, and come back in a bit. :)

First and foremost, huge congratulations to those who got in. It’s an amazing achievement, and as upperclassmen, we’re super excited to have you on campus—(hopefully IRL campus by the sounds of things)! I think I speak for a lot of us when I say freshmen make up most of my favourite people on campus every year. And freshmen year at Stanford is really special and wonderful for many students here, so I hope you love every minute of it.

If people are happy to talk to ProFros with questions, maybe those people could comment below—or mods, maybe we could make a bigger thread for that purpose?

Secondly, some advice to those who got in—(everything below here is my opinion, so feel free to ignore it.) 100% celebrate your achievement, but if you come from a more privileged background, do try and be humble and aware of the background that helped get you here. I’m sure you did a ton of work to get to this point, but there’s often a lot of privilege and/or luck involved too, and that’s totally fine—many of us (including me) are here because of unfair advantages we had in early life, and it’s normal. People at Stanford will like you more for being actively aware of this, I promise. You’re also not an imposter, whether you come from a privileged background or not. You all belong here as much as any of us.

(Last piece of advice: remember that some other people are less happy than you right now—colleges can’t accept everyone, and it seems like acceptance rates were especially low this year—so publicly flexing all the Ivies you got into on social media might not be the... kindest thing to do. Again this applies even more if you’re from a more privileged background. And “Should I go to Stanford or Harvard, wow, such a hard decision...” definitely counts as flexing, I’m afraid...)

To those who didn’t get in to their dream school, Stanford or not: I’m so so sorry. Be aware this system is definitely unfair, biased, and random, so a rejection is very much *not* a statement about you. Everyone says this, but it’s definitively true: the application system is just not at all good. Several Stanford students I know were rejected from every Ivy we applied to, and there is absolutely no reason we could not have been rejected by Stanford too—we were just the lucky ones. So go nail your undergrad, and come back to Stanford for grad school. Then rub it in all the undergrads’ faces. :)

How time consuming are studio art classes like ARTSTUDIO 140?
Title says it all. I'm kind of having a crises with my currently classes and want to switch in to 1 or 2 more "chill" classes. For those of you who have taken studio art classes at Stanford, how time consuming were they? I'm particularly interested in drawing I or painting I. I do have some natural art ability if that helps. Thanks!

The ones on the west campus are very well-clustered, but the eastern neighborhoods are really spread out. Wouldn't it be better if they were all clustered to help build community in that space? (Rather than isolating pockets of the same neighborhood among other neighborhoods?) What's the logic?

Help a FoShoFro out
Hey everyone! I'm currently a prefrosh at Stanford and I'm looking to get the language requirement out of the way by taking Chinese 3 at my local community college. Problem is that the class I'm trying to take is not on this table: [https://registrar.stanford.edu/students/transfer-credit](https://registrar.stanford.edu/students/transfer-credit) and I'm not allowed to ask for preapproval because only current students are able to do that.

I don't want to waste 100 hours on a course that might count for nothing, so I would super super appreciate it if somebody could fill out the preapproval form for me and let me know if my course counts for the language requirement. Please dm or comment if you'd be willing to help! Thanks so much!!!

Best on campus housing for first year graduate student?
I've seen a couple posts like this, but they're not super recent and maybe a few new people will see this one. Important criteria for me: good location on campus, not exorbitantly expensive, easy to meet new people, well-built / nice rooms. Also, any thoughts on 4 bed vs. 2 bed?

So far my top 3 are: Rains, Munger, EVGR.

Any opinions and/or experiences are welcome!

&#x200B;

Edit: Yes munger is expensive, it's probably also the best. Unfortunately none of the places meet all the requirements.

Thoughts?
It's driving me insane that Stanford hasn't uttered a word about next year (as far as I've been able to find). Other schools have stated their plans for next year and it feels so frustrating that Stanford's been holding out when we're at a time of year where we'd otherwise be drawing for next year. Basically I just needed to vent but am also curious what others think about the situation - is there an upcoming marker that I'm missing that it would make sense for them to release info?

Question on Summer 2021 from a confused frosh
Hey everyone,

I’m a Frosh and pretty confused on whether the university plans on allowing all Frosh and sophomores back on campus this summer to enroll full time (obviously barring deterioration in the COVID situation in Santa Clara), or if the Flex term/ Experiential Learning Opportunities rules still apply for everyone. For example, as a frosh, if I enrolled full time remotely during the fall, winter, and spring quarters, would I be able to enroll full time and take classes while on campus during the summer, or do I still have to take a flex term and have an experiential learning opportunity (ELO) to get on campus? 

I’m pretty sure the summer class schedule this year is much more extensive than previous years so I think it would be possible to enroll full time, but I’m wondering if I’d be allowed to do so. If not, time to rush to get an ELO lined up lol. 

In my eyes, it would make sense for the university to try to get all or most frosh and sophomores on campus (pandemic conditions allowing) for at least one quarter of the academic year. Not to mention, they won’t have any high school students on campus this year, so that can potentially have an effect on the university’s on-campus capacity.

Any responses are appreciated.

This might be an odd question but are there any clubs/professors/resources I could access for free that could provide mentorship or answer questions for non academic related CS projects?

Grad meal block question
The R&DE website lists meal blocks separated by breakfast/lunch/dinner. The “flex” plan seems to be priced at the dinner rate. My question is, if I purchase a meal block of, say, 50 breakfast meals, could I use it to get a lunch or dinner sometimes, or am I limited to only breakfast? The 50 breakfasts plan costs $287.50 — does that act like a balance I deduct against, or 50 card swipes to be used on breakfast only?

I guess I’m wondering if we’re restricted to a specific meal/time of day. If that’s the case, would it make sense for me to buy the lunch plan so I could squeeze in late breakfasts and early dinners?

Dating in grad school?
Hey folks, I'm a second year grad student here! I've been super excited to finally be living on campus since January.

I did my undergrad in the American South East (tryna be vague b/c I'm sure someone here knows my real name :) ) in which many folks 1) had that undergrad, ephemeral, unhealthy relationship vibe or 2) didn't know what they were looking for.

In grad school, especially at Stanford, my classmates/labmates/etc. seem much more grounded and know themselves and their relationship/friendship 'wants' a lot better. In general, how would you say the folks in Stanford grad programs view dating? I know tons of folks who find their life partner here and go on to do great things together through a happy relationship and mutually-beneficial professional support system.

I am interested in someone who works in one of my labs. (We don't work in the same project/scope/bubble and I **don't** want to make things feel weird for us.) We've been friends for a few months, chatting on and off, finding a time to hang out in the next week or so. What do you think the best way to approach this situation would be? I would like to be friends regardless. 

Maybe this is more an r-slash-relationships question! But I think Stanford grad school definitely has a different character to it. Roast me..

I was advised by an alum (Stanford Phd from 20 years ago, works in Bay area tech) that CS is getting saturated and I should do engineering, specifically genetics, as its a lucrative and growing field. I think CS is easier for me to grasp (only took CS106A so far) than my math/physics/chem classes, but do not know if its worth pursuing over engineering. Interest level is about the same.

[Fin Aid Q] How does the expected family contribution work?
International co'25 admit here. I haven't committed yet but I'd say I will 97% choose Stanford.

Does the number represent the exact amount that my family is expected to pay regardless of the actual tuition charged?

Context: I'm struggling between taking the APs to substitute intro-level class credits or not. It would be nice if I can save some bucks by coming in with more AP credits, but I also heard some intro classes are really good. I really hate studying for the subjects I do not take at school without interactions so I might just take the intro classes if that does not affect the budget.

Thanks ahead.

PhD TOEFL waiver
I am planning to apply for a PhD in Learning Science and Design Technology. As an international applicant, I need to submit a TOEFL score or apply for a waiver. However, I am not sure if I can apply for the TOEFL waiver. I got my taught master's degree (1-year program) from the University of Hong Kong where English is considered to be the lingua franca but I am not sure if Stanford would recognize it as eligible for the TOEFL waiver. Anybody here help clarify?

How does expected family contribution in financial aid work?
International co'25 admit here. I haven't committed yet but I'd say I will 97% choose Stanford.

Does the number represent the exact amount that my family is expected to pay regardless of the actual tuition charged?

Context: I'm struggling between taking the APs to substitute intro-level class credits or not. It would be nice if I can save some bucks by coming in with more AP credits, but I also heard some intro classes are really good. I really hate studying for the subjects I do not take at school without interactions so I might just take the intro classes if that does not affect the budget.

Thanks ahead.
--------------------------------------------------
Final Exam?
According to [https://registrar.stanford.edu/students/final-exams](https://registrar.stanford.edu/students/final-exams), Stanford does not allow classes to have final exams because of the pandemic. Since this holds true, if a class that is offered has a final exam, should we notify the instructor assuming the class does not fall into the professional schools mentioned in the URL?

Easy A+ Classes for the Spring
Looking for easy A+ Spring classes to pad my GPA. I have all my WAYs except A-II, so I'm not particularly looking for WAYs courses, but some A-II recommendations would also be appreciated! I looked at Sleep and Dreams, but (1) it's full, and (2) it seems a bit backloaded, which is unfortunate since I have some other project classes this quarter...

Anyway, if anyone has any suggestions, please comment them below! Thanks!

Should I wait to take cs111 or wait to take ENGR40M?
Ok, here's the super oddly specific dilemma I'm in: I need to choose between cs110 and engr40m this quarter to finalize my schedule.

The argument to wait for cs110 is to be able to take the new cs111 course another quarter (can't take it this quarter because it conflicts with a class), and also cs110 is supposedly more work than engr40m according to carta so I can wait until I have a lighter quarter.

The argument to wait for engr40m is to take it in person -- I imagine engr40m being an ee class would benefit more from being in person than cs110/111.

In short, two questions: cs110 vs engr40m in terms of workload and benefit of being in person

Jobs on campus?
Hey everyone, I will be joining Masters in MS&E this autumn as an international student. I'd like to find some sort of job to support me while I'm studying, and because of my visa status, the only viable options are RA/CA-ship and on-campus employment. My question is about the latter -- are these jobs too much in demand, do they pay enough to cover living expenses and in general, how hard/easy is it to get one? Any experience/statistic/anecdote is appreciated.

I'm just curious tbh...
when you look at summer quarter tuition billing for undergraduates, it goes up to 25 units. does that mean that we can take 25 units of classes in summer quarter, if we wanna enroll? again, totally just curious, no way I'm actually really considering doing this...thanks!!

Grad student clubs?
Hi there! I was recently admitted to Stanford as a grad student to a pretty small program (under 30 students in the cohort). 

It seems from our program website there aren’t many extracurricular opportunities, so can we join clubs at other schools like GSB instead? 

Thanks for your help!
--------------------------------------------------
Classes with easy work?
Like I’m talking really really easy. Basically just wanna coast this quarter and still rack up units

Grad housing
Hi all, I am an incoming grad student who is finding the housing options and application process a bit overwhelming to navigate. These are a few questions that I have come up with:

In your opinion, what are some of the pros and cons of living on/off campus? 

I know that first years are given more priority in housing assignments, but what are the odds of being assigned first/second choices?

I prefer to live in a single unit and don't have any dependents, what is the best option?

Munger sounds nice and is the closest to many places, but I see that it doesn't offer renewable contracts, how inconvenient is this in real life? Has anyone been able to renew their contracts despite what it says on the website?

Any off-campus options that you would recommend (for single units)?

Can ppl still eat at the dining halls if they live off-campus?

One more question about parking:
How difficult is it to find a parking spot (with an "A" permit) during the day? At the Oval or nearby?


Thanks so much for reading through these. Any response will be greatly appreciated.

Entrepreneurship
I'm a teenager programming an online forum and fashion game and want to major in CS. How is entrepreneurship seen at Stanford? Is it common? Will it get in the way of education?
--------------------------------------------------
Concerns over startup culture
One of the bigger worries I have from committing is the large focus towards startup culture. I’ve heard that the majority of students involve themselves in founding startups. I’m not necessarily interested in this entrepreneurship path. As a hopeful computer science major, I see it’s quite big for people to join this culture. Will I be an odd-one out for not wanting to join the entrepreneurship culture?

p.s. I’m also super ignorant when it comes to sports and I’m not a sports fan— how’s that going to work out? are sports ignorable or is it vital to campus culture?

How long do you think classes will be online?
I think we’ll all be back to campus in the fall but classes will be hybrid, but I’m curious to see if people think winter/spring will be fully normal. I think other schools will return to fully in-person classes, but with Stanford being in SCC and as risk-averse as it is I have no clue.

Question about the Knight - Hennessy Scholarship (not admissions questions)
Hi everyone, I just had some questions about the benefits for the Knight - Hennessy program. I was reading about it online, but was hoping to get some specific information. I know it covers tuition, but it also says you receive a stipend that helps cover housing and other expenses. I was wondering if anyone know the exact amount that is given? Is it enough to cover housing off campus or does it only cover on - campus housing?

Good introductory courses to take during Spring?

Is there a Dance group that performs multiple dance styles?
'Bhangra Stanford' performs Bhangra. 'Urban Styles' does Jazz. 'Alliance' does streetdance. And so on for many many groups. So, is there a dance group that explores multiple dance styles ranging from Hip Hop to contemporary to jazz to streetdance and likewise?

Does the 'Legacy Dance Group' do that?

Help Picking Easy-ish Math class for Spring
I'm stuck picking between Math 108: Introduction to Combinatorics with Matt Kwan, Math 106: Functions of a Complex Variable with Wojciech Wieczorek, and Math 120: Group Theory with Pawel.

Looking for something light-ish. Also looking for good pedagogy. Anyone got any recs? 120 and 106 seem like more work just based on their syllabi. I'm also open to other math classes that don't have a lot of pre-reqs. 171 looked pretty awesome, but I haven't taken 115.

Emotional support animal (ESA) housing accommodation
Hi! I’m an incoming PhD student and planning on applying for subsidized on-campus housing. I’m working on getting ESA paperwork to request a housing accommodation to bring my cat. My PCP has agreed to provide a letter and asked if there is a template or guide of sorts, as it is his first time preparing this kind of document.

Does anyone have experience with the ESA housing accommodation process or getting such a letter? I would really appreciate any tips and advice. Thank you!

Edit: I’ve already gone through all the info online and sent the guide to my PCP, but he was asking for a template (like what Medical-Reaction8600 offered) or something more specific than the general info provided.

Programs similar to Stanford's CCRMA
Hey everyone,

I'm interested in what this program has to offer, but I realize that Stanford is a little bit of a reach to think I'd get into.

A Guide to Paying Taxes at Stanford
I have noticed a couple of posts here and on SMC about taxes on financial aid. It's evident to me that many students are struggling with this and Stanford will provide you with little information to aid the process. This tax-law was updated quite a bit in 2018 so many of the resources you find online will be outdated. I am not a tax professional and this is not tax advice, but I'm a low-income student who despises paying taxes on my higher education Financial Aid.

**Learn more directly from the IRS with 2020** [**Publication 970.**](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p970.pdf)

^(\*Tax information for international students is a different process that is much more student-specific.)

**1098-T**: This is an [IRS form](https://sfs.stanford.edu/taxes/resources) that you will find on Axess that tells you how much money Stanford gave you (Box 5)  and how much of that money went towards qualified expenses (Box 1) only in that tax year. You might see numbers in Box 4 and Box 6 because you went on an LOA or Stanford made adjustments. In this case, you will need to request an "Itemized 1098-T" from Student Services and you might need to amend a previous tax year.

My Axess --> Taxes --> View/Grant 1098-T or request one via Student Services Help Ticket.

**Qualified Tuition Related Expense** [(QTRE)](https://sfs.stanford.edu/taxes/us-citizen-and-resident-alien-students): Qualified expenses are NOT taxable income.

* Tuition
* Required Fees (Doc Fee, Student Activities Fee, Student Health Fee)\*
* Course Fees for degree-related classes (Chem Lab Fee via ePay Check Payment)
* Athletic Scholarships, to some extent, [see Pub. 970](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p970.pdf)
* Insurance Scholarships\*\*

**What does not qualify?**

* Housing, House Dues, Technology Fee\*\*\*
* Meal Plan\*\*\*
* Refunds
* Insurance Scholarships\*\*
* Personal expenses, travel, moving costs, etc.

^(\*The Student Activities Fee and Document Fee is likely already assessed as part of Box 1. The Health Services Fee is not included in Box 1 so it must be manually calculated when you file. Use the itemized 1098-T from student services for your specific calculation.)

^(\*\* If Stanford provides you a scholarship for Cardinal Care, this amount will not be calculated into Box 1 automatically as a QTRE. However, this is required for all students to attend and can be manually calculated as a QTRE when filing your taxes. Insurance Premiums do NOT count as a QTRE for the purpose of Education credits and deductions (i.e. AOTC or LLC)) ^(even if paid out of pocket.)

^(\*\*\* Even though undergraduates are required to have a meal plan and 97% of students live on campus, you can technically still choose to live off-campus and not purchase a meal plan. Since most colleges don't have such requirements, it is not acceptable for one student to deduct room and board at Stanford, when a student who chose to attend a community college cannot deduct their rent and groceries. There is no exception to this IRS rule--room and board is not a QTRE in any situation.  House dues and the tech fee are not assessed to every student, only those who 'chose' to live on campus so they can not be counted as QTRE.)

**Unearned Income:** Income you have received that was not in exchange for services such as your financial aid scholarships. This is subject to [Kiddie Tax](https://www.thetaxadviser.com/issues/2016/apr/kiddie-tax-may-be-due-on-college-scholarships.html) for minors and dependents, however, because CA is a [non-conformity state](https://www.taxcpe.com/blogs/news/kiddie-tax-non-conformity), Unearned Income Tax is assessed for Full-Time students under the age of 24. When you file, you will pay both Federal Income Tax and State Income Tax subject to unearned income tax. Kiddie Tax was created to prevent parents from sheltering money from the IRS in their children, but accidentally had a huge negative impact on low-income families. If someone claims you as a dependent, your non-QTRE scholarship will likely be subject to Kiddie Tax.

**A side note on Stipends, Grants, and Fellowships:**

Fellowships, grants, and other stipends are not already taxed when you receive them--Stanford will not withhold taxes for you. These will look like lump-sum payments on your Axess billing, as opposed to hourly wages. If this funding was used for non-QTRE, it must be reported as taxable income (See Form 1040 and 1098-T). A wage or payroll job (RA, TA, etc.) will be taxed through a W-2 that you can find on Axess--this is a different type of income compared to a scholarship or fellowship.

Undergrads-- If you worked a summer research job, internship, or whatever and they provided a 'stipend' for anything (housing, funding, cardinal quarter, Frosh101, etc.), this is income you need to report to the IRS unless they specifically gave a tax-form for this stipend (and I doubt they will). Stanford will not pay these taxes on your behalf-- it might already be reported on your 1098-T so ask for an itemized report!

**Education Credits**: The IRS will grant you credits or deductions when you pay out-of-pocket expenses on QTRE. There is the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) and the Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC). Both have restrictions on income limits (MAGI). You cannot claim double benefits in the same year!

Eligibility requirements for [AOTC versus LLC](https://www.eitc.irs.gov/other-refundable-credits-toolkit/compare-education-credits/compare-education-credits)

*In the case of an audit, which is not uncommon for claiming credits, you must be able to provide definitive proof of your claims.*

^(Proof? You'll need all or a combination of the below:)

* ^(Receipts or other evidence showing you paid out-of-pocket for the expense (Stanford ePay))
* ^(Stanford requires all students to pay this) [^(expense)](https://exploredegrees.stanford.edu/tuitionfeesandhousing/#mealplanstext) ^(to enroll and attend)
* ^(Your Prof. and syllabus require this expense in order to enroll and attend the class)
* ^(The expense has no reasonable alternative (Free Version, Computer Cluster, School Library, etc.))

**AOTC:** Half-time or Full-time Stanford Undergrads seeking a degree are eligible  The amount of the credit is 100 percent of the first $2,000 of qualified education expenses you paid for each eligible student and 25 percent of the next $2,000 of qualified education expenses you paid for that student.  If you are on full financial aid at Stanford, you will likely only be able to claim very little from the AOTC because our only genuine out-of-pocket QTRE are course fees for major requirement classes like CHEM31.

**What can I claim?**

* Out of pocket QTRE (not scholarship $$)
* Mandatory degree-related course fees (e.g. Chem Lab Fee)
* Mandatory degree-related supplies (e.g. Stanford Lab Coat)
* Computer Programs explicitly required by a Prof. not free on cluster computers (Octave v. Matlab)
* Required single-use access codes (e.g. Mastering Physics)
* Books required by a course to enroll

**What can I NOT claim?**

* A laptop or iPad\*
* Books that are only recommended by a Prof.
* Books that are readily available and free for check-out at Stanford Library
* Study aids like note-taking apps or Chegg (sadly)
* School Supplies (backpack, pencils, etc. unless explicitly required for a required class like ART)

^(\*Even though it is basically essential to have a laptop at Stanford, you cannot actually claim this expense because the school offers free access to 24/7 computer clusters and check-out laptops. Stanford explicitly states that students are NOT required to own a personal computer to enroll and attend any of the) *^(Undergraduate)* ^(Degree programs (certain Graduate programs follow different rules) This) [^(court case example)](https://www.currentfederaltaxdevelopments.com/blog/2016/8/25/purchase-of-computer-from-local-retailer-did-not-qualify-for-american-opportunity-tax-credit) ^(from Berkeley.)

**LLC:**  Mostly used by < full-time students and graduate students. The amount of the credit is 20 percent of the first $10,000 of qualified education expenses or a maximum of $2,000 per return. The LLC is not refundable. So, you can use the credit to pay any tax you owe but you won’t receive any of the credit back as a refund.

What can I claim?

* Tuition, fees, and supplies required to purchase (out-of-pocket) *directly from the school*, so long as it's a condition of enrollment.

&#x200B;

**Ok, I'm ready to file!**

1. Download your **1098-T** from Axess or request a copy from student services. Give this 1098-T to your accountant, parents, personal records, or whoever files your taxes.
2. If your Box 5 is LARGER than your Box 1, request an "**Itemized 1098-T**" from Stanford Student Services for that tax-year. This will explain exactly how each box has been calculated and is essential for accurately filing.
3. Determine your calculated **QTRE** (Box 1 + Required Fees Stanford didn't report)
4. Calculate your total **taxable unearned income** from scholarships (Box 5 - Calculated QTRE)
5. Determine if you're eligible for any education credits (**AOTC or LLC**)
6. Provide this information to your account, parents, or online filing systems (I use [freetaxusa.com](https://freetaxusa.com))

&#x200B;

**What exactly will I owe?**

If you determine that your total amount of scholarship is greater than your QTRE, you will have taxable unearned income to report to the IRS. This will incur both federal income taxes and possibly unearned income taxes  (if you're under 24). Your total taxable scholarship + your normal income from the year determines the rate at which you are taxed. If you are on full financial aid and did not withhold taxes from your job or internship, your tax burden is going to be high (like as much as $2000+ for one year).

&#x200B;

FAQ:

**Does the IRS know how much Stanford gave me?**

* Yes, the 1098-T form is submitted to IRS on your behalf from Stanford just like a W-2.

**Who needs to file a return?**

* Anyone who receives a 1098-T, especially students who receive a room and board scholarship.  Room and board alone >> Standard deduction, you are required to file. *Just because you have a taxable scholarship, does not necessarily mean you will owe any money.*

**I didn't pay taxes a previous year (or my parents didn't).**

* Unfortunately, you'll need to amend your taxes to make corrections. Underreported income and tax evasion is a common and serious offense that can incur penalties, fines, and even charges (even if you were genuinely unaware). Amending your taxes is your best opportunity to pay the least without facing the scrutiny of the IRS--it's not hard if you use an online service either. Taxes have a statute of up to three years; many audits for education will occur in the later half of the statute--just because you got away with it this year does not mean you're safe. Serious offenses can go back even more years.

**I claimed credits that I was not eligible for.**

* You'll need to pay these back and amend. Claiming education credits that don't align with your 1098-T make you more likely to be flagged by the IRS  for a second-look or audit. Proving you can claim credits can be very difficult during an audit.

**This sucks...I can't afford these taxes...what can I do?**

* Stanford does not consider tax burden as part of an undergraduate student's academic year expenses or student responsibility, despite the fact that taxes might be your largest expense of the school year. Reach out to financial aid and tell them what burden taxes have on you or your family as a direct result of your "no strings attached" financial aid package. **Taxes should not be a barrier to undergraduate education at a school like Stanford, especially when it impacts the lowest-income students the most.** At the very least, they can make a better effort to educate students on their potential tax burden. At the most, they can withhold taxes on our behalf or include them in our scholarship.
* Withhold estimated taxes quarterly, like a savings account.

**What if I don't report my scholarship as income?**

* Some people never get caught for underreporting income or tax evasion. But let's be realistic for a moment...the IRS knows you receive taxable scholarships via 1098-T. It might be statistically unlikely, but if they audit you a couple of years from now, you're going to be facing significant fees and penalties for not paying these taxes. 4 years on full financial aid you never reported? That can be more than $80,000 in unreported income and $10,000 in unpaid federal and state taxes + penalties. This is not something to take lightly as a student or if your parents are responsible.

**My accountant didn't pay for these taxes a previous year.**

* Accountants/CPAs mess up, especially when it comes down to education. If they never received your 1098-T, they couldn't have filed this income in the first place. Even then, without an itemized 1098-T from  Stanford, they likely didn't file correctly. At the end of the day, your tax person is just trying to maximize your refund and would prefer not to explain a 2K tax bill from your financial aid. If they made an error, they will often amend your taxes for you.

**What if my scholarship is a Federal Pell Grant/FAFSA or outside award?**

* The same rules apply. If it used towards QTRE, it is tax-free. If your Pell Grant is used for room and board, for example, it is NOT tax-free. An outside award provider may withhold taxes on your behalf, however, this is rare and should otherwise be treated like all other awards. This applies to money given directly to you or directly to Stanford. If your program gives you money directly, you ~~should~~ are required to report this money to Stanford via Axess.

As I said, I'm by no means a tax professional, but I think I have a decent grasp on this material. Let me know if I misspoke or left out anything. Just trying to help low-income students navigate this tax-hell.

I basically have a black box in my brain around CME 100 and CME 102. How fucked am I/how do I review the math before higher level classes?
The latter of which I took during spring 2020, hopefully that gives some context as to why I've forgotten it all even though I got credit. I took CME 100 during my freshman fall and was pretty engrossed in trying to make friends, which, along with some residual senior-slide attitudes toward studying, resulted in me getting a B, so I wasn't super solid to begin with. I'm disappointed with past me, and since then I've been trying to study a lot harder and actually absorb course content. Reading some posts about how MATLAB is so useful and differential calculus is so important I feel pretty hopeless, basically magnifying how all the opportunities Stanford offers are passing me by - but that's too deep for this post. Basically, which upper level mechanical or electrical engineering courses absolutely require MATLAB/ODEs and does anyone have experience refreshing their knowledge in these classes?

From Buenos Aires, visiting SF - looking for advice
Hi everyone.

My name is Ariel Reznik and I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I am currently studying Industrial Engineering in Instituto Tecnológico de Buenos Aires. I am very interested in urban planning and urbanism.

Because of the COVID-19 I'm studying online so I'm planning to travel to San Francisco, where my sister lives, for a month in March-April. I was looking to have an educational experience such as a short course or a workshop to extend my knowledge and be exposed to interesting learning activities which I wouldn't be able to encounter in Buenos Aires.

I don't know what the situation is in Stanford specifically in regards to the pandemic. It would suuuuuper cool to attend a course at your university. However, if attendance is currently impossible, I would appreciate if you have any recommendations or you know some place where I could find things like this.

Thanks a lot in advance!
--------------------------------------------------
Grade policy for letter grade assignments?
Does anyone know if Stanford has a general policy about what values (percentage) get you a specific letter grade? I’m looking for the baseline one - so, we know instructors can curve grades, but not the other way around. 

In one of my classes, they made the A+ over 99 (as in a 99 gets you an A, but a 99.4 gets you an A+), but they lowered the bar for an A. So, you have to ace *everything* for an A+ - literally, can’t even miss one question on an exam. 

I remember reading the policy and looking at the buckets for letter grade distribution, but I can’t find it now. So, if anyone knows where it is (and has specific values assigned to specific letters), please post it. I’m trying to petition this if I can, because if there is a minimum set, they can’t just lower it like that(?).

Thanks!

Request: Tour of the campus
Hi everyone. I’m visiting California with my family next weekend. And was wondering if there’s anyone who could give a tour type thing for my 11 year old nephew. He’s been saying he wants to go to Stanford bc his favorite math teacher is a Stanford alum. I’d love to take you to lunch if you’d like too. It’ll be 5 of us. My sister her husband and my nephew, niece (3y.o. A little early for college maybe ...) and me. 

Thank you. Please let me know if it’s a possibility. If not allowed, please delete it. Thank you.

Do postdocs (and/or residents) pay the student or the staff daily rate at the Stanford golf course?
Hi all -- I'm interested in playing a round or three of golf at the Stanford golf course, having not really played any non-miniature golf since the age of ~8. The [discounted student rates](https://www.stanfordgolfcourse.com/golf) look very enticing; the faculty / staff rates, somewhat less so. Does anyone here happen to know which ones apply to postdocs and residents (considered separately -- though I think residents are also classified as postdocs internally)? 

I tried calling / emailing the golf course to ask, but their response was basically "if you're considered a student, you'll pay the student rate; if staff, the staff rate; wtf is a postdoc get off my back yo". I'm honestly not too sure, because my understanding is that postdocs are considered Schrodinger's students, of sorts, counting as one or the other as best conveniences the university (it being a training position, but also not receiving e.g. a 1098-T or paying tuition).

Also, it looks like [club rental](https://www.stanfordgolfcourse.com/images/documents/COVID-19_GC_UpdatedProtocols_3_16_2021.pdf) is suspended atm due to COVID -- anyone know a good place I can either rent clubs or else buy used clubs for cheap (I remember long ago getting them for a buck apiece at thrift stores -- our standards are extremely low, so they don't have to be, as one might say, "good").

Looking to Sublease
(M,22) Hey guys, I’m looking to see if anyone is interested in subleasing their apartment or room for the summer only (May-August). 

I would prefer to sublease from someone college-aged if possible.

I am only here for an internship. I will be coming from Ohio, so my stipend should be enough to cover all costs of rent upfront. 

If I am looking in the wrong place, any help to point me in the right direction would be much appreciated. Thanks guys. DMs will be open.

Keeping Fish?
Hey guys!

Asking this for a friend.... 

Said friend is currently living on campus. I’m aware that pets are not allowed in dorms, but this friend has really been going crazy with COVID and everything else. At home, they are an avid fish keeper and taking care of an aquarium really helps ground them, so they are thinking of keeping a fish in their dorm room.

How easy is it to keep a fish on campus? In a normal year, are there routine room checks that they would have to worry about? Has anyone had any luck keeping fish/other pets?

UC Berkeley student curious about MSCS program
Hi - currently a student at Berkeley, had some questions regarding the MSCS program. As a MSCS student, are you allowed to apply for/do research in SAIL/other labs? Similarly, are you allowed to TA for classes as well or is that only reserved for Ph.D. students? Or are external MSCS students restricted to only taking classes? Thanks!

SLS
Any advice for a prospective student wanting to prepare for 0L before the start of 1L? What is the culture like in SLS and how are the faculty? Do you spend a lot of time on campus or off campus working? Do you get a chance to network with other people in the program? 
Any advice would be greatly appreciated 🥺🙏🏼

Cross-Uni Collaboration on Startups?
I'm super interested in the startups here and was wondering, especially with the dominance of remote work and everything on Zoom now, do Stanford students work with students at other top colleges across the country on startups? Is this even feasible? I thought it would be a really interesting concept propelled further by this remote work revolution we have now, but starting a startup completely remote (at least at the beginning) is probably pretty challenging. However, it might be useful to be able to draw from two completely different regions/networks.

Would love to know your thoughts!

CS/EE -- a little confused
I'm a class of '25 admit, and I'm a little unaware of the opportunities there are to take EE courses as a CS major. Since I'm also interested in EE, is it feasible to minor in EE? possibly double major? 

I would like to know more about that and the possibilities of researching in these fields -- is it common?

I was also admitted into MIT, and I know they offer an EECS major -- is there an equivalent at Stanford? I would also love to know more about how EE compares at both schools in rigor as I'm still indecisive between both and this is what's keeping me in limbo!

This is a very question dense post but thank you tremendously if you can answer!

Coterm unit count question

Any pilots here?
Hi everyone. I'm coming over to Stanford in the fall as a post-doc for the next two years. I'm a pilot with an EASA PPL(A) license and I was hoping to do some hour building while I'm there. I fly the C172M. I was wondering if there's any other pilots among Stanford students or researchers.

Where do you guys fly and what are the costs of renting planes? I saw there's an airport and air club quite close to Stanford, but also several other small airports nearby.

Thanks for the help!

CS142 reviews?

I don't mind taking in P/F, but wondering for those that have taken it if you would recommend taking the class or just learning web dev by yourself. Thank you!

Best On-Campus Graduate Housing for Couple without Children?
My partner got into a master's program at Stanford, and we're weighing the pros and cons of different living options. We're leaning towards living on campus to be immersed (we're from the east coast, so we want the "full experience*) and having a short class commute. 

The Kennedy midrise 1-bedroom seem to be the most available option for couples w/o children. Anyone currently living there have things they like/don't like about it? Would you recommend it to others or push for somewhere else? 

Any advice is much appreciated, thank you!

Intro Econ courses?
Hey, I'm a frosh planning on majoring in mechanical engineering, but I've always been interested in finance/economics as well. I have room in my schedule this quarter to add an econ course, and there are two that look appealing and I was wondering if I could get some idea of what students think about them, and which to take. Econ 1 of course, and Econ 43. Econ 1 seemed to be a no brainer, but Econ 43 sounds really interesting after reading some carta reviews. Anyway, which to take?

CS Partner Issues
I’m literally on my last nerve right now.

For the past four assignments for CS106B, I’ve been doing all the work.  My partner hasn’t lifted a finger, and whenever I need her to do something, I literally have to beg her and even then, sometimes she’ll just choose to completely ignore my messages.  I should’ve dropped her as a partner weeks ago, but I could never predict my workload for the next week, so I always had her as something I could fall back on since she did do the first couple of assignments very well.

Last week at 2am (right after I turned in the assignment), she comes to my door apologizing, saying that she would do the entire last assignment to make it up to me.  This was after she ignored all my texts in the morning asking her at least to write the test cases for the functions.  But I couldn’t really argue with her proposition, knowing my upcoming math exam will fuck me up if I don’t study all week for it.  She told me that I didn’t need to watch the lectures, and that she would take care of everything for me.

The only issue is, it’s less than 24hrs until the grace period ends, and she still hasn’t finished the assignment.  I called her yesterday and she was hanging out with people, and said she’d just work on it Saturday.  I already told her that I’ve been submitting all the assignments on time, even though I was working alone—submitting early was the least she could do.  I told her to send me the code and I’d just finish it, and she hasn’t responded since.

Now I’m on the final milestone after starting on the assignment from scratch this morning.  

I’ve been really dumb throughout this whole situation, but she was my best friend back in fall quarter, so I trusted her and didn’t want this to get in between our friendship.  I don’t really expect there’s anything really to be done with this.  My goal isn’t for her to get punished—she has been really good to me as a friend, so I want to see her succeed.  She just hasn’t been a good partner.

I just wanted to get this off my chest, so that I can finish the assignment in peace.  I haven’t really been able to talk to anyone about this, since majority of my friends are also her friends, and I didn’t want her to be viewed in that light.

But thanks for listening—hopefully I’ll finally be done with winter quarter tonight :,)

--------------------------------------------------
Math 51 in person vs online?
I really wanted to take math 51 next quarter (spring) but have been hearing terrible things about the online format. It's not an urgent class meaning I can push it back (but I probz won't get to taking it till next spring), but obviously I would prefer to get it done asap. 

Is it really as bad as everyone makes it out to be online? I've heard things along the lines of how you can't study for tests because they're so conceptual, how all studying is futile etc. If that's the case, I really don't want to take it online. But I don't know if they're just being dramatic. 

In the online format, is it possible to get an A-/A in math 51 just by studying or do you need to be really good at math like some people are insinuating? Also, are the grade distributions in the online course similar to the regular course? How much harder are the exams than the textbook problems?
--------------------------------------------------
Difference between Physics 40 series and 60 series.
I was not able to find a previous post on this subreddit that answered this question. Title says it all. I understand that the 60 series is a more advanced parallel series, but in what way? I did not take Physics in high school, but I have calculus. I want to learn physics very well, as I have developed an interest in pursuing something in the realm of theoretical physics research. I am worried that the 40 series might put me at a disadvantage, as I have heard that the 60 series is more theoretical. At the same time, I do not want to get in over my head. I would appreciate any advice. Also, does anyone think that, given what I want to do, it would be worth it to self-study Physics 40-level material over the summer so that I can take the 60 series next year? Thank you!
--------------------------------------------------
Russian textbooks?
Hi! To anyone who might have studied Russian at Stanford, what was the textbook (or textbooks) you were using in your classes? Was it one series or did the materials change? Also, I’d appreciate if anyone knows the rough estimation of what level is needed to be placed into 3rd/4th year (B2? C1?). 

Thanks!

Looking for Scholarships
Hi, so I was accepted to Stanford as a member of the class of '25. However, one thing that might keep me from attending is the cost because the financial office didn't give us any aid. My question is, where can I go to apply for some scholarships, both need-based and merit-based? Does Stanford have any alumni scholarships or something similar that I can apply for? Thank you in advance.

SL time commitment for first quarter
What's the time commitment like for SLs in the first quarter? I've heard from some that it's a lot and from others that it's only busy at the beginning of the quarter. As far as I know, it seems to be preparing for section, IGs, workshops, grading exams, and LAIR (seems like a lot now that I type it out). Is there anything else I'm not accounting for?

PSA: People living in shared housing* are now eligible to be vaccinated by Stanford Health Care
\*Shared housing/high-risk congregate housing as defined by the CDC ([link to guidelines here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/shared-congregate-house/guidance-shared-congregate-housing.html))-- seems to be things like "shared bathrooms/kitchens" etc. That would apply almost 100% to the undergrad dorms, but I'm not sure how applicable it is to grad housing.

You can see the Stanford Health Care page about vaccination appointments, locations, and guidelines here: [https://stanfordhealthcare.org/discover/covid-19-resource-center/patient-care/safety-health-vaccine-planning.html](https://stanfordhealthcare.org/discover/covid-19-resource-center/patient-care/safety-health-vaccine-planning.html)

If you check [myturn.ca.gov](https://myturn.ca.gov), it doesn't seem like this updated guidance is state-wide, so I don't know how much success you'll see trying to get an external appointment.

Hey guys, I know that the midterm is the killer, and that you need a strong math/stats background to keep up with the proofs. But what specific studying strategies would those of you who’ve gotten an A+ in this class recommend to do well in this class? Get fast at computing Hessians / taking integrals over probability distributions? Is it worth spending a lot of time to understand the proofs in the lecture notes? Thanks in advance, and if anyone wants to form a study group for this upcoming quarter message me :)

Anyone else feel super lost and confused?
Hi there,

These past several months of starting university have just made me more lost and confused than ever. I realized that I truly have no idea what I want to do in my life and I have no idea why I do the things I am currently doing. I feel like I completely lack direction and clarity, and I do not know what I want to study or what I want to do post-grad. All I want is to feel excited about something and feel like I am doing the right thing with my life. Coming into Stanford, I did not really have a plan-- I thought that I would figure things out as I went along which is what I have done for the past several years of my life, but that has not worked on for me this time.

Has anyone experienced a similar situation and does anyone have any advice on what to do to gain some sort of clarity at this stage? Part of me just wants to take some time off from school to really try to figure out what I want, part of me just wants to just pick something and go with it.

Thanks all

Has Canceling Exam Week Helped or Harmed Students? Quick Survey!
Some of you may have seen the Daily article this week about Stanford proposing to **[permanently eliminate final exam week](https://stanforddaily.com/2021/03/09/students-welcome-proposal-to-end-fall-quarter-before-thanksgiving-eliminate-final-exams/)**.

Are you rejoicing at the possibility of no more exam weeks? No more stress! No more holing up in the library to cram all night! Or are you too busy with lectures, problem sets, final projects, presentations, papers, and "Week 10 Midterms" to even read the article in question?

Did canceling exam week stop your professors from giving exams? Did it improve learning and reduce stress during the pandemic?

Please ANSWER THIS **SHORT, ANONYMOUS SURVEY** (and share it with your friends)! 
[https://forms.gle/oytTia1B5a2KemBy5](https://forms.gle/oytTia1B5a2KemBy5)

This is intended to understand how cancelling exam week has affected your academics and help propose a new quarter schedule that benefits **you**, the student! I hope to submit a report to the Stanford Daily (pm me for details). Make your voice heard!

Please take a few minutes out of your busy week to help.
Thank you!

Three Atypical Questions re: Stanford Graduate Housing
Hi!  I'm an incoming CS PhD student and I have a couple atypical questions regarding housing. If this isn't an acceptable place to ask, please direct me to the appropriate place :)

1. Where  I lived previously, my flatmates and I would host dinner socials every  Friday that were so much fun. I'd like to continue the tradition at  Stanford. What graduate housing is amenable to hosting semi-large  gatherings (\~30-50 people) on a weekly basis? If I want to host events  like these, do I need to live off campus?
2. Relatedly,  what are the best ways to find roommates/housemates who might be  interested in cohosting such events? Redditors here recommend SU Post and a  particular Facebook group ([https://www.facebook.com/groups/1694899444070553](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1694899444070553)) but these seem more aimed at finding rooms than finding partners in crime
3. Another  opportunity I've been looking into is co-buying a property with other  students. California permits Tenancies-in-Common, which is a legal  arrangement for people to own fractional shares of a property. This way I  won't hemorrhage money to rent during my studies. What would be the  best way to find other students interested in exploring this possibility  with me?
--------------------------------------------------
Anyone else came from Berkeley? I just started my PhD program here and looking for people to connect with. Cool with Foothill college people too!
I did my masters in EECS and undergrad in MCB and EECS back in cal. Worked at UCSF and at Berkeley for several years.
--------------------------------------------------
Coterm Question
Currently exploring a BS+MS in CS as a coterm option. I had a few questions:

1. In order to be considered for graduate billing in the fifth year, do I need to have completed my undergraduate CS degree already? Or can I have a few classes left over from my undergraduate career and take those in my fifth year?

2. Is it possible to take CS classes for the undergraduate degree for less than the maximum units to make room for the 45 coterm units required?
--------------------------------------------------
New Rule Proposal: no unsolicited requests
Hi all! This is something I've been noticing more lately in this sub that I wanted to bring up: non-Stanford students posting asking Stanford students to send them Stanford-only resources like books or syllabi. I completely understand the motivations behind why people ask, but quite frankly, it's annoying, these posts often don't get many, if any, replies, and they take away from the purpose of r/stanford, which is for Stanford students and alums to discuss Stanford stuff. There is often a reason these resources are behind a Stanford firewall, and they should be procured officially through the university.

**What I'd like to propose is a new rule: no unsolicited requests**. This isn't unprecedented (college subs like r/Harvard already have similar rules) and I think it would improve the quality of this space. The wording I'm thinking about (modified from r/Havard's) would be something like: 

"No unwanted or unsolicited requests for library books, course syllabi, or other information that requires a Stanford login. If you are a student at another institution and need access to a Stanford resource, please pursue that through an official route directly with the university."

Would love to hear what other people think (or if it's just me that feels this way haha)
--------------------------------------------------
Drawing I?
I'm planning on taking drawing I for my CE requirement, but I'm a little hesitant to take it virtually. What were your experiences with the class? What kind of materials did yall use?
--------------------------------------------------
Frosh and sophs who are still home, how are you doing?
I feel like I’m the only person I know who’s still living at home going into spring quarter. All my high school friends have been back to school since fall, and at Stanford nearly everyone I know is living together off-campus with friends. My parents are strict and it’s expensive, so that’s just not an option for me and special circumstances is being more stringent about who they let come to campus for the spring. 

I just feel awful and isolated all the time, I don’t even feel human anymore, just a machine that does psets and takes exams (and doesn’t even do well lol) and never sees other humans my age. I can’t take my flex next quarter without losing my stipend for summer research, so I have no choice but to endure another three months of feeling like this, waking up everyday with there being no end in sight and nothing to look forward to. If there’s anyone else who’s still home, how are you coping?
--------------------------------------------------
Stanford anime club?
What it says on the tin. A few campus organization websites say we have one, but all I could find was a link to a broken website and a dead Facebook page. Does anyone know if this club or another one with similar interests is still active? Would love to make some friends to geek out with

How to stay connected with Alumni Network?
Recent grad here, back in school I kept hearing about the amazing alumni network we had, but now that I've graduated and am working a job, I don't really know how to connect back with Stanford. Any thoughts? I already joined some alumni mailing lists for my area, but the alumni group doesn't seem to put on too many virtual events.

Seattle area, if that matters.

Thanks

Classes that strongly influenced your major?
Frosh here, just trying to navigate all the majors at Stanford. Earlier in the year I was pretty set on majoring in Engineering Physics, but after taking CS 106A and really enjoying the class (and not enjoying Physics 41 nearly as much), I'm not as sure. I know that there is a computational science specialty in EPhys, but this would only include three courses from CS. On the other hand, CS 106A is just a small glimpse into CS, so I'm not sure I want to fully jump into it just yet. I plan on taking Physics 43 and CS 106B in the rest of my frosh year to hopefully help my decision-making, but I was just wondering; what are some classes that helped or strongly influenced how some of you declared your majors?
--------------------------------------------------
Are the email-verified Stanford-specific groups still in existence / active? I was a member but cannot seem to find them anymore.

Cs 110 in the summer
Maybe this is a dumb question and it could apply to other courses. So I’m thinking of taking 110 for my flex term and I’m worried that because of the shortened quarter, some of the material will be cut from the class. Is this a valid concern or am I tripping? And does it even matter since any other class I’d take would probably also have shortened material?

Has anyone managed to successfully waive out of cardinal care after being enrolled in it for one quarter?
I'm an international student. I took a Flex quarter during Fall, and I was back home so I waived out of cardinal care. I came to campus for Winter and enrolled in it, but I'm taking a LOA for spring. It seems I can't get out of cardinal care for the rest of the year, but there is no way I can afford it :/ I'm a FLI student and finaid covers medical insurance for me. I would be paying way more just for cardinal care than I would have to pay for tuition.

Has anyone in a similar spot managed to waive out of cardinal care?

BIO vs HUMBIO series
Hi guys, 

Is it possible to take the 2A/3A/4A series only in HUMBIO without the B? I read somewhere that the exam questions do have some crossover. For those of you who took A and B series, did you find that you needed the B part to do well on the A exams ? 

Is the BIO 82/83/84 better than taking the 2A/3A/4A ? Which of these prepares you better for MCAT. 

Thanks so much.

Marking scheme in CS 106B
I'm wondering about the marking scheme in CS 106B for our assignments. We have these rankings, like +, ✓+, ✓, etc. How do these translate into our final letter grades? For example, would getting all ✓+ on assignments be equivalent to getting the grade for an A on assignments?
--------------------------------------------------
CS 107 v 103 vs 109

PWR 1 grading curve

Coterm in 4 Years ?
Has anyone else successfully completed their degree and a coterm program in 4 years ? I’m interested in coterming ( still in my freshman year but I’m planning a little ahead) , and I wanna use my 12 quarters of financial aid to complete a coterm. that’s obviously the only way I could afford to. Any advice on advance planning ? Number of units to take earlier on i.e. number of units to have had completed by end of junior year etc ?
--------------------------------------------------
Masters in management science and engineering not great?
I have heard mostly negative things about the management science and engineering grad program. 

A lot of people are saying it's the "water-down" version of a masters of engineering and MBA. 

Has anyone had a good experience with this program?
--------------------------------------------------
Chess club
Is the Stanford chess club still active? If so, are there any opportunities for beginners to get involved with the club? I’ve been really interested in learning how to play chess, but it has been hard to find people to play with and especially people who could guide me to learn more about it. Any info is appreciated!
--------------------------------------------------
ChemE vs BioE major?
Hello! '24 here thinking about what to major in. As a preface, I plan to go to med-school and work in the life-sciences industry (pharmaceuticals, biotech startups, etc.). Given my interest in life sciences and creating/building things, BioE seemed like the natural choice. However, I've heard lots of mixed opinions on BioE as a major. Many say that it's too broad (and hence you don't really gain that depth of knowledge you should have as an engineering major). Looking at Stanford's undergraduate curriculum for BioE, I kind of see it? There seem to be a few core courses and most of it is random electives (please correct me if I'm seeing it wrong though!). On the other hand, ChemE addresses the fact that my major sub-interest within life-sciences/engineering is cellular/molecular stuff. I'm less interested in imaging technology, biomechanics, etc, and more interested in things like drug development. But, ChemE seems like quite a difficult degree (lots of core courses, etc.) and there looks to be a lot of stuff regarding pure physical chemistry that I'm not really interested in (given that I'm not looking to be a pure "chemical engineer").

Anyone major(ed/ing) in either of these two have any thoughts on these majors? Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------
Difficulty of MS&E minor?
Has anyone on here minored/considered minoring in MS&E? I'm an econ major and would love to talk to someone about their experience in MS&E. I'm worried it might be difficult on top of an econ major.

Remote Music Classes
How do remote music classes work? Are only people on campus able to take them so they can access the instruments? I wasn't able to find any clarifications about this on the music department's website.

How to get people to work on cool ideas with you
Hello, 

I am currently a remote frosh and had a couple questions. An obvious reason why I came to Stanford was to learn from some of the greatest minds on Earth in the classroom, but another major reason was to find people to work on cool things with (like really embrace the Stanford 'culture' you know?). I am not talking about class projects or something. More like some big, bold, and seemingly foolish ideas. I have lots of them myself but I can't feasibly build them all myself and would love to either: help people with their ideas or form a group to build my ideas. 

I don't have much connections with classmates due to being at home this year and I am hoping that once everyone is back, these connections can form fluidly. But in the time being, is there some sort of group, club, community, organization that is Stanford related where I can introduce my ideas and get people to help build them with me? 

To give some more context, some ideas are pretty much entrepreneurship related (i.e. like a startup) others are fun side projects. 

Also important info: I am a CS major so pretty much all projects would revolve primarily around some technology (but there is a lot of non-cs parts involved with some as well). I also got rejected from the two primary entrepreneurship club programs in the fall if that helps. 

Feel free to drop any advice you may have :) 

Anything is greatly appreciated. 

Thanks!

Haircut Places for Women
Does anyone know any good haircut places for women around Stanford/Palo Alto that aren't too expensive? Most of the places I've found are barbershops and don't do women's haircuts.

How close will Stanford be to the “old normal” this Autumn?
I know nobody can predict the future, so the best we can do is give educated guesses on how the university will operate based on a projected 60-80% vaccination rate. I’m an incoming student so I don’t have any experience with how Stanford has handled COVID so far.

Obviously Stanford has to adhere to State and County regulations, but if given favorable COVID conditions (70+% vaccination rate and low case numbers), would the school try to return things to normal a bit?

For comparison UT Austin has set 80% vaccination rate as a requirement before things start to look normal again. I haven’t seen Stanford say something similar so that’s why I’m asking.

Stanford claims it “Doesn’t have the resources” to provide for its disabled students. A multi-BILLION dollar institution.

Is an Honors Thesis worth if you're not considering grad school?
Hi all,

Currently a junior on a gap year considering their remaining two years at Stanford. I wanted to gauge the sub's thoughts on completing an Honors Thesis during your senior year if grad school is not in your future plans.

Personally, I feel I've spoken with more people than not who have regretted doing their honors thesis, or at least felt it was a waste of time. Just to quickly consider what you might give up to write an honors thesis:

1. Time you could spend taking interesting classes
2. Time you could spend working on cool projects
3. Time you could spend on general self-care or self-development
4. Since all Honors Programs require your presence on-campus all three quarters, you lose the opportunity to go abroad if you haven't already
5. Time you could spend simply hanging out with your friends during your final year

Is there something that I'm missing? Why does it seem that so many students who aren't going to grad school, and who don't have a burning passion for their thesis topic, seem to apply for the Honors Programs anyways? Is there some benefit to have an Honors on your degree or resume that I'm not seeing?

Any and all thoughts would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!

physiotherapist at Stanford
Hey everybody. Incoming PhD student here with a disability (you'll see me a lot around this sub lol). 

I was wondering if there is any physiotherapist on main campus and if the cost is covered by Stanford health insurance. I've looked up the website and if I understand correctly, there is a clinic in Redwood. However, I don't have a car and I would need to uber to the place - which becomes expensive in the long run (anyone knows how expensive is uber?) especially if the visit is not covered by health insurance.

Thank you!

is cs229 still being offered in the summer

EE104 or CS229?
I’m not sure what the difference is between Introduction to Machine Learning (EE104) and Machine Learning (CS229) since EE104 has more prereqs (ENGR 108 is one). Could someone help me decide between them? I only know linear algebra up to a MATH 51 level, haven’t taken ENGR 108, but not sure how necessary it is. Any advice helps.
--------------------------------------------------
What to take after Math 52
Hi! I took Math 51 and Math 52 so far, but am not sure if I should take Math 53 or something else. Is Math 53 a prerequisite for any important classes later on? Or would some other class be more useful?

For reference, I'm interested in CS especially graphics, and might dabble a bit in AI just to try it out, though still not entirely sure yet so am open to possibility of changing things around. Will most likely be doing engineering for sure though at least.

So far have done CS106B and am thinking of taking CS 107 next. If there are any other course suggestions I'd appreciate them too! For classes like CS103 and CS109 I'm not sure either what order or combinations of classes would be best to take them.

Thanks!

CS124, CS111, CS230, ECON46
Hi guys,

I've signed up for these courses for spring quarter and know that CS111 will definitely be a lot of work. My thought is that CS124, CS230, and ECON46 will be lighter. However, I don't really know many people who have taken those courses (especially 124 and 130), so I was wondering if any students who have taken these courses could weigh in on this schedule and let me know if it's reasonable. I kind of figured that CS230 and ECON46 could be crammed in in a day's worth of work per week and CS124 maybe in 2 days and CS111 in the other 3 or 4 days (would be nice to have 1 chill day per week but I don't really go out due to COVID anyways). Thank you for any advice!

What’s it like being Black at Stanford?
Hi, I’m a prefrosh and I’ve heard there is subtle racism from the surrounding area (from rich, predominantly White/Asian people) and not-so-subtle racism when it comes to campus security and policing in Palo Alto. I’d love to hear the experiences of others (please only if you are Black). Also I know of Ujamaa. I’m not asking about opportunities to connect w other Black students, I’m asking specifically about instances of racism, micro aggressions, etc. and how frequently they happen.

If you do well in SCPD Comp Sci courses, can you get a letter of recommendation/access to research opportunities?
I'm looking to improve my profile for grad school apps next cycle, and I was thinking of taking some of the CS courses offered through SCPD. This would all be remotely. 

Can anyone with experience tell me whether it's possible for a SCPD student to get a letter of recommendation from a professor if they do well, or access to research experience, or something? Like would I have the same option as a degree seeking Stanford student to stand out, build a relationship with the professor, and so on? Or with SCPD students is it more a case of 'we take your money and teach you stuff' without that level of depth?

Thanks!

Taking Chem 33 with an REU in the summer?
[EDIT] I had initially put Chem 33 but it looks like it likely won’t be offered in the summer so if I took CME 100 or Physics 41 with an REU would it be viable?

Does anyone have any experience doing this and if this is a manageable thing to do? I really don’t want to take 33 in the spring because I plan to take CME 100, physics 41, and ENGR 50. Any advice is very much appreciated!

Do you think that the pre COVID students will look down on us who didn’t have to submit SAT scores?
So I’m currently on a gap year and I’m supposed to start my undergrad in statistics this fall. But I’m not sure how the reception will be. I’m kinda scared that professors and maybe even some older students might treat us like badly. I really don’t want the stigma of getting a easy ride into Stanford because of the pandemic to be hanging over my head. Should this be something I should be potentially be worried about?

Math 51 for Summer Session
I'm in 11th grade and am doing the Stanford Summer Session in a few months. 

I'm debating between taking either Math 19 or 51 (also Math is my strongest subject at school) along with maybe STATS 60. I'm pretty sure Math 19 is introductory calculus, which I'm already doing in school, and I'm not sure if taking the course is worth it. I was planning on taking AI in the future so Math 51 seemed like a good option (it says on the site that Math 51 provides the math needed for CS 229). The problem with that is I don't have much time before summer to spend on working through whichever prereqs are necessary. I've also seen posts of freshman complaining about the course's difficulty. I don't really want to be stressing too hard in summer over the course. 

Is it realistic to take Math 51, if I have only a high school level of calculus? 

Thanks in advance!
