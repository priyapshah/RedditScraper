Most relevant probability course for ML
Hello friends at MIT. I'm an EECS student at the University of Michigan, and I will be taking machine learning next semester. However, my background in probability is a little weak (slightly better than AP Stats level) and I'm trying to fix that over the summer by just going through an MIT OCW course. However, I found 3-4 different probability/random processes/statistics courses and was wondering which one you guys suggest as a pre-req to ML?

It seems to me from my research that 6.041 Introduction to Probability would make sense since it is offered by your EECS department and covers things I'd expect I'll need like multivariate distributions, joint/marginal/conditional probability, Bayes Rule, etc. [https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-6-012-introduction-to-probability-spring-2018/index.htm](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-6-012-introduction-to-probability-spring-2018/index.htm). Does this one seem right or is there something else you guys usually take? Thanks!

p.s. I hope this sub is the right place for this post, if not, mods please feel free to remove it and I will ask elsewhere

Still Waiting for Fall 2021 Transfer Decision
Has anyone gotten their admission result yet for 2021 fall transfer application? I'm stil waiting for mine, waited through 1:59 pm, 3:14 pm, and don't know what other time should i be looking for.

Regret over choosing a school over MIT. Should I bother applying for transfer?
I chose a school in my country (top 20 in the world), over MIT, after being given a very generous scholarship and admission to an elite accelerated programme for the first year. But owing to Covid, the second half of the programme collapsed and I feel that I've lost an insane amount of value. I always thought I could go to MIT for PhD so the decision was not very difficult - plus MIT was going to be thrice as expensive.

I'd like to transfer back. I'll be entering as a junior because I missed this transfer cycle. How do I convey a.) that I'd been accepted earlier, b.) I regret that decision and c.) that I would thrive as an MIT student.

I don't think stats should be an issue, I've taken third year math/physics courses as a freshman, so I think I can demonstrate that I'm good with course rigour.

Can Snapchat Sustain a Friendship? [Anonymous Survey]
Hello /r/mit! I am an undergraduate student at the University of Washington in Seattle and I‚Äôm running a study on how the use of the social media app Snapchat is influencing feelings of connection within friendships during the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, I‚Äôm looking to recruit college students from around the country who use Snapchat to take **a short, 15 minute, anonymous survey** about their experiences thus far in the pandemic in regard to how connected they are feeling to their friends.

Is It Possible to transfer during Spring of your Sophomore year?

Physics Question
How do you solve such questions in one go, or at least without any help.

Question is:  In order to minimize the effects of corrosion, the platinum-iridium prototype kilogram is a right cylinder with dimensions chosen to minimize the surface area for a given fixed volume. The standard kilogram is an alloy of 90 % platinum and 10 % iridium. The density of the alloy is œÅ = 21.56 g ‚ãÖ cm‚àí3 . Based on this information, (i) determine the radius of the prototype kilogram, and (ii) the ratio of the radius to the height.

I need someone from the MIT to provide a talk to my high school. (Preferably an international student).
By June of 2021, I will be applying to the student council for the period 2021-2022. I want that one of my proposals would be to have some sort of talk given by a professor or student from this university. This talk could not only offer admission information of MIT and USA universities in general, but also his/her experience in the American Education System. It¬¥s preferably for the student/professor to be international, because logically it¬¥s not the same applying as a national and my high school is located in Venezuela. The talk would be through Microsoft Teams and for terms of schedule it can¬¥t last longer than 45 minutes. I¬¥m sure that my school will love and appreciate this initiative because a lot of them are aiming for USA universities, but don¬¥t know too much about their admissions process, so it would be great if some of you are interested in giving this talk. Also, if you know someone interested but isn¬¥t joined to this subreddit, you may give this information. Thanks!

How realistic is the idea of double majoring?
Hi! Pre-frosh here :)

failing a GIR? (18.02)
tdlr: failing 18.02 after dropping 18.02A last semester, and struggling to focus off campus

So, I‚Äôm a freshman living off campus this spring, and I‚Äôve had a very hard time concentrating on studying and watching recorded lectures and stuff. It‚Äôs awful cuz I doing horribly in all my classes and just getting more and more behind and now it‚Äôs past halfway through the semester and I‚Äôm burnt out af. In fall, I dropped 18.02A because I got so so behind in that too, and tried to try again with 18.02 in this spring, but definitely effed that up. I even dropped 6.042 this spring to try to help (cuz ofc I was behind in that) but nothing changed. I think I‚Äôll be able to do better when I‚Äôm on campus this fall? but I just don‚Äôt know what to do, failing the same class twice, and a GIR at that. feels like I‚Äôm not cut out of MIT, even tho I love the people and the club I‚Äôm in and my other classes. any advice? feels like i‚Äôve asked too much from my s3 dean too

MIT Parking in General
I am an incoming graduate student in the fall, and am looking at on-campus housing (already signed up for the housing lottery üëçüèª), but was curious about the availability of parking. 

I figured I won‚Äôt be driving a lot, but I think I still want to bring my vehicle up there. I saw some pricing on MIT parking passes, but they seem expensive. 

Is that normal pricing for the Boston/Cambridge area, and if I paid for the pass, would there even be spots available? Is there cheaper options for parking elsewhere? 

Also, if I switch to off-campus housing, I would probably find more options for parking, but I am not sure where to look. Any recommendations?

Value on the east coast
I‚Äôm currently a high school senior that‚Äôs undecided between MIT and Stanford. As a hopeful CS major, I know that the academics are equivalent at both schools. After graduating college, I would like to return back to the east coast ‚Äî preferable somewhere in the southeast as that‚Äôs where my family is. I‚Äôm wondering the value of an MIT degree over a Stanford degree on the east coast. I know this probably varies per person. I‚Äôve heard that not as many Stanford students move to the east, so that may be a signal. Would you say MIT has the lead in this case? I would appreciate any insight!

I‚Äôm deciding between both and I feel like this is probably one of my bigger worries (I‚Äôm struggling to see myself at one over the other) Thank you!

Prefrosh asking about Course 6-14
Hello, prefrosh here.

Can someone in Course 6-14 talk about their experiences with the major?

How‚Äôs the workload compare to other CS majors? How many students actually end up majoring in it? 

Thanks for your time :)

Can I learn coding in MIT, or do I need to learn coding myself, since the secondary schools I've went to haven't really been able to teach me?
I want to go to MIT for software and robotics, and I've tried to learn coding, robotics, and engineering in school. I'm currently exiting middle school and going into high school. In middle school, I've tried to take as many courses as I can, but it hasn't really worked out. In sixth grade, I learned coding in Swift and learned robotics with legos, but I couldn't get into the robotics club because it was women-only. In seventh grade, instead of me getting into robotics 2 or engineering (engineering is seventh and eighth grade, and I don't think there's a coding 2), but instead I was just put back into coding 1, so I just did the course a bit quicker and did some Swift graphic design. I was able to get into that year's robotics club, but it only lasted a few weeks until Covid came. I then did Java graphic design at home. In eighth grade, every single robotics, coding, and engineering related activities have been cancelled due to Covid. The high school I plan on going to seems to have no robotics, coding, or engineering activities available. Should I try learning to code on Codecademy, or are there any other options?

Networking and Business Students During COVID-19 Research Study Survey
I hate to reach out in this manner, especially as not everyone studies something business-related, but I'm working on a research project where I am sending out a survey to undergrad students in business-related majors/fields. Particularly, I want to measure how the experience with professional networking before and during COVID-19 changed the perceptions of undergraduate business-related students on their field.¬† 

I have sent out this survey to countless of emails and received minimal response. Would it be possible for any of you to take or send out this survey? If you could, that would be awesome! :-) 

[Take the survey here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1XF8MwAQHYBKW-auEMfMYJuWycPpzN_ZZl1eIW22RZds/edit) 

The procedure involves filling an online survey that will take no more than 10 minutes. All information will be kept confidential, and the surveys will not contain information that will personally identify someone. If you have any questions, comments, and/or concerns about the research study, please DM me or contact me at [networking021@gmail.com](mailto:networking021@gmail.com).¬† 

Thank you!

How is 6.047/6.878 (Computational Biology)?
Hi, r/MIT. I'm a harvard grad student interested in cross-registering into 6.047/6.878 with Manolis next year, but it seems that as a non-MIT student, it's impossible to find any student reviews about the course. I know what kind of content is presented in the course since a lot of material is publicly available online, but I'm completely unfamiliar with what the actual course experience is like. I do not have access to any MIT course evaluations/reviews, so was wondering if anyone could give me any idea on what this course is like? Is it interesting, difficult, worthwhile? etc. 

Thanks!

Questions about cook-for-yourself forms
Hi, I'm a prefrosh looking for some insight into the cook-for-yourself dorms. I'm mainly interested in New House and MacGregor right now, mostly because the i3 videos seemed fun. I'm a pretty social person and would like to attend social events/get to know people well. I also like cooking!

If anyone can tell me more about the cultures, pros/cons of each dorm (or others) that would be really great! 

Some other specific questions I have are: is air conditioning necessary? are New House kitchens/bathrooms crowded at all? since MacGregor has carpeted rooms, does it tend to get dusty? is it true that you'll be less motivated if you live in a single as a freshman? what's the kitchen/refrigerator space situation like at each dorm?

please feel free to share any and all other info/advice with me about cook-for-yourself dorms! thanks :)

Dell XPS 15 vs Surface Laptop 4

So I need help - which would you recommend between the Dell XPS 15 (touch or non-touch idm) VS Surface Laptop 4 - which would be better for an Electrical/Computer Engineering student?

I might want to game a bit occasionally (very light gaming though), watch Netflix etc.

All help greatly appreciated!

MIT: any unique activities you‚Äôd like to pursue with community?
Especially, I‚Äôm curious because I am helping to make a community startup here in Boston where people can seriously unwind and get into the flow with interesting, play-based activities. It‚Äôs so much fun! I‚Äôm personally really into this because of the social life and easy socializing through activities component. And especially would like to see if the community here is into it. 

Feel free to message me privately about this! And, sharing two upcoming events ‚Äî feel free to check them out. If you‚Äôd like more information, please comment or DM me, your feedback on this group is as appreciated as potential participation. Do note we created a signup for our site and events~

For example:

BS Business Analytics Major Info
Hello - there is almost no first-hand info (other than the mit website) abt the sloan ugrad business analytics major - it seems very tech heavy (more so than other similar MIS programs) but its only 60 sem credits. any reviews? is it a good major in terms of salary and jobs? how does it compare to bs mgmt or cs, econ, and dat sci? thx and any info appreciated!

Dorm Culture
I‚Äôm an upcoming freshman and have no idea which dorms to rank, so I‚Äôm hoping you guys can give me more insight than I could find on the dorm websites.

I‚Äôm a very social person and want to live in a dorm where there are lots of activities and opportunities to socialize.

I don‚Äôt want a place that is deemed too ‚Äúquirky‚Äù; I would rather live somewhere pretty conventional.

Are there specific dorms I should avoid, or will most dorms offer me the same experience no matter what?

student bands?
Admitted student here. I'm wondering if there are a lot of student rock/indie/folk/etc bands or groups, and how easy it is to find people to start one at MIT. I know MIT has an abundance of classical music, but is there a much of a hip/artsy scene for rock bands or songwriters? Is it inviting for people not already virtuosos at their instruments? Are there chill people just wanting to be creative with music in a way that's not competitive/pretentious?

Also, do you know how this might compare to the scene at Brown or Yale or Wesleyan? (hehe trying to decide lol)

Any insight would be very much appreciated. Thank you so much.

Which streets/areas are fun when we're not in the middle of a pandemic?
Now that the world is re-opening, I'm hoping to move close to campus in the fall and live in a fun area. What are the more social or happening areas/streets where people from MIT spend time? E.g. I see some really nice appartments near Harvard Square but I'm guessing MIT grad students tend to hang out closer to campus.

Choosing between Harvard + MIT + Stanford - Either course 1 or 6 w minor in public policy
Hello!

I‚Äôve been really lucky to have been accepted to these three schools, but I‚Äôm torn because they‚Äôre all great in their own way. I‚Äôm leaning towards going to Boston since Stanford seems to be in a very rich bubble. I‚Äôm low income and first gen so I‚Äôm a bit worried about that. 
I‚Äôm interested in either going into industry and working as a software developer or working with Google, or working with non-profits to develop devices for developing countries (I‚Äôm a bit undecided and all over the place). I love math and science, but I‚Äôm also interested in history.

I like MIT a lot, but I‚Äôm scared I won‚Äôt develop the soft skills I need in life in case I want to move up in the business world or in the world of non-profits. In addition, I‚Äôve spent the majority of my high school just studying. I am a hard worker, some even say a workaholic, but I would like a more or less balanced college experience where I know I can find friends to have fun with, go into the city, shop, eat food, have silly conversations with. 

I‚Äôm extroverted compared to introverts but quite introverted around extroverts.
Besides that, I live in the south so I‚Äôm a bit afraid of the cold although looking for something new and exciting. 

I have visited Harvard and mit and love both their campuses but haven‚Äôt visited stanford. 
I am also not totally sure if I‚Äôll go through with engineering.

Any thoughts?

Edit: took out that I wanted to work for NASA bc I like astrophysics research,, not building rockets and such haha

Graduate Housing - Roommate Assignment Process
I was wondering how the roommate assignment process works in the graduate dorms. I don't really know any other incoming graduate students that well, and I also don't know anyone that is actually looking for a roommate. I have never lived with a complete stranger before, and even though I am willing to give this a try, I would like to at least know the other person has similar habits in terms of sleep, cleanliness, quiet times etc. So I was wondering, how does the roommate assignment process work if I choose a two-bedroom apartment but have no potential roommate? Do I fill in some questionnaire about my habits? Do I get to talk to my roommate before we move in together?

Double Major in 6-1 (or 6-2) and 14-2
Hi,

I'm a class of 25 and I applied to MIT intent on doing 6-1 or 6-2, but after doing some good thinking and learning about MIT's economics department, I think I want to double major in 14-1 or 14-2 with a focus on development economics, something I've been into for a long long time. 

I can't do 6-14, since my parents want me to get a degree in 6-1 or 6-2, and I also wanted to focus more on EE which 6-14 doesn't do. 

my question is, Is it possible to double major in say, 6-1 and 14-2? If not, what would the best possible alternative be? 

My goals are to go to grad school in economics or engineering and doing a ton of research at MIT.
--------------------------------------------------
Laptops? MacBook Pro VS Surface

MIT vs Harvard (math + econ)
Hi! I was accepted into both MIT and Harvard for the Regular Decision cycle and I really don't know how to choose. I am interested in math and econ mostly, and in the future I'm hoping to go to grad school and possibly get involved in economic policy. Is there one school that has an advantage in this case? I also want to enjoy myself in college, though, so I'd love to hear some tips about social scene/extracurriculars/etc. Would appreciate any tips or ideas at all.

What‚Äôs Grad Student Life Like? (Accepted off waitlist yesterday)
I was accepted off the waitlist for a PhD literally yesterday (yikes) and given until Monday to respond. Didn‚Äôt do much research on living around here because I didn‚Äôt want to look around and then not get in.

So I just wanted to probe around for some opinion on what the general culture is around MIT. I expect that the students work very hard, but is it possible to set boundaries and obtain a healthy work/life balance? I‚Äôll most likely be working in a lab that broadly includes Mechanical Engineering or Electrical Engineering (I know, being real specific here)

Is it possible for me to find housing if I start looking right now?  What if I want to live with my partner, who has only just started to look for engineering jobs in Cambridge/Boston?

computational biology major!
As someone who wants to major in computational biology I am scared that I will not do well in my cs classes because I know a lot of kids who go into MIT r master coders already. Is there enough assistance for beginners and is there any online classes anyone recommends I take over the summer to maybe prepare. Thank you!

Bus Number One Service
Hi! How is the service for Bus Number One between Harvard and MIT? I saw that there is one every 10 minutes; is this the case throughout the year, even during winter? How reliable is it? Also, if you're working late at the university, how late does the bus run/is it pretty safe? Thanks!

Pure vs Applied vs General vs Math with CS
I think I'm more into pure math but I'm afraid of not finding a job after graduation. I don't mind working in the academia, and I plan on having a phd in math.
Any advice?

Reasons for choosing MIT CS over Harvard CS (besides rigorous technical foundation!)
Currently debating between the two schools. I'm extremely interested in entrepreneurship/tech.

I know I will get an extremely rigorous and solid technical education, but I was curious whether the soft skills/business/startup aspect of MIT are there as well. What are some things that make the MIT CS program special?

MIT Financial Aid Appeal
My family comes from the upper-middle, and while we would be able to pay the full price of tuition, it is rather difficult. Unfortunately, my letter said that I am not eligible for need-based aid. I'm planning on appealing, and I was wondering if anyone else could share their experiences. How much can I reasonably expect to receive from an appeal? Aside from writing a letter and setting up an appointment to explain my situation, is there anything else I can do? 

For more context, I'm an international student, and I wasn't able to fill out the FAFSA. Also, I have received offers from other colleges that award need-based aid, but I haven't received anything.

[Beautiful Picture of Oryol](https://preview.redd.it/qznxgr8tfos61.png?width=284&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad93c9c8689e48d41adfd3cbec1deb8925609b2)

Guys, I feel like the luckiest son of a gun alive. Got admitted to Grad School here recently. I grew up in Oryol, Russia - a medium-ish city with a population near that of Iceland's. But it doesn't have even a tenth of a ring of "Moscow" or "St. Petersburg", so for all intents and purposes, it's as famous as a random village. I went to an ordinary HS, nothing fancy, and then moved to the US. The rest is history.

What not-so-very-famous place have you grown up in, and which country? Share your story!

Prefrosh ASE Questions
Hi, I'll either major in 6-1 or 6-2 and am taking the BC Calc and  AP Physics C: Mechanics tests and I'm fairly sure I'll get 5s on both of them.  If i want to skip over 18.01 and  8.01 do I need to take ASEs or will the AP credit be enough? Also, I know Python pretty well and am taking AP CS, so would it be a good idea to try to test out of 6.0001? Lastly, I was wondering if it would make sense to try to self study 8.02 and test out of it. I know this is a core class EE, so I'm thinking it could be a bad idea to cram the material. I have to graduate in 7 semesters BTW. 

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance

What MacBook Should I Get - CS Major
I'm an incoming freshman, who is thinking of studying Course 6-3, 6-9, or 6-14. I've used a MacBook throughout high school, so I think I'll stick with that. Does anyone have any recommendations on MacBook Pro vs. MacBook Air? And how much storage I'll need?

How to negotiate for lower costs and more financial aid as an admit?
Hey, I was incredibly fortunate to be admitted here, but another school offered half the cost of attendance for me. I know some schools like Columbia encourage you to share other schools‚Äô packages with them if others are more generous, but is that the case for MIT? I appreciate any help offered! Thanks!

Graduate housing options...
Hey there, I‚Äôm an incoming graduate student and want to get more insight on housing. I‚Äôm coming from the west coast, so not a ton of experience with the snowy winters and such. I‚Äôll be making the move alone, so I won‚Äôt know anyone. Given this, I‚Äôm leaning towards graduate housing. Any thoughts/insights are appreciated!
--------------------------------------------------
MIT vs. Harvard vs. Stanford?
Hi guys, I recently got all my decisions back, and I was incredibly fortunate to get to choose between MIT, Harvard, and Stanford. I‚Äôm looking to major in math/physics and I have some interest in CS + Econ. I‚Äôm trying to attend the admitted students events, but I‚Äôm still pretty undecided (unfortunately, I haven't had the chance to visit any of the campuses in real life). Location is not a large concern for me, and cost is roughly the same across all schools. Any thoughts on what school would be better for undergrad would be appreciated!

Edit: Sorry if my question seems a bit vague, I'd prefer if I could DM people who are available to talk about specifics, thanks!

Dorm Questions
Hi! Trying to decide on dorms for the fall...does anyone know if Simmons or Next House have (shared) kitchens on each floor/lounge even though they're meal plan-required? Do these have cooking ranges, or just fridges/microwaves? 

Also, I have pretty severe allergies and want to cook for myself. I am considering Macgregor but also other options (hence the above questions). Is it possible to get off the required meal plan at these other places if you have severe allergies?

Thanks in advance!

How closed is campus?
Im sorry if this is an annoying question but i was just admitted to the class of 25 and i wanted to visit campus!
I understand there are no tours and i obviously wouldn‚Äôt go inside the buildings but are visitors allowed to park nearby and walk around the campus? Like it would just be me alone walking around outside. Or is the campus like keycard protected?
Thank you!

Concurrent Master's -- Is it common at all?
What does it take to achieve a concurrent Master's? Can it be managed by an average student?

I've been admitted and will most likely attend MIT after taking a gap year or two. Given that I'll be 19 or 20 when I start, the prospect of a concurrent master's is important to me.
--------------------------------------------------
How do stipends work?
This is probably a stupid question, but I want to make sure I understand how stipends work before I enter a PhD program at MIT. I was offered a $3086/mo stipend and the letter said "you can expect full financial support." I'm sure this will be enough to cover living costs (i.e. rent, groceries, etc.) based on my financial experiences as an MIT undergrad. However, I'll still need to take out student loans to cover tuition, right? Tuition is listed in the letter as $53,450/year = $4454/mo, so it seems like even if I have some stipend money left over to contribute toward tuition, I'll still need to cover the gap with loans. Is that how it generally works?
--------------------------------------------------
When campus might open back up?
I'm an alum who just moved back to the area. I expect MIT will probably be closed to non-students through the end of spring term, but is there any talk of when that might change? Are people hearing it might change in summer or is fall looking more likely? I'm asking because I really look forward to going to mit related events like talks/lectures and joining the z center.

I hope all the current students are having the best possible term under the tough circumstances. Happy vaccinations to you all!

Got into the EECS PhD Program, but not sure if I can handle it
Alright folks, I need some genuine opinions and suggestions here. I am so terrified of making a right decision. I am an undergrad at a rather "laid back" college. Sure, I have what the say good grades but I am 10 steps behind the effortless genius people I have met so far in the program. I do not have much research/ hands on experience on the field I am interested in, I even have some lacking in the concepts. To put simply, I am overly underprepared both academically and in experience. I have to spend a lot of time just for understanding a simple concept, but I can work hard. Advisors and students said the key to success is being a quick learner, which I am definitely not.

I am not even 100% certain what I want to do. I kind of know the topic that fascinates me, but that's just from taking 3 courses on it, there might be chances that I do not end up enjoying the actual research on it. There are two potential advisors I am talking to, one who does exactly what I think I want to do ( say Mr. A). There's another prof who does research on a different, but slightly close to my interest (say Mr. B). Now life would be so much easier if Mr. A was a mentor with the qualities that I am looking for. Mr A is quite judgemental, demanding, pushy; his students work more than average. Even though I haven't heard of any reason that I should NOT be working with him, I am someone who needs constant confidence, support, and inspiration from my mentor to do well. Now coming to Mr. B, he seems like an amazing person, and mentor. He does good work too, so he's definitely not laid back, but is more liberal.

Now I am very confused on who I should pick. Should I go for the field I enjoy with a little less than okay advisor or should I go with an extremely supportive advisor who doesn't do exactly what I want to do. I know I don't have to pick someone right now, and I have the option to go there and find someone, but my current school mentor advise me to start working from day 1 and not being lost around. Also I am struggling with the fact if I will be able to succeed at MIT. I want a master's for now, then I will think about getting a PhD. From the things I have experienced in the visit days, and heard from people, looks like MIT is a place I would like to be. They are collaborative, passionate, and encourage hard work. So, even if I think I am way behind the other MIT folks, I am gonna give it a shot.
--------------------------------------------------
Question about Course 6-9
Hey there. I'm currently a Junior in high school but since senior year is really close, I've been starting to think a lot about college.

I've begun to become more and more interested in artificial intelligence and theoretical neuroscience, so I researched which majors in various schools focus on these kinds of topics. From my research, it seems that MIT's course 6-9 provides a good major for computational neuroscience, but I'm not absolutely sure if it would match my interests well.

At this point, I think I should say that I don't expect to be admitted to MIT at all, but I just want to get a good idea of what these schools have to offer so I can make an informed choice when applying early to any one of them.

That being said, here are my questions:

1.) Is MIT's course 6-9 a good track for careers in AI?
2.) How would the comp sci and cognitive sciences tracks compare to 6-9?
3.) Would there be a significant difference in education between MIT and other universities in this particular field?
4.) What kinds of career opportunities do students have when majoring in 6-9?
5.) Would focusing on neuroscience or computer science be better for AI research?

Sorry if these questions are stupid. Thanks for taking the time to read all of this if you got this far!

How is Course 9
Hello MITers, '25 adMIT here. I'm leaning towards course 9 (Brain and Cog-Sci) for my major, but I have a couple questions that I hope current students or alumni can answer:

1. How good or prestigious is this department at MIT? Is it comparable to similar programs at other universities like Harvard, Stanford, or Johns Hopkins? I noticed that the selection of courses is slightly more limited compared to other universities and more focused on computing.
2. What is the professional outlook for course 9?  What kinds of internships careers have students gone into? How easy is it to land internships during MIT or positions right out of MIT? What is the salary like?

I would really appreciate whatever advice or experience you can offer, cause I can't really find anything elsewhere. Thanks in advance!

What percentile of MIT cs students generally make it to FAANG?
From the rigor of the curriculum + prestige + network, I'd always think mit kids can have the option to work at faang if they want to. I know that many dont cus they decided to go for something different (ie startups/phd). But if you had to guess, what percentile of the people are good enough to make it into faang (maybe lets exclude amazon due to its hire fast fire fast culture)?

MIT course 20 (biological engineering) + BME minor, or BME major at Johns Hopkins?
Hello, all! I recently got accepted into MIT and Johns Hopkins (undergrad), and I am trying to decide which to attend. I am aware that Hopkins BME is the number 1 undergrad BME program in the U.S., but I am not a fan of the location, as it‚Äôs a little too close to home for me.

For MIT, the major is a little different than I was hoping for (a bit broader than BME), but I can minor in biomed engineering to get that specificity I wanted. I‚Äôm also a huge fan of this location and environment, and since I intend to possible double major in comp sci, MIT would definitely be excellent for that. 

I guess what I‚Äôm wondering is, if I go to MIT and major in biological engineering with a minor in biomed engineering, will I be any worse off than if I go to JHU and major in BME? Since the major is presented differently at MIT, I just want to know if I‚Äôll be a disadvantage or not (although I know they are both excellent schools and programs). If anyone in course 20 (or any other course for that matter) has any input, that would be wonderful :)

Thank you in advance for your help!

Question about Tony Stark - MIT's greatest (fictional) alumnus
So, what does Marvel claim he majored in? I've looked online and it appears he majored in Engineering and Physics (Electrical Engineering to be specific). But even Marvel changes up their story between the movies and comics, but usually revolves around the theme of Engineering.

Now, to be Tony Stark, in terms of building the suit and Jarvis all that, what major would someone need? Electrical Engineering? I was thinking Electrical/Mechanical Engineering, maybe EECS? It's probably got to be more than two majors, but if you had to just choose two majors to become as close as possible to Tony Stark, which would you choose and why?

&#x200B;

Disclaimer: I don't want to be Tony Stark, rather I'm prob just gonna do Computational Mathematics in MIT or CMU (still deciding cuz I'm a high school senior), but I'm just really curious :)

MIT Open Study/Work Areas
So when you look at other college campuses it seems as if all of its buildings have large open spaces for students to sit and do work. I know the best example of this is Stata but is there anywhere else on campus that has that similar setup? Like after covid is over are most people just working in the libraries and lounges for their major? Just curious

MIT Confessions is dying. The censorship has gotten out of control.
Title sums it up. Every generation of MIT students in the internet era has had some version of confessions. Every single site like this, at some point, eventually comes to an end. This is what is currently happening to Confessions. It has gone to complete shit. 3-4 years ago, you could post all kinds of funny, interesting, (and yes, inflammatory) bullshit and 1000s of people could enjoy your posts. These days, the admins censor literally anything that goes against their agenda. Can't post a damn thing criticizing the institute (unless of course it's some woke screed about how women and POCs and LGBT people are being microaggressed or something, then it's totally fine). In the past at least people could anonymously post dissenting opinions even if the commenters would always counter with whatever the politically correct angle on the issue was. Can we be real for a second? Internet trolling and insensitive memes DO NOT cause the kind of harm that the activist types think they do. It's all just jokes and shit. RIP confessions.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: Why no current student moderators?
It seems like most of the moderators on this sub-reddit have graduated many years ago and they don't seem to interact with this sub as a whole. 
I see them remove post from time to time but they seem to be ghostly figures in the background. It kind of feels like a  gerontocracy.

I don't hate the moderators on this sub at all I'm just curious why the mod team is not more diverse.

Core/gen ed questions
Hey everyone! I recently was admitted to co25, and I‚Äôm trying to figure out what sorts of things I want to pursue at MIT. I happen to have a few transfer credits that would basically make it so I didn‚Äôt have to take any freshman math (or diff eq), half of freshman physics, or freshman bio. Basically I‚Äôd only take chem freshman year (I‚Äôve been told to take the entry exam because I‚Äôve done most of the material but I really like chem and want to take it again so I don‚Äôt think I will).

Basically my question is if I should take the credits. I understand the material I‚Äôd be skipping, but part of why I want to go to MIT is to really fundamentally understand this stuff. MIT math and physics sounds SO fun!! Plus, I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm not prepared to dive into higher-level courses specifically at MIT, especially during freshman year.

The reasons I might not retake the classes are:

1) I don‚Äôt want to be bored :/ even if the material is more in depth I don‚Äôt think taking a class where I wouldn‚Äôt even learn something new in every lecture would be super enjoyable
2) if I take the credits then I‚Äôd be able to do my double major (CS+BioE) with only 48 credits/term in four years (with two 60-credit terms). This would hopefully make the advanced work more manageable, and it would give me time to do the other things I love. If I re-took the classes, I would probably major in 6-9, but for reasons that would make this post too long, I much prefer the double major.

What do you guys think? Is the MIT core worth the extra work and/or lack of second major? How much time to people tend to spend on work per week as a single major vs a double major? Is the core fun? Do you think it prepared you for your later science classes better than an equivalent course at CC or another school would?

PS I‚Äôd love it if you‚Äôd tell me anything y‚Äôall like about MIT (especially as it relates to CS/BioE) so I can convince my parents to let me move across the country :))
--------------------------------------------------
Stay at MIT?
I'm a senior at MIT and was admitted to the graduate school in my department a few weeks ago. While I like the department here, and it's my top choice, I'm worried that by choosing to go to graduate school here I'm preventing myself from learning more about life outside the "MIT bubble". After I finish a PhD, I will have spent 10 years at this school without ever seeing what other departments are like.

Does anyone have experience or advice that can speak to this?
--------------------------------------------------
Course 16 or Course 2?
Hi everyone, 

I'm a '25 incoming freshman and I'm looking for some advice from current students and/or graduates. For years, I've talked about majoring in Aerospace Engineering as I'm a pilot and have a passion for aviation. However, it seems the more that I look, there are more mechanical engineers in the positions that interest me in aerospace companies. I also like the flexibility of course 2 if, for example, I want to work at a non-aerospace company or pursue other opportunities in engineering.  


I'm thinking now that I want to major in Course 2 with a *focus* in AeroAstro. Does that seem like a logical conclusion, and what advice can current students offer? At the end of the day, will the difference matter?

On a separate note, I'm considering a minor in business or a minor in computer science. How should I make that decision? 

Thanks in advance for your insight and assistance.

Feasibility of 6-3 + 18 major and minor in 15-3
Hey! I was adMITted to the class of '25 and couldn't be more excited. My question is basically the title. Are there any current students who are doing the above combo of courses? Is there any advice you'd give pertaining to this or becoming a quant trader?
--------------------------------------------------
Anything I'm missing academically by not going to MIT?
For the class of 2025, I was not admitted into MIT. This is fine, but I'm wondering if there is anything that I'll be missing by not taking MIT classes. For those who have taken AP math and science classes in high school, what's the difference between those classes and MIT content-wise? If there's any difference, can you point me to resources where I can fill in my gaps of understanding?

I'm a CS major if that makes a difference.
--------------------------------------------------
Looking to connect with fellow admits to the class of 2025
Hey Y'all, I'm excited that I got into MIT and wanna look for ways to connect with my fellow incoming students. Are there any groups I should know about on discord, instagram, etc.?

Making a Core Major Class Pass/No Record
Hi everyone! 

I just wanted to get people‚Äôs advice on the idea of changing one of my courses to pass/fail grading system. I‚Äôm an aerospace engineering major and I‚Äôm currently taking 16.405 (Robotics Science and Systems) and was thinking that if I changed the grading scheme this semester I‚Äôd be able to put more time into the material without stressing about my grade. 

However, my main concern would be how graduate schools would see that. Since it is one of the capstone courses for Aero/Astro, would it negatively impact me in the long run? I would hate to have it effect my eventual decision to apply to grad school since I heard of similar things happening within course 3. 

Thanks in advance!

UROP Poster presentations, publications, med school confusion
Hello, I wanted to know if anyone has experience/advice for a premed who wants to know more about poster presentations/publications. I'm doing a UROP right now and my postdoc said he wants to get a paper out in the next year and I'll probably be a coauthor, which is really awesome, but I know some people from other schools and they do these presentations/posters at all these different conferences around the country and I'm confused as to how that works? How do people find these conferences and apply to them? I know there is the MIT UROP symposium but what about national conferences?

MIT Media Lab vs Stanford MS CS
Hi Everyone, 

I want to preface this question by saying I am incredibly honored to receive acceptances from the MIT Media Lab (MS MAS) and Stanford (MS CS).  After Masters', I am primarily looking at either working in the industry as a research engineer (hopefully on ML teams) or launching/joining a startup. To be honest, I am not even sure which factors I should be looking at for comparing them because they are both amazing programs! While MAS comes with full funding, Stanford doesn't. However, I do think it is relatively easy to get funded starting from the second quarter (but the uncertainty still exists). I would greatly appreciate your thoughts on this decision :)

Visiting Student Program restart?
I'm an international student at a Canadian university and I recently had a pretty positive interaction with a professor at MIT who was potentially interested in sponsoring me as a student; however, I was told that currently the Visiting Student Program has been paused due to COVID-19 response efforts. Unfortunately, I'm not too aware of the COVID situation in MA, and I was wondering if anyone might have some information as to when the program might restart? At least where I'm currently at, we are planning for a full in-person restart in September as vaccinations have started up

Pre-Med at MIT
Hi everyone! I'm a recent adMIT for regular decision and LOVE LOVE LOVE the school. I was accepted at another ivy under early decision but I genuinely love MIT more than that other school. There's just one thing that's holding me back: the stress of getting into medical school combined with the pressures at MIT. I feel like with the hard classes, the lack of pre-med students, and the comparatively low medical school admit rates, I'd just be struggling at MIT way more than at the other school I've been accepted to. I've also heard that med schools like their doctors to have a "humane" education (whatever that means) that typically doesn't come from tech schools but rather liberal arts schools. I'm planning on majoring in course 5-7 btw. Can anybody at MIT (preferably pre-med kids but whatever is fine!) give advice/anecdotal evidence about my concerns? Thank you in advance!

Hi again! I'm a recent adMIT doing a bit more research on what I want to focus on if I commit MIT. I really love theory generally and am certainly leaning towards studying CS theory and pure math, and would be curious how those subjects are at MIT. Looking at the program and majors guide, 18-C seems like the best major choice for that subject, is this accurate? And for anyone studying 18-C, how is the program?

Thanks, y'all!! I know I have quite a bit of time to decide, but this all still helps me to think ahead :)

Admitted, but not sure if I can handle MIT
Hey all,

I was fortunate enough to be adMITted for the class of 2025 earlier this week, but after the initial wave of shock and euphoria wore off, I realized that I'm genuinely terrified of this school. I have no idea how I got in. I wrote my essays the day apps were due, and had weak extracurriculars (no math competitions/olympiads/research/etc). Frankly, I thought I had no chance, and applied on a whim. I actually called the admissions office the day after decisions released to ensure that it wasn't some sort of mistake.

I go to an uncompetitive high school, and though I've done well there, I feel I'll be ten steps behind other MIT students. I plan to major in 6-3, but my programming experience is very limited (functionally non existent), and I've never taken a physics course. Academics haven't been particularly easy for me either. My peers assume I'm some sort of effortless genius but I spent a lot of time studying in highschool to keep my grades up.

Given my race, I can't help but assume that affirmative action was the deciding factor in my admission. And I hate the thought of struggling to understand material while having to worry about being a representative of other black people (see the recent news about a Georgetown law professor). I feel woefully underprepared compared to the IMO gold medalists and ISEF finalists that I'd be studying with, distinctions I didn't even know existed until a stumbled upon /r/applyingtocollege and /r/chanceme earlier this year.

All that being said, everything I've heard about MIT indicates its a place I'll love. The collaborative student body, the expansive resources, and the sense of passion that MIT exudes as a whole really draws me to the Institute. I'm just afraid that students like me, who come from comparatively low resource backgrounds, won't be capable of succeeding at MIT. As much as I know that this most likely isn't true, a sense of dread lingers whenever I think about going here, as excited as I am to do so. If anyone could provide any insight/advice, I'd really appreciate it, thanks.


EDIT: Every single reply in this thread has been EXTREMELY helpful. I'm still pretty nervous, but all of your advice has provided me with some much needed perspective. Thanks so much!

MIT Masters in Business Analytics vs Cornell Tech Masters Operations Research.
 Hi everyone!

I recently got accepted into both of these amazing programs and am faced with the hard decision to pick one and turn down one. Both programs seem incredibly strong in teaching how to apply technical models to solve industry problems. It seems that main difference in these programs is Cornell Tech‚Äôs Studio Courses vs MIT‚Äôs Capstone and the recruiting timelines (Fall for Cornell, Spring for MIT). 

Also, Cornell Tech has also offered a significant scholarship. What are my chances of getting MIT to offer something similar?

I want to consider as many factors as possible to make up my mind, so I would love to hear your thoughts. Would be curious to hear about Boston vs NYC career pros as cons. 

Background: Currently, I work in economic research, so I have decent technical skills, but I feel like I need to learn a lot more to do the ‚Äòdata science‚Äô type jobs that I want to do.

Graduate Experience at MIT?
Hi!  MIT has been my dream school for years but I have the opportunity to earn my bachelor's at 18 at my local university.  I really want to have the "undergrad experience" at MIT.  How different is the graduate experience and is it worth it to get my bachelor's early and come into MIT as a grad student at 19?

Thoughts on Course 24
Hi!! I'm a recent adMIT, and was curious what philosophy and linguistics are like at MIT. I know the linguistics program is renowned, in large part from Chomsky, but I can't seem to find a lot of good comparative information about the philosophy component of the major. My interests right now are primarily post-structuralism and ontology (of the Heidegger vein), so would MIT have good courses and professors for those subjects? Generally, how is the course? And what are prospects like for graduate school with the major?

MIT Financial Appeal

Entrepreneurship at MIT
Hi guys, so I got into a masters program at Sloan and will be coming to MIT in August ‚Äì super excited! One of my main goals for my time at MIT is to get involved in entrepreneurial activities as much as I can because it's a space I am very curious about and eager to explore.

What is Course 17 like?
Hey, I'm currently a prefrosh considering double majoring or at the very least concentrating in political science, and I was hoping someone could offer some insight into what the classes are like. 

Are the classes extremely reading and writing heavy?  Work load? What do you think of the professors? Class sizes and discussions? Do you find yourself engaged with and interested in the content? What are some of your favorite Course 17 classes? I'm especially interested in 17.445 and 17.447 and was wondering if anyone could offer insight into those specifically.
--------------------------------------------------
What is it like at Sloan?
I've been thinking about transferring here as of late. Do I hate myself? I'm not sure. Anyway, I wanted to know how it is at Sloan? Is it as intensive as the rest of MIT, and are people looked down upon for picking business over something like Engineering? Obviously, my shot at MIT is as much of a shot as a blind person hitting a bullseye, and I know even if I make it, I'm dumped into the full-swing over everything, but I am still curious.

Summer Internship or MOSTEC?
(mods, if this type of post isn‚Äôt allowed, feel free to remove!)

Hiya!

I am a junior about to begin my senior year and college applications process within a few months, and as such, I was looking for summer opportunities for me to pursue to enrich my skills in STEM and be more attractive to colleges.

Ever since I was in 4th grade, I‚Äôve been heavily involved in STEM, participating in FIRST Robotics and directly interacting with my community to spread awareness about STEM and increase opportunities for future generations.

I‚Äôve applied for the MOSTEC summer program, but I also looked for other possibilities in case I am not accepted (which is likely).

I have been offered an internship by a local company that has mentored my team for a long time, and is directly related to what I want to major in (Aeronautical Engineering).

My question to MOSTEC + MIT graduates: what would be the better pick? MIT‚Äôs own MOSTEC program or the summer internship?

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts and suggestions!

Buy ebook Introduction to Linear Algebra - Gil Strang
I want to learn more Linear Algebra, and was recommended the textbook from Dr Strang. Buying the text version of the book directly from Wellesley (http://www.wellesleycambridge.com/) requires sending in physical check, which seems to be a hassle to me, and will take a while before I can get the book.

There are some websites that sell an ebook version of the textbook, for around $15, which I suspect is pirated then re-sell. Where can I buy the official ebook of the book? I want to support Dr Strang, especially on making ebook, as it is my go-to format nowaday.

LGBTQ+ at MIT
This year, I came out to everyone as bisexual, and I want to continue to be out in college. I realize MIT is a fairly liberal college, so I hope they are LGBTQ+ friendly. I'm most curious about how large is the LGBTQ population is at MIT. Is it only a few and it's rare to come across one or is there a decent number of LGBTQ people? Are people generally supportive?
--------------------------------------------------
accepted?
i got in, and i guess i‚Äôm excited, but my extracurriculars and essays were pretty mediocre. they were unique, though, and i guess i want to know if i was admitted for like...being quirky? i can‚Äôt find anything definite about it, but my essays weren‚Äôt very good, i‚Äôm Asian, and i don‚Äôt have major awards or extracurriculars. and the extracurriculars i do have are ones i didn‚Äôt really do well in or even spend that much time in, they were just super niche. it can‚Äôt be a clerical error because my name is pretty uncommon. i guess i‚Äôm asking if anyone else has had a similar application and if so are they managing? That is to say, passing their classes + not thinking that going to MIT was the worst decision they‚Äôve made in their life

Startups during undergrad?
I'm trying to decide where to spend the next four years of my life, and was wondering about startups at MIT. I know MIT is a powerhouse for them, but it seems like most of these are after graduating. I see myself as more of a person who wants to start something supplemented by CS, rather than focus on CS itself, and I really want to explore starting up in college. However, from what I've heard CS @ MIT keeps you quite busy, so I'm wondering what kind of free time CS @ MIT affords undergrads to start startups, and how common this is? Thanks!

BWSI program at MIT
Hi y'all! I'm currently taking the online course that's required *before applying* to the BWSI program at MIT. Which means I have to finish this online course first to even apply (and most likely I will not get in) to the BWSI program. 

So I start it. And I learned that MIT people are too smart. 

First problem: I don't even know how to officially register! The email says to select "spring term" but the piazz thing says there is no "spring term" available, only "summer term"! I violate the rules and click summer term. I'm such a criminal, I know. 

Second problem: Everyone here posting the answers is a freaking genius. Like for some reason they already know how to program different systems and they completely understand AI in gaming and stuff like that. Like why...? Just create your own game already or something. 

Third problem: Every sentence goes on forever. I'm not exxagerating. It's only complex sentences that stretch for paragraphs and the language is more formal than my English teacher's example essay in class. Like how can you be so good at math and English?

tl;dr: wow I'm dumb I thought I was pretty smart but as soon as I started this I feel like I'll never go to a FAANG company and even if I got into MIT I'd fail asap

Socialize through fun and safe in-person experiences around Boston
Hi all, i am sure you all understand how difficult it has been to socialize with like-minded people in an organic way (even pre-pandemic). In the past few months, we have been running one of the most active Meetup group in Boston where hundreds of people have come to our experiences and met really cool people in the area. With meetup, we have experienced a lot of frustation and shortcomings. Today, we are launching our own website [www.alohub.co](https://www.alohub.co/) to really help people find fun and covid safe experiences they can participate in Boston while meeting the coolest people in Boston. Join Alohub and hope to see you in one of our future experiences!

Is MIT really worth it?
I‚Äôm wondering what makes MIT so much better that other universities, particularly for undergrad. Is it really that big of a deal? Do employers treat you differently if you have a degree from MIT?

Thanks.

What's your experience of taking a double major?
I am planning to get Course 6 and 12 by undergraduate simultaneously, and I'm quite sure I will also do a part-time job.

I haven't seen anyone sharing stories of MIT students doing double major. I would love to know to anyone if they had so I could have even just a bit of what to expect and feet ready.

What's your experience of doing a double major? It would be more interesting if you were also a part-time working students and/or with a minor(s).

Thank you very much! God bless! :)

Visual Arts at MIT/ Course 4B?

Is it really that small? Are the visual art classes any good specifically?

Grad Housing - On or Off Campus? Good Dorms? Neighborhoods?
Hello everyone,

I'm likely going to be attending MIT for a Masters in the Fall. Do most grad students live on or off campus? I've been living in apartments in NYC for the last 10 years so I didn't immediately think of on campus housing as an option. Because of COVID, it looks like I won't be making a trip to visit the college/area before moving despite how close it is. This makes me think that it might just be easiest to live in one of the on campus efficiency studios. Living alone for many years and at almost 30 there is no way I can deal with roommates.

If I do go off campus, what neighborhoods should I be looking at? I don't mind a commute on the T as I'm used to taking the subway here in NYC. Ideally would be looking to spend under the $1700 a dorm would cost, but I don't need much space or any amenities or the like. I just want a place that is my own. Does this sound feasible?

Anyone have thoughts on which option is better?

Thoughts on elitism here?
Incoming CS PhD student coming from a small college. The idea of elitism in top universities has always bothered me, so I'm wondering how real this elitism is in the undergrad/grad population.

E.g I hear people at MIT/Harvard refer to BU/Northeastern kids as the ones on "The Dumb Side of the River". Hoping it's not true.  


Edit: Thank you all for your responses! I'm really pleasantly surprised by the environment you've all spoken on. I'm really looking forward to growing academically and losing all faith in my capabilities for my next 4-6 years here :)

Where do MIT students find sublet housing?
I will only be in the area from July - Dec for a co-op job and I am so sorry the housing price is so crazy here. I have not caught up with the Cambridge lingo yet but my workplace is right next to Kendall square subway stop, so I think MIT is close enough to ask for housing advice. SO if you were to look to move around, what websites do you use for finding sublets? What price range is considered acceptable for a room in a shared apartment? 

Thanks a bunch, you smarty pants :) greetings from Michigan.

MIT MechE masters vs CMU masters in Robotic Systems Development
Hello everyone, I have been extremely lucky and fortunate of getting admits from **CMU** (Carnegie Mellon) for the Masters in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD) program and from **MIT** for masters in Mechanical Engineering (SM). I want to pursue a career in robotics in the industry and I am having a **hard time deciding** between the two universities.

A few key points -

* There is a high probability of securing a fully-funded research assistant position at MIT but no financial help from CMU.
* The MRSD program includes computer science, and business coursework around robotics, and can thus help in an industry-based robotics career. On the other hand, the MIT masters program can help in becoming a specialized industry-based researcher, but might also mean that my knowledge is specialized in one particular domain rather than being well rounded (an important factor especially for robotics maybe?)

Could y'all please provide your experience with any of the programs and/or any comments that could help me make a decision?

Pick Between Georgia Tech and MIT Electrical Engineering PhD
I got into MIT and GT. MIT is definitely the best one can find, but I am very confused and unconfident about MIT. I am not certain if I will be able to handle the workload and "brand" pressure at MIT. I also feel like I am not as good as other students at MIT. I don't have clear concepts on many topics, and I am just not crazy smart. Knowing these all, I am unsure if I will be able to survive MIT even if I work hard 24/7. Shall I go to GT instead? How much will the pressure be different in both schools?

November Games
Back in the old days when I was an undergrad, there was a popular midnight weed smoking game played every day from November 1st to through the 30th, usually taking place at one of the East campus dorms. The November Games. It was kind of like Yatzee with bong hits. Sometimes there were upside down bong hits. One time someone's hair caught on fire. That may have been me, but it's hazy. Do  undergrads today still carry on the tradition? Also, does anyone remember the rules?


EDIT: Here's what I've gathered from my own recollection and talking to friends and folks online


Setup

* equipment: Frisbee, five dice, a bong, weed

* start the game by collecting nugs from participants. Chipping in is highly encouraged, but not strictly required. Collection is traditionally done by passing around the Frisbee

* if you don't have one already, pick a glyph to represent yourself for the scoring, e.g. a bow tie or concentric circles


Scoring

* ones and fives score 100 and 50 respectively

* three of a kind scores 100x face value, except for 3 ones, which is 1000

* a natural five of a kind is 2000

* a natural straight is 1500

* you can reroll nonscoring dice until you get a roll that has no scoring dice. Add up all the scoring dice

* if all 5 dice score, pick em all up and roll again. Your score accrues from roll to roll

* first to 5000 stops the game (you're out) and everyone else gets one more roll to try to overtake 


Smoking

* each 1000 points is a "warp" i.e. a bong rip

* five ones is an upside down bong rip


Other rules

* if you get overtaken after getting out, you get "come on". This is permanently recorded. No one wants to get come on

* a come-from-behind (CFB) win, where you over take someone who gets out before you, gets noted as well, but this is a good thing. Contrast with being "come on" 


Still unknown: what's a wimp mark? I can't remember how it's triggered or what happens. I remember people shouting "wimp" real loud, and I'm pretty sure it was related to the game

Are there courses for beginners with no background at MIT that delve into experiments with materiality and nanotechnology?
Hello,

I am an architecture graduate student, and I really enjoy playing with materials and getting my hands dirty, as well as doing some computation. I know nothing about nanotechnology so what I am describing might not make sense, but if it does, I was wondering if anyone knows of beginner courses where students could access labs and experiment with basic ways of manipulating materials at molecular or nano-scale to create something. I have been reading about aerogel and how MIT engineers have been tweaking it to make it more transparent, or how one of the profs and his team created e-ink, and just more generally on carbon and its molecular structure. For those with experience with this subject, how hard is it to play with these concepts? How can a student with no background engage with such topics? Are there any IAP or summer courses for it? Clubs? Labs that welcome non-background students?

Thanks!

Admitted PhD Student
Hi everyone, I have been admitted as a PhD student into the ChemE department for the fall. MIT is definitely a great research and location fit for me, but I am super nervous about the work-life balance/culture of overworking.

I went to a peer institution for UG and worked very hard, so I am not afraid of hard work. However, I still want some semblance of balance in grad school. I know it is generally advisor dependent, but do any grad students have an impression of how the ChemE department compares to other departments? Any horror stories recently? I know EECS and Chem have had a lot of advisor disasters recently. Should I pay attention to these situations?
Any guidance or insight is appreciated.

Questions from an incoming grad student
This is a broad series of questions. As an overview, my girlfriend was admitted to and is planning on attending MIT for grad school this fall. She went to PSU and we realize that a lot of things will be different in terms of culture, academic intensity, and all sorts of other little things. These questions are based on the country overcoming the current pandemic and returning to life as it was prior to Covid. 

First, what is the sports culture like at the university? Obviously there is a difference at the varsity level between PSU and MIT, but what about club and intramural sports? We both love volleyball and enjoyed playing regularly at PSU. Are there active groups that meet regularly?

What is the nightlife like? She unfortunately turned 21 weeks before the pandemic hit and was not able to really enjoy the State College bar scene. She is by no means a party animal, but does enjoy occasional parties or going out with friends. 

Are there any fun things she should know, or that you would like to share? We got a kick from reading about the Smoot, and looking at wacky projects like the Tetris game on the Green building. What makes MIT unique and fun for you?

Perks of being a student?
Recent AdMIT, who discovered the free Kanopy subscription. Any other cool perks or subscriptions that you have found that come with being an MIT student?

Application
I am an international senior in HS and would like to apply to MIT for fall term 2021, is SAT or toefl required for 2021-2022? I am not finding any info for this year‚Äôs requirements about standardized Exams.
--------------------------------------------------
Should I pursue post-graduate studies at MIT?
A little background about me, I grew up in foster care in Southie but I have always been academically gifted. I'm currently working as a part-time janitor at MIT, solving graduate math problems at night, and working in construction. Unfortunately, I have a criminal record with violent offenses but I'm currently seeing a counselor help me integrate into society.  Now to all you MIT alumni out there, I have only one question for you guys. How do you like them apples?

Taking Classes at MIT
Joe Gebbia, one of the founders of Airbnb with a net worth of around $13 billion, went to school at Rhode Island School of Design. His wiki page states that he complemented his creative pursuits and studies at RISD with business coursework at Brown University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology before founding Airbnb. 

Are students able to take certain classes at MIT like Joe Gebbia did? Do these students need to attend certain universities in the states, or can students from a Top 3 uni in Canada also pursue this?

Any help appreciated!
--------------------------------------------------
How much should I expect to pay if my family makes $50k/year (cumulatively)?
I'm kind of concerned about the cost of MIT. My family makes $50k/year and there's a 70ish % chance my sister will also be going onto college around the time I'd graduate.

The AOs I've talked with have all said that MIT is mindful of whatever financial restrictions students may have, however I've heard a couple people say that they weren't able to go to MIT on account of the cost.

If you've been an undegrad at MIT recently and your family made around $50k/year, I was hoping you might be able to give me an estimate about how much I should expect to fork over. Thanks!

Has MIT already canceled the 2021 in-person Commencement ceremony?
I graduated Jan 2020 (Ph.D.) after 6+years and I was really looking forward to having family come over to see me graduate...

Then, of course covid happened and I chose to let MIT keep my paper degree for whatever future in-person event will happen.

And here we are, getting somewhat closer to the new Commencement date... But it seems like end of May / early June is going to be too early covid-wise. 

Has MIT communicated their plans so far? Is the word on he street that they will do something later (end of summer?) when covid should be better? What about the class of 2020?


After almost 8 years in Boston/Cambridge I was ready to move on to something new so I took a job in the West Coast... I kind of miss Boston. Looking forward to stopping by and revisiting old places.

Please help! Grad School Acceptance Letters
Hello! When do acceptance letters typically arrive for grad school programs? I've heard it's January, but I've also heard it's March, so I'm a little confused. My program is EECs if that makes a difference.

Is 15-2 and 6-14 the way to go?
Hi everybody, sophomore here. I heard 6-14 and 15-2 is a chill double major, with a decent amount of job prospects, but i‚Äôm not sure how accurate that is. From what i‚Äôve experienced while looking for internships, finance majors are more secure but i‚Äôm not too sure i want to go into that. I am in a position where i can graduate with the double major in 3 years, and i was thinking about applying to the mban(masters of business analytics) program to finish everything in 4 years. Or, I can stay for the 4th year and take as many interesting/important classes as I want, instead of paying the 80k+ that I would for the mban. I‚Äôm not too sure about everything, so please let me know if you have any advice or experience. Thx :))))

Anyone else taking 18.600?
How did you feel about that first lecture? I have the necessary pre-requisites for the class, but I could barely keep up with what the professor was saying. I left the lecture feeling like I learned nothing and I have no idea how to start most problems on the homework.

I was excited to take this class but I really don't believe I can learn the material if the first lecture is any reflection of the future lectures. Does anyone else have similar feelings?

Slippery Outdoor Stairs
Gathering Experience to deal with Cold Weather Problems: from Texas

Hi all. 

I am a student at TAMU, and in the past few days. we experienced weather for which I am not prepared for a variety of scenarios that come along with cold weather. But, of all the things, I felt that I was totally unprepared for walking on outdoor stairs(mostly concrete constructions). I am curious if anyone at MIT faces this issue, as sleet and snowfall is a common phenomenon in MA. If yes, any tips for dealing with it?
--------------------------------------------------
retrieving items left in room
so last year (spring 2020), i left my mini-fridge in my room (labelled with my name and kerb). however, this year i'm in a new dorm building. i contacted the housing operations manager of both my old dorm (where i left the fridge) and my new dorm, but haven't received a response from either.

someone told me piece by piece movers might have it, but i checked my account at storagemit and it shows a picture of every box they picked up, but the fridge is not pictured so it doesn't look like they picked it up. is there anyone else i could contact in order to retrieve my mini fridge, or should i keep trying to get in contact with the housing operations managers?

Ph.D. student life/housing questions
Hi everyone! 

I got into a Ph.D. program at MIT a few days ago, and it's one of my top choices. I kind of want to get a feel for grad student life at MIT before I accept, but can't visit for obvious reasons. If I accept the offer, I suspect I'll have to pick an apartment/neighborhood basically sight-unseen. I have a couple questions, and it would be great to hear what y'all think.

In my current college town, there are, like, grad student residential areas and undergrad-y residential areas, differentiated mostly by noise level and (social) fraternity/sorority population. I suspect the latter's not an issue at MIT, but are there quieter neighborhoods close to campus? Or are all neighborhoods roughly the same? 

Related question: is grad student housing any good? Or should I look for an apartment? I sort of assumed grad student housing wouldn't be great since it isn't at a lot of the other places I applied, but maybe I'm wrong. My financial situation is ok: I don't have tons to spend, but my stipend offer is really generous. I *hated* living in the dorms my freshman year of college, though, because I like lots of privacy and quiet. But maybe that's not a problem in grad student housing at MIT. (I just don't want a roommate.) 

Finally, is there anything else I should know about grad student life on MIT's campus, or living on/off campus? Or anything else worth knowing generally about the city/school? Thanks a bunch!

CSAIL PhD co-advising/collaboration/lab switching?
I am an incoming CSAIL PhD student, starting in Fall 2021. There are quite a few advisors that I am interested in working with - I'm wondering what the culture is like with regards to collaboration between labs, as well as how difficult it is to switch advisors or add a co-advisor. Are you able to forge your own connections, and switch/add advisors easily if research interests align more, or are people pretty stuck into the lab they start out with? Would love to hear people's experiences. Thanks!

How much knowledge in Physic is required to take 6.004? Is it possible to take it without 8.02 Physics II?
Hi MIT student, I am currently self-teach myself CS, and I came across this wonderful courses on OCW recently. I know this is a computer organization course, but does it really require Physics II level knowledge? I really want to take this course but I have pretty poor foundation in Physics, so I would like to know how feasible it is to take this course without Physics II, thank you

Where is Qinxuan Pan?
The Yale grad student Kevin Jiang was murdered at Yale by an unknown suspect. 

 Qinxuan Pan (current MIT Grad student) was found nearby the scene late at night with a broken down car. It was later reported that the car was stolen. He was investigated by police but was let go and has been missing since. 

Apparently he was spotted last night in Georgia. Where is he?

Also new photos were released of Pan with Kevin Jiang‚Äôs fianc√© in 2020 at a social event. Maybe it was a love triangle gone wrong.

Condolences to the family, fianc√© and friends of Kevin Jiang.

I‚Äôm curious what everyone thinks or if anyone knows Pan

Grad student couples housing
There is a good chance that me and my girlfriend go to grad school at MIT next year (funded PhD). I saw that there were options for couples housing on the website, but they needed a marriage certificate or joint finances, which we do not have yet. Has anyone used couples housing and had this issue? Is there any other on campus/off campus housing options we should look at?

Is it bad that I haven't figured out a pod yet? Also how do you figure out your room-mate?
I just don't feel like I can determine who I wanna be with just by seeing random people's profiles/a game of among us... At least for me, I don't really show personality that well through those types of things, idk

Also you need to know your roommate since they're automatically in your pod right?

Need help finding syllabus for 2.16 Learning Machines
I'm doing research on other universities to find out what courses they offer covering AI in the mechanical/aerospace discipline  and what they cover. I found that MIT once offered a course called 2.16 Learning Machines with Professor Barbastathis but I couldn't find a syllabus online for the course. Have any of you taken the course before and still have a copy of your syllabus? It would really help me out if any of you could send it to me. Thank you!

How hard is course 12? Course 1?
Hi! I'm a human being who is planning on going to MIT class of 2025. I haven't committed yet, and thats because I am pretty scared of the difficulty. I know I COULD do great at MIT, and I'm not afraid of  hard work, but I can't imagine spending all of my waking hours during the week doing schoolwork. 

I want to form relationships and explore Cambridge and be in a couple clubs. Again, something even like an 8 or 10 hour day of study sounds ok. But 12 or 14? Idk man. 
While I revel in schoolwork I find interesting (which, admittedly, is most of it), I have had a very limited social life in high school and would like to make a couple solid friends in college.

Basically: is it possible to have a work-life balance while taking course 12

Important note: I have adhd and auditory processing issues, so focus and comprehending verbal spews are not my strongest suits.

How exactly am I supposed to "rush" a frat
So rush kicked off yesterday and I got the chance to see all of the different fraternities. Are we expected to have chosen one by now? Each frat has like 50 events to go to in the next week or so but I still haven't decided which one's I want to join. Is it okay if I miss the majority of events for a particular frat just because there are so many others I want to attend? Thanks!

What to expect at MIT EECS PhD? (Fun or Gun)
Hi folks! Got accepted into the EECS MIT PhD and best moment of my life! Was wondering what to expect before I step in. How's the department environment- collaborative, toxic? How difficult is it usually and the courseworks? You guys get to hang out/ maintain a healthy work life balance? What about the drop-out rate? Does it ever happen that people drop out with a master's and not being able to finish PhD? Is it allowed/doable/"if-you-do-you're-blacklisted"? I am so nervous, feel like I won't be able to handle all those workload. But reality time here so please give me the genuine info!
--------------------------------------------------
How grueling is surviving MIT?

Has anyone had success substituting a class for 18.062/6.042J?
In particular, has anyone successfully substituted 18.100B or 18.600 for 18.062? It seems a bit redundant to take 18.062 and 18.100B given that they are both essentially introductory proofs classes.

Thoughts on Leave of Absence

I was wondering if anyone has taken this IAP (either in 2020 or 2021) and has the missing lectures on Linear Algebra and Linear Regression, as well as the second pset?

6-14 sophomore's worries
tl;dr: I'm worried that I'll be underqualified for SWE or data science jobs after graduation.

I'm trying to find internship opportunities for this coming summer and I realize I feel underqualified for everything.

I feel like I'm not good enough at coding to do any SWE internships, and don't have nearly enough knowledge (don't know SQL, never taken a machine learning class) for data science internships. I'm in the UPOP program, but it's really unclear which partnering companies offer data science/data analysis positions for inexperienced sophomores like me instead of people with masters and PhDs.

This has even gotten me doubting my major choice. I love my econ classes and am \~optimistically dealing\~ with the essential CS classes, but should I do 6-3 with an econ minor/concentration instead?

How to prepare for Flight Controls Internship (Freshman)
Hello everyone! 

I recently accepted an internship in the above mentioned field. I have already taken 6.0001/2, 18.02, and 8.01, what classes (considering those pre-reqs) would you consider I take to better for repare myself. I just want to make sure I perform during this great opportunity. Thank you.

How long does it take to have a Doctorate degree in MIT?
I researched and said it will take 5 years. But I don't understand if undergraduate degrees is under that 5 years and it would only took one year for the doctorate programs.

And how many years will it take depending on the degree, subjects, or course?
--------------------------------------------------
What are the "first year expenses"?
I was wondering about what does MIT mean by first year expenses. I'm guessing it's the cost of supplies needed for moving to campus for incoming freshman but surely it can't possibly be as much as $2000?
--------------------------------------------------
Acceptance letter detail - just curious
I though MIT didn't send paper letters? Especially abroad? Well, anyway I got one in the mail today and I am so very excited about it (it's like getting you acceptance all over again)!

Anyways, on the actual acceptance letter and on the certificate of admission there is a tiny little number 31 on the bottom right corner (it's not there on the other two pages with more information). I was wondering whether that number means anything? My first thought is that it's just something by which to conveniently sort this stuff together. Or is there another reason?
--------------------------------------------------
Please help!! With dorm choice!
Hi everyone! This is like my third post on here just asking some questions about the MIT. I'm not sure which dorm to choose- while I'd ideally like to be on e ast campus, I'm not really a partier, and every hall of east campus is very different and I get confused. Plus I'm kinda autistic so I prefer more quiet, personal gatherings.

Can anyone offer me some insight into dorms, specifically east campus? I know that's where the weird people go so I'd like to be there but I am not party girl

Anyone have experience with the MSRP (Summer Research Program)? What did you think of it?
My planned internship this summer unfortunately got cancelled due to the surge in COVID so I reviewed the other summer opportunities I applied for, which includes the MSRP. I've not been able to find much discussion on the program from people who previously participated it. Has anyone here been in the program, and if so, what did you think of it? Was it a wise way to spend a summer?
--------------------------------------------------
Those of you who didn‚Äôt think you could pay for MIT but still enrolled anyway, how did you do it?
I was accepted and I have to say that MIT is by far my top choice. Basically my dream school. But the financial aid isn‚Äôt looking good. I know MIT doesn‚Äôt do merit scholarships and I‚Äôd be allowed to work to make up part of the tuition but it isn‚Äôt enough. We can maaaaaaaaaaybe scrap by the first year but no way we can do all four. 

I guess I‚Äôm asking for advice here on how to attend. 
Sorry if this goes against the first rule, I wasn‚Äôt sure if it did or not since I was technically already admitted. Just let me know what y‚Äôall think. Thanks!!!
--------------------------------------------------
Is Environmental science worth it at MIT?
Now, right off the bat, I know MIT has no enviro science major. I'm considering either course 12 or enviro-engineering. However, I am a bit torn. I have already been accepted to MIT (yay EA), and I've applied to both Stanford and Harvard, both of which are ranked higher than MIT for Environmental science on just every list I can find.  


If I get accepted to either of these schools, should I go? I consider myself a pretty weird/ unique/ excitable person (read: BIG aspergers), and the culture at MIT sounds PERFECT for me!! Like, literally perfect. I want to do stupid things with people and create ideas and collaborate to make things come to reality. But I also want to go to a school that will prepare me to help the environment in the best way I can (I am especially interested in sustainable agriculture.) Other schools with more flexible majors than MIT may allow me to better explore my interests in both agriculture and STEM. 

&#x200B;

Before you say "why don't you consider these schools if/when you get accepted? Don't count your chickens before theyve hatched," I am a very anxious person who is exceptionally bad at making decisions. Therefore, I would like as much time to think about this as possible. If I don't get into Stanford or Harvard, TRUST me, I will be very relieved. This means I will not have to make a diffucult decision.

&#x200B;

Ps, I am also thinking about attending Rice. Thoughts? I love the lack of greek life and it seems kinda like diet MIT.
--------------------------------------------------
Possible to enroll in 2 courses with overlapping lecture time slots?
I'm interested in enrolling in 2 courses for the spring term, but they have one day where they both overlap in lecture time (as in they both meet one day at the same time). Does anyone know if MIT allows students to enroll in 2 courses where there might be some lecture timeslot overlap? I was presuming this would not be an issue practically since the lectures for both courses are recorded and everything is virtual, but wasn't sure how MIT handled the logistics and whether it was allowed or not. Thanks!

looking for MIT current student(s) to do IDEAS/Sloan Healthcare innovation challenge with
hello my name is jose i am a civil engineering student at george mason university in northern virginia. i have a solution to police brutality and a campaign im doing as per recommendation by my county manager and county police. here is the page [https://www.facebook.com/Solving-Police-Brutality-106705394743281](https://www.facebook.com/Solving-Police-Brutality-106705394743281) the solution/idea is: if you witness police brutality, call 911, report your location where you see it, then the dispatcher will radio call the police officer doing the police brutality and tell him to stop. the police info desk told me its a good idea and the best way is to call 911, etc because they have GPS tracking of each officer so they know who to radio call to tell them to stop. so i am asking for an MIT student(s) to join me in doing this idea for the IDEAS challenge and/or my other solution to covid via a contact tracing app/idea for the Sloan healthcare innovation challenge. the guidelines say i need an mit student. if you want to join please let me know or if you know another current MIT student that wants to.

Vanguard to Blackrock
I got this email today, I‚Äôm on mobile, sorry for the shit formatting. I can‚Äôt believe this is literally three months after they settled the class action lawsuit about not providing good 401(k) options. What, was that a slap on the wrist? I‚Äôve only looked up one of the fun so far but it‚Äôs the index fund and it has .31% fees versus the .02% that the Vanguard fund it is replacing has. Can we *do* something?

Dear MIT 401(k) Plan Participant,

On behalf of MIT, the MIT Supplemental 401(k) Oversight Committee (‚ÄúCommittee‚Äù) regularly monitors and reviews the investment options offered in the 401(k) Plan. Recently, the Committee, with the guidance of its investment consultant, has decided to replace nine funds in the Plan with similar plans from the same asset classes. This fund change will occur during the evening of February 22, 2021. You are not required to take any action. The following is an explanation of the change and when it will occur. 

What Funds Will Be Changed?

The following funds will be replaced:

Current Fund to Be Eliminated	Replacement Fund

Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares	BlackRock U.S. Debt Income Fund F

Vanguard Total Stock Market Institutional Plus Shares	BlackRock Russell 3000 Index Fund F

Vanguard Value Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Russell 1000 Value Fund F

Vanguard Growth Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Russell 1000 Growth Fund F

Vanguard Mid‚ÄêCap Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Mid Capitalization Equity Index Fund F

Vanguard Small‚ÄêCap Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Russell 2000 Index Fund F

Vanguard US‚ÄêReal Stock Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock FTSE EPRA/NARIET U.S. Index Fund F

Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares	BlackRock MSCI ACWI ex‚ÄêU.S. IMI Index Fund F

Vanguard Emerging‚ÄêMarkets Stock Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund F

If you have invested in any of the current funds listed above, your investments will be moved automatically to the corresponding replacement fund. Your election to have future contributions invested in any of the current funds will also be automatically changed to the corresponding replacement funds. No action on your part is required.

The replacement funds are very similar to the current funds. They are of the same asset class; invest in many of the same securities; and follow a similar, though slightly different, market index. As always, we encourage all Plan participants to review their 401(k) account allocation regularly to confirm that it continues to be compatible with their retirement savings strategy.

Fact sheets for the new funds will be available in early February on the MIT Human Resources website at https://hr.mit.edu/benefits/401k and will also be posted on Fidelity‚Äôs NetBenefits website in late February.

When Is the Fund Change Happening?

The fund transfer will be made during the evening of February 22, 2021. Any fund transfers that you request before 4:00 pm EST on February 22, 2021, will be made before the current funds are replaced. Any of your investments that are automatically transferred to the new funds will be available for you to review on the Fidelity NetBenefits website after 7:00 am EST, February 23, 2021.

Why Are the Funds Being Changed?

The Committee regularly reviews the performance and fees of the investment options in the Plan. As part of this due diligence, it compared certain funds in the Plan to outside options with similar characteristics, evaluating their respective performance, index tracking variance, fund transaction costs and fund management fees. After completing its review, the Committee chose to replace the nine funds described above.

Information from Fidelity

Later this week, Fidelity will send you an announcement with detailed information about the fund changes. Please take the time to read the Fidelity announcement so you are fully informed about the changes taking place.

If you have questions, please contact the Fidelity Benefits Center at 877-648-7283 or MIT Benefits at benefits@mit.edu or 617-253-6151.

Found: MIT class ring, 2018
Looks like a woman's ring--size 5.5-6ish, silver, 2018 with the skyline on the sides, beaver ton the top, dome on one side, bunch of people on the other, an inscription. If this is you or you know who, please LMK.

How can a non-engineering student at MIT learn how to use machine tools?
I am an MIT graduate student who is not in engineering but is interested in getting hands-on experience in operating machine tools for my own personal education. What would be the best way for a beginner like me to get that experience, both during COVID and once everything is relatively back to normal? I am peripherally aware of a few resources but don't know much about them (Central Machine Shop, Edgerton Center, maybe a class in ME?) Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
--------------------------------------------------
Is there any difference between subjects with essentially similar content?
Prefrosh here, MIT math department listed that 18.06 and 18.700 have similar content (both linear algebra) but I thought as the 18.700 have the first digit higher than 0, it might be a bit more difficult version of 18.06. Is it generally true? I mean, is there many difference between them? 

Also 18.04 and 18.112 are both functions of complex variable, what's the difference between them?

Math culture at MIT
Hi! I‚Äôm a '25 adMIT looking into Course 18 and was curious about the math department culture ‚Äî just generally what it‚Äôs like and the kinds of people who study it ‚Äî and whether it would be a good fit for me.

Something I was just concerned is that when I‚Äôm talking to other adMITs, it seems as if all the Course 18s know each other from math competitions/camps, and I haven‚Äôt done those things and I‚Äôm not currently part of those communities. And while I‚Äôve studied a lot of university-level math in high school, I feel as if I have a weaker foundation since I feel I haven‚Äôt studied mathematics in as much depth as other people ‚Äî though I guess this is a more minor point because I shouldn‚Äôt shy away from math just because it‚Äôs intimidating.

I‚Äôm also interested in the more applied side of things (rather than something like pure math research) and in particular math‚Äôs applications in the natural sciences or CS, so I‚Äôm thinking about whether a science major would be a better fit for me (or for CS I might just do 18C).

So I guess my main question is, what is the Course 18 experience like for someone who didn‚Äôt do traditional math competitions? In general, what kind of person is/is not a good fit for Course 18?

Gluten free @ MIT
I read MIT dinig halls have gluten free option, tho I'm prefrosh so I'm asking, how great is gluten free options at MIT dining hall? Have you had any issues with it? 

Also, how great is the gluten free food from nearby fast-food restaurants? (as I heard eating at Chipotle and other fast food chains are sometimes better than having a meal plan)
--------------------------------------------------
Renting or buying a mini-fridge for the spring
Any upperclassmen know where I could rent a mini-fridge at MIT? I looked at Microfridge, and MIT wasn't on their list. Buying a mini-fridge for ~$150 also seems like an option, but since I've never been on campus, I don't know if that's needed.
--------------------------------------------------
7.03 & 5.12
Hi, I‚Äôm a frosh trying to decide my classes for the spring and I was wondering if anyone knows anything about the difficulty/workload of these 2 classes. I‚Äôm planning on taking 7.03, 8.02, 5.12, and 9.00‚Äìdoes this seem like a doable schedule? I heard that 5.12 is really hard and I‚Äôm not sure if I should take it alongside 7.03. I felt like I overloaded myself a bit in the fall and would like to avoid that this spring especially since I will be adjusting to life on campus. Any advice at all would be appreciated!

Is Fortran still taught to mechanical engineering students?
Honestly, it feels like c/c++ could totally replace Fortran for most simulations however I was wondering if MIT still taught it or used it for mechanical engineering.

Off Campus Rooms w/ Private Baths
Heyy

So I'm moving to Greater Boston and I've been apartment searching but none of the sites I've been using have a private bath filter. I don't mind rooming with others but the thought of sharing a bath just makes me really anxious and uncomfortable.

Does anyone know where's a good place to start searching? I'm an undergrad btw. I've tried the MIT off campus, but the 2/3 apartments I've seen, don't have pics of the bathrooms or rest of the apartment. Which always seems kind of sketch to me.

What‚Äôs the Point of Returning?
I‚Äôm a sophomore, and I‚Äôm having trouble understanding why any students are choosing to return to campus (and pay housing and tuition) unless they have an unstable or non existing home to return to. There aren‚Äôt any events and instruction is still online, so the only real benefits I can think of are access to (some) facilities and small pods. I‚Äôm interested to hear other people‚Äôs inputs. Clearly I chose to stay home, but now I‚Äôm not sure if I should be having FOMO lmao
--------------------------------------------------
Has anyone taken 18.102 or 18.152? or know where to find info from other students?
I'm a junior trying to decide what to take in the spring and while I found things like findmyprofessor, and the course evaluations, I'm wondering if those are the only places with that kind of information, or if there's anyone who has firsthand knowledge with the courses or with Professors Jerison and Rodriguez.

Summer programs for entering college students
I got admitted to MIT Class '25 few weeks before and now I'm looking for ways to spend my summer as effectively as possible. As someone who's really looking forward to do research in pure math, I found almost no math research summer program that'd suit me, mainly because most summer programs are for high school juniors or current undergraduates. Also most research projects were about science, not math.

Is there any great math summer programs for entering college students? It doesn't have to be research program, or organized at MIT.

Can I get medication for hair loss at the MIT Medical?
Hi. I'm a new MIT graduate student and I have been taking dutasteride to prevent hair loss back when I was in my country. 

So I want to visit a doctor and get a medication, but I'm not sure about it because the MIT Medical website says MIT dermatology doesn't treat patients with hair loss unless due to alopecia areata, and they have some referral. Mine is not the case, since my hair loss problem is more like a preventive measure.

So anyway, have any of you have some kind of experience, please share with me. Thanks in advance.

18 Grad Courses Grading
I‚Äôm interested in taking courses like 18.905 (Algebraic Topology 1) and 18.705 (Commutative Algebra) next fall, but it would be my first time taking grad classes in course 18 that aren‚Äôt cross registered with undergrad. What is the grading like for these classes? On one hand, the material will clearly be difficult. But I‚Äôve also heard that grad classes are more lenient with grades and mostly give As. What‚Äôs the truth?

Summer Housing!
Hi y'all! I'm a non-MIT student who is planning to live in Boston next summer for my internship. So far in my housing search, one of the biggest recommendations has been to try and find fraternity housing. As I'm not a student, I'm extremely unfamiliar with the reputation or character of the frats here, so I'm just looking for some guidance! If you don't feel comfortable commenting on this post feel free to PM me! Thank you so much in advance!

Some of the Frats I've been looking at (Phi Kappa Theta, Sigma Chi, Phi Kappa Sigma, Theta Xi, Pi Lambda Phi)

How involved of an experience is StartMIT?
I'm wondering whether it makes sense for me to put the class on listener and do research for credit alongside it, since I don't have any current interest in actually starting a business. I sighed up for the workshop mostly to learn what entrepreneurship is about, and maybe find a small team to work on a small project with.

If anyone here is a StartMIT alum and can speak to this point, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------
Remote Synchronous PE
Has anyone done one of the remote synchronous PE classes? Sounds like it'd be kinda awkward to do yoga, pilates, etc. with everyone's zoom camera/audio on and everything, but I wonder if it's worth sucking it up to get some PE credits out of the way.
--------------------------------------------------
6.437 and 18.650
I am planning on taking 6.437 next semester, and I was wondering if there is a lot of overlap with 18.650 since I also want to take that next semester.
--------------------------------------------------
IAP class not available?
I pre-registered for an IAP class, but I've yet to see it show up in Canvas or receive an email from the course instructor. I'm also not sure where to find the zoom link for the class (which starts tomorrow). Is this normal? Or did I not get in the class?

Sorry if this is an obvious question. First time taking a class during IAP.
--------------------------------------------------
Do I receive two separate degrees for a double major?
I'm considering to double major in Physics and EECS at MIT (possibly minors in MechE and Mathematics). Would I receive two separate degrees (one for Physics and one for EECS) if I double major in Physics and EECS?
--------------------------------------------------
Poker clubs/groups at MIT
I'm coming to MIT for grad school next year and I'm wondering whether i should bring my poker table. Are there established poker groups on campus and if so, do they have card tables already? Do they usually hold home games?
--------------------------------------------------
Going on campus
As housing decisions are complete I was wondering what the general mood was about wether people will go to campus and why they made that decision.

I think the campus experience is a great one to have, especially as a freshman, but is it worth risking 2 plane flights to get it? And will it really be that different from staying home, where I'm perfectly safe and happy?
--------------------------------------------------
CS Classes for a 6-1/8 Double Major
I'm a 6-1/8 double major looking to get sufficient CS background for research/physics grad school. If I only want to take 2-3 CS classes (may not be able to fit more in my schedule), which would be best to take? I ASEd 6.0001 and have audited a discrete math class, have become fairly fluent in Python/Mathematica, and have some machine learning experience through a research project (mainly self-taught). I was planning to do 6.006 and 6.036 (instead of 6.009), but would like any recommendations/advice. Thanks in advance!

Also, I was planning to take 6.141 in the future. Is 6.006 sufficient, or would 6.009/something else also help?
--------------------------------------------------
Any interest in a more expansive course eval site?
At the beginning of every semester, I find myself wishing that there was more information on the course evals site, for example, comments or grade cutoffs. Am I the only one? I'd be happy to throw together a website if people would contribute to it.
--------------------------------------------------
8.01/2 ASE Difficulty compared to OCW Psets
So I've been preparing for the 8.01 ASE (haven't started for the 8.02 as yet) and I spend on average between 4 and 6 hours completing the psets. For those of you who have taken the ASE or the 8.01/2 finals, how difficult were they compared to the psets?
--------------------------------------------------
Do they use the really long q tips when covid testing? + Macgregor q's
Title.

Do they use that super long q tip covid testing thing? Or do they have another less painful way of testing which is reasonably accurate?

On another note, how dirty are the dorms (specifically the carpet) at MacGregor. I ended up getting my 6th choice, and unfortunately I have shitty allergies. 

I appealed to try to get into one of the dorms with hardwood rooms, but IDK if it's going to work out. They did say they would try to move me though!
--------------------------------------------------
Do most MIT dorm rooms have 20 amp outlets (outlets with sideways "T")?
The outlets rated for 20 A should have a sideways "T" as one of the prongs.
--------------------------------------------------
Do old OCW courses have any substance in 2021?
First and foremost, happy New Years. I have been planning my self-study OpenCourseWare ‚Äúroadmap‚Äù (EECS) and have found a lot of courses that are from 2009-2011. Is there any point in doing these courses considering the fact that certain fields have advanced greatly in the past decade? I am aware that EDX has updated courses but some of the courses I need are not on there as well. I feel that learning old material cannot be of use or substance in modern times because it might be the ‚Äúold way‚Äù to solve problems or some techniques/skills might be antiquated. I am in no way complaining or criticizing OCW; I am thankful for the availability of these courses. Thank you.

Return to campus for Spring?
For current students, what are your plans for the spring semester? Are the majority of your friends/peers returning to campus or staying home? The deadline to cancel housing is coming up, and although I'd feel safer at home, I can't help but feel like I'd miss out/lack a social life since everyone in my circle of friends are returning to campus.

Has anyone else tested inconclusive/invalid through COVID pass?
I keep getting an inconclusive/invalid test result in COVID pass, this is the 2nd time.  It always seems to happen right before a weekend or a break when testing is unavailable, so I'm stuck waiting until Monday to get my next test and put my mind at ease.  Everyone I've talked to at MIT medical doesn't seem to know what inconclusive/invalid means.  When it happened the first time I was told to "treat it as if I'm positive" but then I subsequently tested negative a few days later and have never tested positive. 

I basically want to know, has this been happening to anyone else on campus? And has anyone else gotten a better answer for what the heck this test result means??

Being a woman on campus
Hi! I done got int to MIT for the class of 2025 and plan on attending (unless I get accepted to Yale or Stanford, neither of which is very likely.)

Anyways, I'd just like to know what it's like to be a woman on campus? I'm a low-income, white girl from the rural midwest and I'm pretty into punk/alternative culture. I'm interested in dating in college since I waited all throughout highschool. What is that like at MIT?  I'm not entirely sure what I'd like to major in, But I'll probably go with course 12 or course 1 cause I'm a tree hugger nerd.

Basically: does having a poor background or being a female bring about discrimination at the MIT campus?

&#x200B;

Edit: I've heard MIT guys don't date MIT girls. Is that true?

Why is there an ASE for 6.0001 and not 6.0002 if they're each other's half term courses? I had thought that we needed to take both but if there's only ASE for 6.0001, does that mean that 6.0002 isn't a prereq for course 6 courses?

6.001x inputs needed
Hi all, 
I‚Äôm currently learning python basics on Codecademy and about to begin 6.001x on Jan 27 on edX. This is a part of my mandatory courses to complete before beginning my graduate program at MIT next fall. I have a few questions for people who have done this course - 

1. What is the difficulty level (from a beginner‚Äôs perspective) and the no of recommended hours per week needed for this course (p-sets, assignments etc)? 
2. Will a basic Python introductory course on Codecademy be a good Segway to start 6.001x? 
3. Say I finish 6.001x - would you recommend starting 6.002x immediately? Or work on other projects, apply the concepts in python in other places and then return to take 6.002x
4. Did you need additional resources while taking 6.001 or 6.002? What were they?

EDIT - Found a few really useful reviews on these courses. In case anyone else has similar questions:

Seth Lloyd Update
To the members of the MIT community,

Following the Goodwin Procter report on MIT‚Äôs interactions with Jeffrey Epstein, President Reif asked that I create a process to review its findings about Professor Seth Lloyd and to identify any appropriate action. I created a two-part review and decision-making process with two faculty committees: one to review facts and determine, based on those facts, whether Professor Lloyd violated any MIT policy, and the second to recommend disciplinary action, if necessary. I write today to share the results of this intensive two-stage effort and the decision I have reached. 

Before I begin, I would like to emphasize that I am taking the unusual step of sharing this information with our entire community because of the unique public nature of the case and its impacts. Professor Lloyd knows that I am taking this step, and he understands and accepts that the outcome of this disciplinary process should be shared openly.

The Review Panel

I assembled a panel of five senior faculty leaders from across the Institute and asked them to determine if Professor Lloyd violated MIT policies. The members of the panel were Professor Rohan Abeyaratne, Institute Professor Daron Acemoglu, Institute Professor Penny Chisholm, Materials Science and Engineering Department Head Jeffrey Grossman, and Dean of Science Nergis Mavalvala (chair). The panel members reviewed the Goodwin report as well as other documents they deemed relevant and met with a number of individuals, including the Goodwin fact-finders and Professor Lloyd, several times.  

Based on this review, a majority of the members found that, in connection with donations he received from Epstein in 2012, Professor Lloyd violated MIT‚Äôs conflict of interest policy (Policies & Procedures 4.4) by failing to inform MIT that Epstein was a convicted sex offender and that, in doing so, he violated MIT‚Äôs policy on faculty misconduct (Policies & Procedures 3.4.2). A minority of the members could not conclude one way or the other that his actions violated the conflict of interest policy. 

The full panel further determined that he did not violate any MIT policies in accepting a gift from Epstein in 2005‚Äì2006 and a donation in 2017. The panel members did not find that Professor Lloyd tried to circumvent the MIT vetting process nor that he sought to conceal the name of the donor. They did conclude, however, that he failed to reveal crucial information about Epstein‚Äôs background to anyone at MIT.

The Evaluation Committee

The panel submitted its findings to a separate evaluation committee consisting of Dean of Engineering Anantha Chandrakasan, Mechanical Engineering Department Head Evelyn Wang, Physics Department Head Peter Fisher, Mechanical Engineering Associate Department Head Pierre Lermusiaux, and Faculty Chair Rick Danheiser. The evaluation committee convened several times, including meetings with the review panel members and with Professor Lloyd. Based on the panel‚Äôs conclusions, the evaluation committee recommended a set of disciplinary actions, which they stated "focused on Professor Lloyd‚Äôs poor judgment and the impact of his actions on the community, which he may not have yet fully appreciated."

My Decision

After conferring with senior administrative and faculty leaders, as well as the two committees, I have decided to implement the recommended disciplinary actions. 

For a period of five years, a set of disciplinary actions will limit Professor Lloyd‚Äôs compensation, his ability to engage in solicitation of donors and foundations, and his involvement in first-year undergraduate advising, and will impose several other restrictions on normal privileges accorded to a faculty member. In addition, Professor Lloyd will be expected to undergo training on professional conduct before resuming certain activities on campus, including teaching. 

These steps cannot undo the harm done. Professor Lloyd‚Äôs failure to share what he knew about Epstein‚Äôs conviction when he accepted his 2012 donations was unacceptable. His interactions with Epstein and certain of his actions surrounding acceptance of the donations serve to highlight the importance of the current Institute-wide effort to develop clearer guidelines for engaging with donors. 

I recognize that many in our community remain deeply disturbed by the interactions with Jeffrey Epstein and that some will be disappointed by this decision. In addition, for some, this outcome may renew past pain. If you feel you would benefit from support or guidance at this time, you can find a range of resources here.

I would like to close by extending my gratitude to the entire MIT community for your engagement, your candor, and your care for MIT.

Sincerely,

Martin A. Schmidt

Hi All! Hope you are staying healthy!

I am working through 6.004, but am struggling with some labs (found here: [https://computationstructures.org/exercises/cmos/lab.html](https://computationstructures.org/exercises/cmos/lab.html)).

Does anyone know if there are solutions or additional info anywhere? I'd like to continue working through these!

Thank you!

Edit: Should have clarified, I am going through this on my own through open-courseware, not a current student enrolled at MIT. Don't have any support for discussing labs, so having solutions would help to point me in the right direction when I'm stuck. Thanks!

18.330
Has anyone taken 18.330? Can you share your experience with this class? As I understand, this class would teach me to do numerical computation using programming languages. Is this true?

Course 2A-CIR vs 6-1/6-2
I want to do robotics or controls, but I‚Äôm not sure which major to choose. Course 2 classes seem more hands on and exciting (2.007, 2.009, etc.), and I really like CAD. but I want to get a masters and I heard a lot of people in the robotics industry need a masters. course 2 don‚Äôt seem to have an easier masters program admission for mit undergrads like course 6 does with meng with a lower gpa requirement (Course 2 suggests a 4.8 gpa for senior early admission and requires a gre score and I heard mengs require a 4.00/4.25 So it seems like a meng is easier to get) Also course 6 meng has a degree in controls while course 2 ms does not. can anyone who choose course 6 over 2 to do robotics tell me why and if they don‚Äôt regret it and vise versa. even if I choose one over the other I‚Äôd still take classes I want in the other major (like 2.007 And 6.141).

Does anyone know what the smash scene is like at MIT
Specifically for ultimate, is it mostly just freindlies and small weekly tourneys or is there a dedicated esports scene with a pr and/or coaches or a group of players that go to big tournaments? Also how many people play smash at MIT?
--------------------------------------------------
18.100P vs. 18.100Q
I'm trying to decide what version of analysis I should take next semester, and I'm really torn between 18.100P and 18.100Q. What level of "mathematical maturity" should one have before taking 18.100Q? Over the summer, I worked through a good amount of "How to Prove it" and over winter break I intend to spend an hour or two most days working through "Understanding Analysis". For those of you that have taken 18.100Q, what was your proof writing background like? Did you do well?
--------------------------------------------------
Thoughts on 4.02A/4.021 for people that aren‚Äôt course 4?
I‚Äôm a sophomore in course 2 with nothing to do this IAP, so I‚Äôm thinking about taking 4.02a. Anyone have thoughts on 4.02a/4.021 for people who aren‚Äôt course 4?
--------------------------------------------------
Dual MS degree for currently enrolled MS/PhD students? (specifically EECS)
Does anyone know if it's possible to petition for a dual MS degree in another department while being an enrolled MS/PhD student? For instance, being a Course 3 MS/PhD student and petitioning to earn a dual MS in Course 6 (EECS) along the way due to overlapping coursework. I know that EECS doesn't admit for terminal masters, but I have seen for example that it's quite popular in the Technology and Policy (TPP) MS program for students to earn a dual MS degree in EECS along the way if they were already a currently enrolled MS student in TPP. As stated [here](https://oge.mit.edu/gpp/degrees/masters/simultaneous-registration-for-two-masters-degrees/) and [here](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics-admissions/graduate-program/faqs#:~:text=MIT%20students%20who%20are%20enrolled,thesis%20of%20an%20interdisciplinary%20nature.) EECS does offer the dual MS, but I'm unsure if MS/PhD students can also petition for a dual MS in another department along the way or if anyone knows if this is possible. Thanks!

How hard is 14.01 A without any background in econ.
I am a freshman, and I plan to concentrate on economics  though I have no any background. Still, I have interest in econ (so that concentration is not for "technical hass") . How hard it will be to get an A from 14.01 with decent studying? FYI, I did 18.02 this semester and have pretty good math background.

IAP Question
First year masters student here. I‚Äôm wondering does anybody know what the course load is like for a IAP classes? Like should I expect taking 2 6 unit IAP classes to be as much work as taking one 12 unit class for a semester?

Also, how many units is a reasonable amount to take during IAP?
--------------------------------------------------
What's the stress culture like at MIT?
Also, how is failure treated there? Are people toxic/rate your worth by grades?  Is failure something kept secret or is it taken as an opportunity to grow? Are profs willing to help?

Hacking courses/clubs at MIT
Hello there. I am a freshman planning to pursue 6-3 and 18. I am also interested in hacking but only as a hobby (nothing black hat). I have general knowledge of kali tools and can write my own scripts in C and Python. Are there some courses or clubs that I can take to improve those abilities and have more fun?

Anyone go through an ADHD diagnosis during/post MIT?
I'm currently in the process now and am super hopeful this can help me... but  I'm particularly worried about being taken seriously/ explaining my struggles because from the outside I look like a huge success story with a big MIT stamp of approval. I feel like the deadlines, structure, and co-working/p-setting environment got me through MIT and now that I'm left to my own devices/schedule I'm a huge wreck. But explaining that cooperative  culture to a doc outside MIT when it's known for its rigorousness/percieved cut-throatedness I expect to be difficult. Looking for kind words/advice from anyone who's been through this?

Edit: words for clarity

Edit 2: Wanted to update everyone that my psychiatrist had basically no trouble accepting that I had ADHD and still made it through MIT. In fact, she said it was such a clear cut example that she ended up referring me before we'd completed the testing. There are good ones out there who can understand you even if you're not the "distractable young boy who did terrible in school". 

Edit3: If you're in the same boat, I suggest contacting S3 or MIT My Life Services for non-MIT support. MyLifeServices helped me find a psych that had availability in MIT's  network (even mid COVID). I worked with people at Commonwealth Psychology in the Newton Wellsley office (now LifeStance Health) and they were absolutely fantastic & said I was not the first MIT kid they'd seen. Big reccommend.

MIT missing semester course
I am a computer science major from another school and I am currently going through the MIT missing semester course on YouTube, which goes over how to use command line tools on Linux. At the end of each lecture, there are a set of exercises for students to learn those skills.

While the videos are really interesting to watch, I feel like they are hard to memorize in practice and are better as an introduction to these topics. Should I go over the exercises only when I need to use them, or is it better to do them after every lecture?

Some advice would be appreciated. Thank you!

Anyone in materials engineering doing projects with carbon nanotubes or graphene right now?

What math class do you think is a must take this spring?
So I‚Äôm relatively new to the math department but have a solid background in algebra/topology (18.725, 18.905). I noticed that there seem to be many part 1/2 sequences that start in the fall, so with that in mind: 

I was wondering what upper level course you feel is a must take this spring (open to analysis, algebra, topology, probability theory, whatever).
--------------------------------------------------
New residency requirement sprung on graduate students
Out of the blue, international graduate students were notified this week that they will not be paid in the Spring unless they are living in the US.  In some departments, all classes and advising will be online, but this does not matter.  Because this requirement did not exist in the Fall, there are students in other countries with long-term leases, children in schools, spouses with jobs, no visa, US bank account or arrangement for local housing, whose plans are suddenly upended. The text makes clear that this policy change is for bureaucratic convenience of MIT and not a mandate from the government.  Within MIT, the decision was apparently made without consulting the departments. You can imagine how many students are freaking out. 

The new policy is [https://covid-team2020.mit.edu/remote-appointments/](https://covid-team2020.mit.edu/remote-appointments/) but since that site is restricted to MIT users only, I copied relevant text below.

**Graduate Students**  
RA, TAs, and Fellows: ***Graduate students with RA, TA, or fellowship appointments in Spring 2021 are being asked to return/come to the U.S. by January 30, 2021, in order to maintain their appointments***.¬†A graduate student may be eligible to conduct their RA,TA, or fellowship appointment from abroad only if:

* Visa delays, travel restrictions, border closures, and other COVID-related factors prevent their travel to the U.S.;¬†
* The student or a member of the student‚Äôs household has been instructed by a medical provider not to travel to the U.S. for medical reasons; or
* The student is caring for a family member with COVID-19 or other illness.

If a graduate student with an RA, TA, or fellowship appointment is unable to return to/enter the U.S. for the above reasons, and they meet the other criteria listed below (see FAQ), the student should contact their graduate administrator who will submit an¬†[intake form](https://mit.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6txpJ8RUbGpbY9v)¬†for the student‚Äôs remote international appointment.

**These requests will be reviewed individually to determine what options, if any, may be available to the student. Therefore, any student who believes they will need to purse their RA, TA, or fellowship appointment from abroad in Spring 2021 should immediately begin working with their department/program.**

Hourly Paid Appointments: Graduate students are not permitted to have hourly-paid appointments from outside the U.S. during Spring 2021 term. Intake forms should not be submitted for these students.  


**Why is MIT changing its guidelines for remote student appointments conducted from outside the U.S.?**  
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, MIT has supported hundreds of students pursuing their appointments remotely from abroad. As we explained in our¬†[previous guidance and FAQs](https://covid-team2020.mit.edu/remote-appointments/), these remote international appointments pose a number of logistical, compliance, and financial challenges for both MIT and those working remotely abroad. To address these challenges, MIT set up a new process in May to review and facilitate these appointments on a temporary basis. The process was updated in August to include specific guidance for the Fall 2020 term.

MIT has reviewed and approved over 800 requests for students to pursue their appointments from outside the U.S. Many of these requests were for students who remained in the U.S at the start of the pandemic, but who wished to return home to pursue their studies and appointments in their home communities.

We are pleased that so many students were able to pursue their appointments this summer and fall from the locations that worked best for them. Unfortunately, given the increasing challenges posed by these international appointments‚Äîincluding the duration of many of these appointments, the fluid situation relating to the pandemic, and the relevant external guidance‚Äîwe need to modify our approach beginning with the Spring 2021 term.

My (over-complete) suggested course list for an aspiring ML student
18.01 single variable calculus

18.02 multivariable calculus

6.009 intro program design

6.004 intro EE (supplementary)

18.06 intro linear algebra

6.006 intro algorithms (supplementary)

6.031 intermediate program design (haven't personally taken yet and I'm told there's lots of busy work irl, but it's an important thing to learn)

\-- classes I'd recommend to someone with a solid CS base start here --

6.034 intuitions about ML (haven't personally taken, taught by Prof. Winston, not sure what it's like since then)

6.008 intro inference (haven't personally taken, but taught by Greg and Paulina whom I trust to teach a good class)

6.041 intro probability (really good, rigorous, hard class as of spring 2018, but I'm told they changed it so 6.436 might be a better option now)

6.046 intermediate algorithms (supplementary, super fun tho, reminds me why I got into CS)

18.065 linear algebra for ML (taught by Prof. Strang, who both literally and figuratively wrote the book, gives good intuitions and reviews the basics)

6.436 intro probability (again; grad, haven't taken, see note on 6.041)

6.867 classical ML to neural networks (grad, same kind of vibe as Murphy's ML book)

6.438 algorithms for inference (grad, sister class to 6.437 that's more approachable for CS students)

9.520 statistical learning methods (grad, changes content yearly, see CBMM youtube; this class in 2018 had the best explanation of GANs I've ever seen)

6.437 inference and information (grad, my favorite class, not on OCW iirc, one of my friends got a 2/30 on the 3 hour midterm worth 35% that had 3 questions; only Paulina, Greg, and Gauss truly understand this stuff)

6.172 performance engineering (supplementary, great content and projects, lots of stupid small stuff irl)

6.824 distributed systems (supplementary, well put together, but lectures are mostly just rehashing the readings; taught by rtm, who built the first internet worm)

6.803 seminar in ML (grad, legendary class taught by Prof. Winston, tried and failed to get in before he died; may he rest in peace, he truly made the world a better place)

Most are on OCW too I think. You can look at prereqs for a more complete picture, there's some overlap, some classes are taught better than others, start where you feel comfortable, skip what you know, midterms/finals are online for context.

For the confident, go backwards for trial by fire followed by intolerable boredom. Gets you good internships tho.

There's also a whole bunch of supplementary math and cognition classes I wish I had time to take.

6.009 Fundamentals of Programming
Hi all! Hope you are staying healthy with Covid persisting. 

I'm unable to pursue formal education at this time and trying to learn computer science on my own, mainly by going through MIT's open-courseware. It's been going well so far, and I've really been enjoying learning! I have been struggling for a while to find resources for 6.009, which is a course I am super excited to learn about! The lecture slides ([https://py.mit.edu/fall20](https://py.mit.edu/fall20)) are incomplete. I am curious if there are any available resources available that I am missing (lectures would be phenomenal!).  


From what I understand this course is partially a split from a prior 6.005 (available on edx), with some modifications and now taught in python.

Thank you and stay safe! :)
--------------------------------------------------
Questions about requirements for Econ classes
Hi! I'm a frosh interested in majoring in Course 6-14, but I had some confusion when trying to figure out what classes I should be taking this spring. In particular:

Should/can I petition out of the 14.01 requirement if I received a 5 on the AP Micro exam? I've heard about some people who've done it but I wanted to know if people thought it was a good idea? (I'd try to take 14.19 this semester if I went through w/ it if that helps.)

Also, is 18.600 usually a viable substitution for classes with a 6.041 or 14.30 prereq? I know 14.12 has 6.041B as a prereq (although that class doesn't exist anymore) and 14.32 requires 14.30. Since 6-14 allows you to choose one of 14.30/18.600/6.041 but also requires 14.32, I was wondering if there was any flexibility with 14.32's prereq?

Thanks in advance!
--------------------------------------------------
Can someone explain what the MIT media lab is?
 I am an undergrad who is not from MIT, applying for a PhD program at MIT. I am applying to EECS, and one of the professors who interests me is in the MIT media lab, but he does EECS work. Can I work under Media lab faculty while in the EE department or do I need to get a degree in media? I can't find this information anywhere

Thanks
--------------------------------------------------
For 6-3: why doesn't MIT require Linear Algebra or Differential Equations in the curriculum, especially when MIT 6-3 requires 6.034 or 6.036?

UROP while taking classes during IAP
How feasible would it be to UROP full time (40 hrs a week) while also taking 12 units of classes? I really want to take two classes but I might have to drop one if its too much of a time commitment. Has anyone done this and how did it go for you?
--------------------------------------------------
6.046 vs 6.045? Why is 6.046 more popular?
6.046 seems to be the more typical default when it comes to fulfilling the 6-3 degree requirement. Is 6.046 more popular because the algorithms in this class are just super useful/necessary for industry jobs? Or is it just a thing where more people naturally want to learn 046 material instead of 045 material?

M1 Mac for course 6?
So my current laptop is starting to die on me and I was thinking of getting a new laptop and the new m1 chip MacBook Pro looks interesting. I was wondering if any of you who are majoring in course 6 knows if there would be any potential compatibility issues for software in class? 

Just for reference I‚Äôm a freshman and as of now I‚Äôm leaning towards just CS but I want to explore more of the hardware side of EE so I could major in that instead. This semester we used Spyder for 6.0001/2. Is there any other software in course 6 that would have compatibility issues and be a dealbreaker?

Which Econ class should I take this spring?
Hello. I‚Äôm a freshman taking 14.01 micro and the course has been very fun and exciting so far. I‚Äôm interested in both 14-2 and 6-14. Should I try some macro by taking 14.02 this spring? Or should I try something else? 

Also what are the best Econ classes at MIT I should take at some point?

MITES vs MOSTEC
So I'm currently not a student at MIT, but am really interested in the college and plan to apply next year. One way I wanted to gauge my interest in MIT was to apply for MITES, which I heard about after looking around the internet. I was looking forward to the application this month, but apparently, the event has been canceled for 2021, which really sucks. I am aware of another program, MOSTEC, which is still being offered. I'm planning on applying to this program because I believe it will still serve as a valuable experience, but I don't know the nitty-gritty details of the program. So, I was wondering:

&#x200B;

\- Are there any notable differences between MITES and MOSTEC (i.e is one harder to get in than the other, is the curriculum different, etc)?

SLOAN AUTOMOTIVE LABORATORY .

Questions about Spring 2021 Arrangements
So despite the information provided by MIT, I still have some glaring questions regarding Spring 2021 living arrangements. I‚Äôve tried emailing housing but I haven‚Äôt received responses. I thought I‚Äôd ask some on here instead. 

> How does one form a pod? 

- Do the pod members have to be on the same floor, or be in some proximity to one another? 

- When do we form pods? Before or after arriving on campus? (Alternatively, is this Information supposed to be given at some point) 

- How do we go about forming a pod if we haven‚Äôt been on campus yet? 


> Classes... 

- How many classes will have an in person component? Specifically, as a math major, will any classes have an in person component? 

- How does social distancing work in the classroom? 



> Recreation 

- Are members of the same pod allowed to book times for different MIT rec centers? 


> Also, where can we get more info on this? I feel like I‚Äôd like more information before making a housing decision.

Choosing between 14-2 and 6-14. (Freshman)
Hello! 

I have a friend who is trying to decide between these two majors. They are worried 6-14 doesn‚Äôt have enough focus on Econ (this friend loved 14.01), but they are also worried that 14-2 will be hard to get a job with, and they don‚Äôt know if 14-2 will have enough CS. So, they‚Äôre wondering if anyone has advice or simply insight as to which major to choose. Any information is appropriated. 

Thank you!!!

mental health in grad dorms
I can only speak for my experience in grad dorms: when will MIT Residence Services stop aggregating and collecting data via surveys and actually put student concerns into action? (re: training staff as first responders in the most basic sense, including Heads of House, front desk workers, these new security guards)...... suicidal ideation rates on the increase here and a group of us have sent sooooo many emails requesting new policies and directions after two students (that we know of) almost lost their lives in the past 8 months here and INSIDE the dorms.... emails regarding Zoom yoga, meditation, and resources at MIT Medical are nice and all, but the "community" promises made by Residence and Dorm officials are nil. If nothing changes, nothing changes. Things progress, they worsen. We're worried.

Info about Baker 1 West

I saw from this doc:

"1 West: This floor is notable for consisting entirely of freshman - without a particular preference for a sport. Historically, it‚Äôs known for being a wild party floor, for reasons I shall not disclose publicly. If you ask around, you‚Äôll probably hear some interesting things that have gone down on this floor ;)"

What's this all about? If you can't say here, can you pm me please, I'm interested!

Laptop vs Desktop for engineering?
So I'm a high school senior hoping to get into MIT and I plan on studying mechanical engineering. I don't know if this is a more general education or college specific question, but anyways. I plan on building a new (primarily gaming) PC before I go to college. Should I save money for a cheap laptop as well? I will definitely need at least a Chromebook to take notes and such. Or, conversely, should I merely buy a competent gaming laptop instead? I know engineering requires a decent amount of computer horsepower, but do you need the computing power when your not at your dorm? 
I apologise for the long winded rambling nature of my question, but I hope you get the nature of what I'm asking.
Thanks!

Are pods filled up automatically?
Hello! 

I recently filled out a form to go back to campus. My friend mad I put each other as pod buddies. We were wondering if our pod will automatically get filled with other people, or if it will just be the two of us? Can we choose? 

Thank you!

Single/Double occupancy confusion
On the residence application form it states: "While most students will live one-to-a-room, two students may be housed together in double rooms‚Äã." As most of the dorm rooms in many of the residences are not singles, would this imply that double rooms will be opened up for one person occupancy. If so, is the decision process behind assignment to said rooms done on an intra-house basis?¬†

&#x200B;

Also on the vlog MIT sent out about on campus life, there was a mention of "dingles" -- doubles converted to singles. 

&#x200B;

Is this expected to be a widespread thing at MIT this spring? And if so, how is assignment to a dingle decided?
--------------------------------------------------
Rough cutoffs for 6.031?
Since drop date is fast approaching, I need to decide which class I should put on PE/NE, if any. Right now my only candidate would be 6.031, so I just wanted to know if people who've taken it could give me a good idea as to what's an A, B, C, etc.
--------------------------------------------------
Is moving on campus in the Spring worth it?
Today is the last day to submit the housing application form, and I am still undecided on whether it is even worth it to move to campus. It seems like moving to campus is a significantly more expensive way to attend the same zoom lectures. Moreover, given that campus would still be quarantined, it does not seem likely that there would be much if any social interaction outside of the small group of people I would be living with. 

With that being said, I am trying to make the most informed decision as possible and equally consider all options. What do you guys see as the benefits of moving on campus? What makes moving to campus worth it to you?
--------------------------------------------------
How do I even form a pod
Hi, I‚Äôm a sophomore. Due to certain circumstances I couldn‚Äôt live on campus my freshman year until spring. Then covid happened. I don‚Äôt have any close friends at MIT yet and I still feel quite distant from the social culture of MIT. 

To people who have information about pods (e.g. those who were on campus this fall or have heard some news) can I reasonably expect to be able to join a pod? 

I understand that more information on pods would be available once I arrive on campus, but by that point my housing decision will be set in stone. I don‚Äôt want to have a situation where I‚Äôm entirely isolated (without a pod) on campus.
--------------------------------------------------
Housing Form Error?
My housing form just reverted my choices and put all the dorms in alphabetical order (Baker 1st, EC 2nd, etc.).  Just wanted to let people know so that they can check and get the right dorm rankings, also wanted to see if anyone else had the same problem.

Question about the football field
I live in Somerville, so I'm kinda close to the field (I'm still in high school) and I was able to go this summer, but now there's some annoying people behind a table saying I need my ID (was never like that before this year). I noticed last saturday they were gone. Are they always gone over the weekends? Thanks
--------------------------------------------------
Are the PACE clusters at MIT still operational?
I've seen a couple old sites that seem to reference them, but I was wondering if they still exist in the MechE or CS departments. If not, what other systems replaced them?
--------------------------------------------------
Are pod sizes going up to 8, or staying at 6?
Hey folks, I'm curious if pods are gonna go up to size 8 (based on the fact that the housing form now accepts staples of 8). The newest email said pods will stay at 6, which seems absurd to me since staples are 8.

OK so I'm an undergrad at UChicago right now and I'm applying to MIT for grad school, and I've been researching the university I've been seeing mentions of the brass rat and the myths and legends around the class ring
And I'm wondering  How pervasive they are within the student culture. And you have to be an undergrad to get one or to graduate students also receive the brass rat ?

I'm sorry if this question sounds a bit foolish ,but I am  Genuinely curious about the importance the brass rat has to students and alumni of MIT.

How to express concerns about a class (7.06) that does not have a piazza forum on which to do so anonymously + rant
Full disclosure: I am on the A/B boundary for this class so I guess bias may play a part in this but not majorly. 

Question: For other classes in prior semesters (e.g. 8.02) there have been methods to anonymously express concerns about a class through the piazza forum. I (and I believe other students also (cf. below)) wish to anonymously express my concerns about 7.06, or to express my concerns in a safe setting. Are there ways in which to do this? 

&#x200B;

Rant: In my opinion, the tests (93% of the grade) in 7.06 are horribly made. For those not in the class this semester, the questions are extremely vague but graded via a hyper-specific rubric while simultaneously docking for any extraneous information (in whatever way they define that based on the rubric, because again, the questions are very vague). For each of the 7.06 exams so far, I think they were content wise easy, and feel like I did well on them. However, each time, I was hit with an extra minus 10-15% for obscure/(extremely) nitpicky reasons. 

I believe students have complained in class about this before, as there was an email from the instructors with a proposed "solution" to this problem: to ask clarification questions about vaguely phrased problems DURING the exam via a google forum. In addition to the fact that the onus should not be on the students to design questions well (and that it can take up time that is supposed to be used on solving the exam), this is also unhelpful, as sometimes questions ask about something specific but have supposed rubric "answers" containing what I would consider entirely extraneous information. Basically, we don't know what questions to ask about the badly phrased problems because while taking the test they seem normal, only when comparing them with the rubric do they become respectively vague, unintuitive, or unclear.\* \*with respect to what the rubric was looking for 

I have for a little bit now stopped studying the biology for this class as much/attending class and instead focused on trying to figure out what the instructors want from me on tests (this is something I used to do in high school, and I hate that I have to do it now) -- this has actually helped my grade go up, not down. Singlehandedly this class has made me want to change majors as, although I love biology, I don't feel like focusing more on "test-taking" than learning in the future. I didn't have this issue in 7.05 or 7.03 and hope 7.06 is a one-off.

Is MIT food really that bad?
I know we might be moving in spring semester, but as a freshman I've never had a chance to try the food. Is MIT food as bad as everyone makes it seem? Or does this largely depend on which dining hall you eat at? Are there also really no good food places in Boston? I saw an earlier subreddit say there aren't really any good boba places but my diet revolves around boba...

For the people that do despise the food, what do you do to get around this? Cook for yourself every day? Eat out every day? Seems unrealistic to be able to do that but I'm curious.

Need help with a class project on COVID-19 and School Safety
Hey everyone,

So I am conducting a group project for one of my classes and we are trying to look at the perceived safety of fourteen Boston colleges (such as MIT) in the hopes of determining whether or not reopenings have been considered safe and effective.

If anyone has the time, I would really appreciate it if you could fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/D9FPvhx4opbonF9T8) so we can get the most accurate representation of each school's reopening. It would take at most 5 minutes!

Decision regarding collaboration with Saudi Aramco - thanks and bye!
"September 03, 2020

Dear Faculty Colleagues,

We write to let you know about a decision regarding collaborations  with Aramco, a founding member of the MIT Energy Initiative. After  thorough review and consultations within MIT and Aramco, Aramco‚Äôs  membership in MITEI will not be renewed, and new sponsored engagements  between MIT and Aramco will not be considered at this time.

Within MIT, this outcome was informed by extensive consultations and  community input over the past year and a half, and by specific  recommendations from the [International Advisory Committee (IAC)](https://facultygovernance.mit.edu/committee/international-advisory-committee), input from the [Ad Hoc Faculty Committee on Guidelines for Outside Engagements](https://facultygovernance.mit.edu/committee/ad-hoc-faculty-committee-guidelines-outside-engagements#:~:text=The%20Ad%20Hoc%20Committee%20on%20Guidelines%20for%20Outside%20Engagements%20will,MIT%20community%20during%20Spring%202020.&text=Several%20members%20of%20the%20ad,ensure%20coordination%20in%20their%20work), and review by the Senior Risk Group. A full description of this process appeared in the May issue of the [Faculty Newsletter](https://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/325/lester.html).

Aramco has been a valued research partner for MIT. It is a technical  leader in many areas of engineering and science, and it has provided  many valuable research opportunities for MIT faculty and students which  have contributed to advances in fundamental energy science and  technology. Our researchers have also forged productive individual  working relationships with their Aramco colleagues.

We appreciate the thoughtful consideration that has been given to  this matter by faculty committees and groups and by individual members  of the community.

Sincerely,

Richard K. Lester  
 Associate Provost

Maria T. Zuber  
 Vice President for Research"

Should I Course 16 if 6.0002 is giving me a really hard time?
I am a freshman who is interested in Course 16, but knowing that there is some CS in Course 16 scares me considering how much of a hard time I‚Äôm having with 6.0002. The first P-Set is a nightmare, and even though I did great on 6.0001, I have no idea how this second part will turn out. I would appreciate your opinion.

18c meng?
I'm a freshman who's currently thinking of doing 18c since I like math a lot but also eecs, but also I'm pretty interested in the meng program. however, on the site it says it's only for 6-1/2/3 majors, but also I saw someone online say they actually knew someone in 18c who got into the program by fulfilling the requirements (only thing is that you can't double 6 and 18c). Do you guys know if this is legit/viable/a good idea or should I look into switching to 6-3? Thanks :)

What‚Äôs campus like rn?
Hi all, I‚Äôm in my last year of undergrad and applying to grad school at MIT for next fall (forgive me if I‚Äôm breaking any sub rules, this is not my side of town). I was snooping on this sub to try and get a campus vibe (you know, as you do), and I was hoping someone could answer a couple questions
1) how the heck do your course numbers work??? I‚Äôm used to like HIST101 or ME309 but you guys are throwing decimals around?
2) how is MIT handling COVID? I gather some groups are on campus but some aren‚Äôt?

Edit: undergrad at another university, to clarify
--------------------------------------------------
Do difficult engineering courses at MIT (ie: Fluid Dynamics, Algorithms, Aerodynamics, etc) have averages in the 80s-90s?
I know in other universities, the averages for engineering classes are either a failing average or just barely passing class averages. How is it compared to at MIT? Since MIT has top students, are the averages usually in the 90s and the department must curve down the grades for most students?
--------------------------------------------------
For those who took more than 3 years to graduate as transfers...
What is your final year called? like if your first three years are Sophomore, Junior, and Senior, what is your final year called on your transcript? Do employers look at an additional year and think, "wow, how come this dude needed an additional year?"

MIT and others being investigated for not reporting foreign ties.
One university, identifiable as MIT, held around $11 million in contracts and agreements with Chinese company Huawei since 2013, the Education Department reported.

Cornell University initially failed to report to U.S. authorities more than $1.2 billion in foreign funds it has received in recent years, including $760 million related to its campus in Qatar and about $1 million in contracts from Chinese telecom company Huawei Technologies Co., the U.S. Education Department indicated in its latest report on schools and foreign contracts.

The names of Cornell and other universities are redacted in a report the department released Tuesday, but are identifiable based on other details provided in the report and related correspondence by the department with the schools.

The 34-page report provides an update to a broad investigation the Education Department undertook last year into whether U.S. universities are appropriately reporting all foreign contracts and gifts that total more than $250,000 in one year. It isn‚Äôt illegal to take such funds, but universities are obligated to disclose them under a statute that is decades old but hasn‚Äôt been vigorously enforced in past years.

The department said Tuesday it planned to condition access to participation in federal student-loan programs on compliance with foreign-funding obligations.

The government has expressed concern that foreign money may come with strings attached, provide foreign governments improper access to sensitive research or limit academic freedom in some programs.

‚ÄúU.S. institutions are technological treasure troves where leading and internationally competitive fields, such as nanoscience, are booming. For too long, these institutions have provided an unprecedented level of access to foreign governments and their instrumentalities in an environment lacking transparency and oversight by the industry, the Department, and our partner agencies,‚Äù the Education Department said in its report.

More on U.S. Reviews of Foreign Funding

Education Department Investigating Harvard, Yale Over Foreign Funding (Feb. 13)
The Justice Department has been cracking down on violations of a law that requires lobbyists for foreign nationals and governments to publicly disclose that work. A top Republican fundraiser pleaded guilty on Tuesday to a related charge.

Education Department investigators found that ‚Äúmany large and well-resourced institutions of higher education have aggressively pursued and accepted foreign money,‚Äù while failing to comply with reporting obligations, according to the new report.

‚ÄúEvidence suggests institutional decision-making is generally divorced from any sense of obligation to our taxpayers or concern for our American national interests, security, or values,‚Äù the report added.

The report said a school, identifiable as Georgetown University, has worked with the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, ‚Äúderived $2,360,807‚Äù from an arrangement that demonstrated ‚Äúsignificant intermingling‚Äù with China, and supported an academic exchange with Communist officials through the central committee‚Äôs Party School.

A Georgetown spokeswoman said the school‚Äôs tax filings show a nearly identical dollar amount in expenditures in the region, but not gifts or contracts from foreign entities, and that the details in the report were ‚Äúa bit puzzling to us.‚Äù

U.S. universities have generally defended their international collaborations and said the agency‚Äôs reporting requirements were unclear.

A Cornell spokesman acknowledged the university‚Äôs past errors in reporting and said it had undertaken significant efforts since July 2019 to file accurate disclosures of the foreign funds.

Since 2019, the Education Department has opened investigations into a dozen top universities including Harvard University and Yale University, finding that U.S. universities failed to report at least $6.5 billion in such funds.

The new report details information the agency received from Georgetown, Texas A&M University, Cornell, Rutgers University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Maryland. The other schools under investigation are continuing to provide information or have yet to provide documents, the report said.

One school, identifiable as Cornell, admitted that it failed to document its institution in Qatar in previous reports to the department, and said it was dumbfounded about how to explain the error, the report said. The university has a branch of its medical school in the Gulf country.

Multiple schools also belatedly reported receiving millions of dollars from Huawei, the report said, referring to the tech giant whose equipment U.S. national security officials have warned could be used for espionage, which the company denies.

American universities largely stopped taking Huawei funds by 2018 based on the U.S. concerns, but many top schools had previously entered into extensive contracts with the company, the report said. The university identifiable as MIT, for example, held around $11 million in contracts and agreements with Huawei since 2013, ranging from research agreements to donations for specific projects and programs, the report said.

Anyone planning on taking 6.856 Randomized Algorithms next spring?
I'm an undergrad at Northeastern and I'd like to learn more about randomized algorithms before grad school. I'm considering trying to 'take' (ie. audit and do the homework for) 6.856 Randomized Algorithms, but one of my professors who took the class in his undergrad told me it would be abhorrently difficult and that I shouldn't go in without knowing people I can work on the problem sets with. 

would anyone here planning on taking the course in the spring be willing to chat about their level of preparation? and to then potentially collaborate once the course starts and if I register? 

It's a graduate course so talking to other undergrads would be especially helpful.

Undergrad summers if planning on grad school?
I‚Äôm a sophomore doing virtual MIT right now, and I was looking for more people‚Äôs input on how best my summer would be spent this year, under a covid-vaccinated hypothesis. Most of my friends are seeking industry/corporate internships, and I‚Äôve been thinking of applying to a few. But I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôll want to get a phd, and have some experience working a desk job which I disliked. I suppose I could look for research internships in different labs, but I am currently doing a UROP (continued from frosh summer) which I really enjoy and I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was kosher to research somewhere else for the summer before returning. If there are people either in grad school rn or planning on it, it‚Äôd be helpful to hear how y‚Äôall chose to spend your summers. Thanks!

What to do
Sorry to bring down the mood but I've been having the hardest time here. I'm failing more classes than passing and it's only halfway into the freshmen fall semester. I study pretty efficiently (I'm sure I can improve upon this but it has worked for the most part in the past) but I still get C/D/Fs on my tests. Recently one of my profs showed a test distribution and I  scored in the bottom 1%.

It probably doesn't help that I grew up in the typical Chinese-American family, applied here for my parents, and admitted for my parents. I really wanted to study classics at Berkeley for law school (I live in NorCal), but even aside from my parents, people told me I was stupid to turn down MIT for a public state school. Every time I try to talk to my associate advisor it ends up in me bluffing and saying how excited I am for the potential that this school offers, but in reality, I can't find any reason to go on. I feel like I basically ruined my future.

Has anyone else dealt with this? I know that online school probably changes the experience by a great margin, but I'm not sure if this will change regardless of campus. A lot of people tell me that "you're not the only one" and "there are people doing worse than you," and I try to take this to heart, but it means very little when I'm actually doing worse than 99% of students in my class.

Sorry again :(

Double Major in Aero/Astro and Physics with a minor in Material Science and Engineering?
Hi everyone,

So I‚Äôm a current freshman here at MIT and just wanted to ask a question. With me wanting to double major in Aerospace Engineering and Physics to try to get both a systems Engineering and technical science background in my undergrad (but also because I love all of it) and after seeing how other students do it successfully without dying, its something I‚Äôm pretty set on committing to here at MIT. 

However, I started looking into the Material Science Department here and after poking my head into some of the research labs (MIT Nano) and letting my love for chemistry come out, I‚Äôm now considering maybe minoring in Mat Sci along with my double major (because I love Aero/Astro and Physics a lot more).

The way I‚Äôm looking at it would be if it gets too stressful and it‚Äôs not fun anymore I‚Äôd drop it, but what do you guys think about actually trying to do that? I thought it would be awesome to not only get Engineering education, but also a good knowledge base in chemistry and physics as well! 

Would this be a great thing to enter industry with or do you guys think it wouldn‚Äôt be worth it? 

*Note: I am trying to have a social life and I don‚Äôt want to do this just to flex. I just saw it as a great way to combine all my interests into a great undergrad experience. Since my concentrations in Aero/Astro and Physics would be robotics and propulsion, a Mat Sci minor made sense :) 

Any input would be appreciated!

6-3 vs 6-2?
Hi guys,

I am hoping that someone can share their insights on majoring in pure cs (6-3) vs eecs (6-2)? If you were deciding between the two, what helped push you towards one or the other? I am definitely more interested in the CS side of things, specifically in AI, but I am also interested in EE and robotics (I know there's an overlap with CS here too), just not to the same degree as CS. 

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks and stay safe!

Summer research for non-MIT undergrad
Hello, I‚Äôm a sophomore at Stanford studying CS and the time has come again for me to figure out what to do with my summer. I‚Äôve spent each one before doing research, and I‚Äôd like to keep doing so - I‚Äôm interested in everything CS-adjacent, including projects that apply computational methods to non-technical subjects. I was wondering if there‚Äôs any kind of program or possibility for a non-MIT student to do summer research at MIT. Would I email professors? Is there a research opportunity already set up for situations like this? Any advice will help.

A month of classes has gone by...
and I have nothing to show for it. It seems like all I've done since I joined has been watching lectures and struggling with p-sets. I haven't gotten to know anyone or had any enjoyable experiences. I was so excited to be joining such an amazing university and to get the opportunity to learn and do so many new things, but MIT has been nothing short of a complete disappointment. Each day feels like a meaningless chore...

Curious About COURSE 11 and 11.6
Hi there, hope you're safe and healthy.

I am interested in the areas of urbanism and public policy.  I'm considering urban planning as my major for undergraduate studies. I have been going through MIT's DUSP website and it looks really good. I wanted to learn more, from an actual student. 

I would like to chat with you and get to know more. 

Let me know if I can PM you.

Thanks.

Chances of an On-Campus Spring Semester?
Hey guys, current freshman here. It's been really difficult for me learning 100% remotely and not getting to meet any of my classmates in person. I've been cautiously optimistic about coming to campus in the Spring but I'm curious about what you guys think is going to happen.

What's MITs opinion on football?
This might *technically* be an admissions question but eh. I'm an aspiring MIT student and would like to play football if I am admitted. I know it's division III so not exactly high stakes, but I was just wondering what's the general campus consensus. Do people go to games? Do people give a crap about football at all? It's not really going to affect my application but I was just curious.

How to seek out clubs to join this year
I feel odd browsing through the club catalog and cold emailing clubs that may or may not be active due to COVID. How do I figure out which clubs are/are not open and seek to join them this year?
--------------------------------------------------
Notion?
Has anyone here used notion? A lot of people have recommended it to me but I want to make sure it's actually helping and not just busy work. I already use a (albeit messy) planner where I just jot down what I need to get done, but if Notion for students is worth it I definitely want to look into it (especially because it's free)!

6.881 Robotic Manipulation
I'm not an MIT student but the lectures for the class are being uploaded to youtube. I've been trying to do the assignments. For the most part I want to say that I'm getting the hang of it, but does anyone know where I can find the solutions? Definitely need to check my work.   


Also, if anyone has any other supplemental resources that would help in 6.881 that would be terrific!
--------------------------------------------------
Applying to MIT as a lit major?
I am planning to apply to MIT as a transfer student for fall admission (Literature major and Entrepreneurship & Innovation minor). I really love both departments, as well as the  writing department, which has some of the best creative writing classes I‚Äôve seen.

I‚Äôm not a science/math person. I like science (math less so) and have never struggled with it, but literature is my thing. I really don‚Äôt have much of a background in science at all, except for the fact hat I did do quite well in an international science thing in 2018 - but that‚Äôs it.

Perhaps this is crazy to consider applying? I am cross registered at a class at MIT currently and I really love the class. I feel like I would like MIT, so I‚Äôm just trying to gauge whether this is a wild idea. 

I feel like applying to MIT as a freshman for literature is one thing, but perhaps as a transfer with my lack of science / math background, it‚Äôs a bit weird?

Anyone have any thoughts on this?

anyone here took 8.334?
Hi,

I was wondering your experience with the course, is it survivable almost 0 statistical physics knowledge. Also, are there any resources you can suggest.

Thanks

Wear your Mask or else!!
Dear Assistant Dean, AO, or HR Partner,

As part of its pandemic policies, MIT issued a Return to Work on Campus policy, detailing the safety requirements for being on campus, such as completing the daily health attestation and the wearing of face coverings.

To aid in making quick and consistent responses to alleged violations of the Return to Work on Campus policy, MIT will follow a new process, summarized below. This new process (Touchstone login required) applies to allegations against faculty and staff; a similar expedited Committee on Discipline process is in place for allegations against students.

The key provisions are:

Expedited review process

All complaints of alleged violations of the Return to Work on Campus policy are forwarded to the Manager of Institutional Compliance at covidcompliance@mit.edu.
The Manager of Institutional Compliance, in consultation with the OGC and others, will work with the DLC to find facts and appropriately respond.
The alleged violator will be informed and given an opportunity to respond.
Decision making

Low-level violations: DLC will determine appropriate response and/or sanction.
Other violations:
By faculty, other academic, postdoctoral, or research staff: Provost or VP for Research, in consultation with the school dean, will determine response/sanctioning.
By other staff: VP for HR will determine response/sanctioning.
Guidelines for Response/Sanctions

The decision maker ‚Äì the DLC, Provost, VP for Research, or VP for Human Resources ‚Äì will refer to the following guidelines when determining the response/sanctions. That said, each case is unique, and these guidelines are not prescriptive; they are intended to offer a basis from which to make a decision about a case. The decision-maker should consider the totality of the circumstances, including aggravating and mitigating factors, when determining sanctions.

 

Type of Violation

Potential Outcome

First-time face covering

Written reminder of policy, and warning that additional violation of this requirement could result in discipline.

 

First time ‚Äúlow level‚Äù

Disciplinary written warning.

Second time ‚Äúlow level‚Äù

OR

First time ‚Äúmedium level‚Äù

One-day disciplinary suspension without pay or access.

Repetition of above categories and
‚Äúhigh level‚Äù violations
Five-day disciplinary suspension without pay, or termination of employment. If individual is a tenured faculty member, referral to Provost for appropriate sanction.

 

KEY:

Types of ‚Äúlow-level‚Äù violations: one-time face covering or social distancing violation.
Types of ‚Äúmedium-level‚Äù violations: one-time access to building without approved access, failure to test, or second incident of a failure to wear a face covering.
Types of ‚Äúhigh-level‚Äù violations: violating quarantine, repeated violations of the above categories.
 

If you have any questions, please contact your Human Resources Officer or me.

Do MIT students end up in consulting and finance a lot?
I've seen and known quite a few people from MIT, from BS to PhD, pursue a career in consulting and quant after graduation. They don't work in tech anymore. Is it a thing in Boston? I live in California and a majority of students from Berkeley and Stanford have jobs in big tech companies.

Time management
Hello, frosh here. 

I'm finding it terribly difficult to manage all my classes as well as a sleep schedule, workout routine, etc. The problem sets and homework are taking really long, and I've pulled two all-nighters last week just to finish homework. 

Is this normal? Will it get easier, as this is only my freshman year? I am considering dropping out of a class to lighten my load but my heaviest classes (in terms of coursework) are required regardless. The impostor syndrome is definitely kicking in, and I'm sure other freshmen are also struggling a bit as it's currently the transition from high school to college, but I definitely didn't imagine college to be this difficult. I normally play the piano daily and spend a lot of time reading, but I haven't touched my piano or a book since last week. If you're also frosh, how is first semester going for you? If you're an upperclassman, how did you deal with it?
--------------------------------------------------
Anyone here take 2.165?
I was curious if anyone here has taken 2.165 (Robotics), and if so, what was your experience like? Is it survivable without much prior exposure to control theory? I haven't been able to find out much about the class other than [this website](http://web.mit.edu/2.165/www/index.html) from 2009.
--------------------------------------------------
Pset partner imposter syndrome
So I‚Äôm taking a graduate maths course at the moment but am not a graduate student. As someone relatively new to this sort of thing, I feel it would be beneficial to have a pset partner (through Sutherland‚Äôs website).  

However, I feel that the other students in the class have a more formal background than me and that I‚Äôd be a hindrance to the person I got matched up with. As someone who hasnever had a pset partner before, I also find the whole pset partner thing a bit mysterious. 

Should I still ‚Äúapply‚Äù for a pset partner despite these concerns? Any advice?
--------------------------------------------------
Frosh wanting to Winter ASE out of 8.01.
I‚Äôm a freshman who enrolled in 8.01, but I‚Äôm realizing the class is too easy. I was wondering if it would be a good idea to drop it and rake the winter ASE for it instead. I have plenty of experience with 8.01 thanks to Interphase EDGE.  My only concern is what score I should get to pass with an A. If anyone did this during their freshman or ya helpful ASE grading information, I would appreciate to know. 

Peace.

A different kind of welcome: Fall 2020 Covid policies
To: Off-Campus Graduate Students  
From: Suzy M. Nelson, Vice President and Dean for Student Life  
Sent: Monday, September 7, 2020 12:00  
Subject: A different kind of welcome: Fall 2020 Covid policies
 
YOU NEED TO KNOW: off-campus event prohibition; expedited disciplinary process for Covid policy violations; success depends on all of us!

Dear graduate students living off campus,

This is an unusual fall semester as MIT manages a pandemic, and the United States and countries around the world deal with the mounting toll of Covid cases.  Against this backdrop, there is continued unrest in cities across the country in the wake of police violence, systemic inequity, and the deaths of too many Black Americans. Further exacerbating these situations are natural disasters in the country's southern and western regions and a contentious national election.

To all of you anxious about any of these issues, know that MIT is here for you. Please reach out if you need to talk with someone.

MIT's plan for moving forward during the pandemic is guided by science and common sense. As I detail in a message I sent to graduate students living on campus, life at MIT is different now. But, if we work together and adhere to and have patience with Covid policies--both from MIT and in the communities where you live and work now--we can meet the challenges ahead.

Events, parties, and gatherings off campus. Don't organize or attend off-campus events, parties, or gatherings until further notice--they are a leading cause of Covid hotspots on college campuses. MIT will take swift disciplinary action in response to violations of MIT Covid policies through an expedited Committee on Discipline process. Students who attend or host off-campus parties, events, or gatherings may face disciplinary action including potential suspension or loss of future campus access.

Campus Access. Students living off-campus who have not been granted official access to MIT facilities through Covid Pass for academic and research purposes may not be on campus or in campus buildings at any time. Students who do have official access through Covid Pass may use academic and research facilities they are cleared to enter, DAPER indoor and outdoor facilities (with a valid membership), and designated outdoor common areas in groups no larger than the posted occupancy. Only current MIT Housing residents may enter the Student Center and use its foodservice facilities. This chart may help clarify who has access to campus facilities. 

Additional Policies and Updates

As you can see, we take student health, wellness, and safety seriously. Please review The Mind and Hand Book, which contains essential information on standards of behavior and student life policies. Other important policies include:

  - MIT's community standards such as the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act statement;
  - Discrimination, harassment, and Title IX resources that help make our campus safe; and
  - MIT's policy against hazing to support a safe and welcoming environment for all.

The success of the semester depends on every one of us! 

The Institute's decision to stick with our reopening plan is grounded in our confidence that every MIT community member will rise to the challenge.

Our plan for the fall and beyond is being put to the test. Working together, we can pass it with flying colors.

Best,  
Suzy

Juggling by the beach.
I'm going to be meeting today at 4 at magazine beach (to juggle) in the spot indicated by my mouse cursor below:

**SOME RULES THO:**

* No prop sharing. (I know teaching new people is a lot of whats fun about juggling club but it's just not safe (I will have at least 1-2 sets of clean balls in case someone wants to learn, but after they are dirtied I'm putting them away for disinfection later.)
* No passing. (I feel like this goes under no prop-sharing, but still I wanna be safe).
* We're keeping it under 25 people, DM me if you're going to show up so I can make sure that we **do not** have too many RSVPs.
* **we are going to be following all of the state mandates and health guidelines.**

Just so everyone knows now, there are **NO PLANS** to attempt to move this indoors when it gets cold.  


Edit: went home, just me and mi fiance, wie'll be back next week as long as it's nice out\~!

Insurance that covers ADHD medications for a foreign student?
I will be interning at the Harvard-MIT HST starting February for six months.  I have been on Methylphenidate for the past two years for ADHD.  I was wondering what insurance would cover it? Also how much would it cost per month?

18.03 ASE Finals Week Fall Term
On math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/first/advanced.php , it lists ASE Dates for orientation 2020, IAP, and Spring 2021 but does not mention finals week during fall. Does this mean there are no math ASEs during finals week this fall, or that there are no restrictions on normally scheduled ASEs?

Going back home country for online courses and discussion
In the interaction with professors, it seems that almost all of them intend to do everything online. Besides, it is hard to access department building now. As a result, if ones feel like staying at their home country could help them acquire more resources easier (like printing, internet or others), could they go back to their country recently?

I am one of those thinking about it, since currently (I have come back but) I don't think coming back to Cambridge could really make any of my task to be proceeded better (building off, no in-person discussion, why not just online at home?). So is this idea feasible now? (having consulted with iOS advisors, but not get replies yet)
--------------------------------------------------
Extension to speed up mitx?
Is there any way to watch my mitx physics videos on double speed? It only goes up to 1.5. Maybe a chrome extension?
--------------------------------------------------
Since clubs aren't meeting.
I'll be holding meetings of The Brick Street jugglers at Magazine beach.^(Edit: on Sundays lol.)

**SOME RULES THO:**

* No prop sharing. (I know teaching new people is a lot of whats fun about juggling club but it's just not safe)
* No passing. (I feel like this goes under no prop-sharing, but still I wanna be safe).
* We're keeping it under 25 people, DM me if you're going to show up so I can make sure that we **do not** have too many RSVPs.
* **we are going to be following all of the state mandates and health guidelines.**

MIT‚Äôs Fly in program
Hey everyone! I got into MIT‚Äôs fly in program, WISE. I don‚Äôt know if anyone‚Äôs asked this before but I was wondering what percentage of MIT WISE participants got into MIT. I know that the program is virtual this year although I think that MIT kept it just as selective. I know that getting in to a fly in programs doesn‚Äôt mean that you‚Äôll get accepted, but it‚Äôs sometimes a good indicator.

Attending only 5.111 recs?
Your average lazy senior here. How feasible would it be to attend only the 5.111 recitations and still get an A grade? (NOTE: P/NR for GIR doesn't hold for 2021's, i.e. me)

I took AP Chem and did well a long time ago...

Thoughts on 21M.361 or 21M.080?
Thinking about taking one of them, but not sure which one. I don't have any previous music tech experience (or music experience tbh).

Thinking of adding 18.675 or 18.785, anyone have the grading breakdown
Before deciding whether to add one of these courses, I would like to know what the grading breakdown looks like (eg. predominantly psets or majority tests). 

I was wondering if anyone taking said courses could provide this info.

Anyone know about the difficulty of 6.003/6.004/6.042/18.03 ?

How do you get zoom numbers for classes you want to shop this week?

--------------------------------------------------
Which EECS class??
I am a 6-2 and I really want a good foundation in EECS. It seems like the classes to take are 6.002, 6.003, and 6.004.

These are a lot so what do you guys reccomend if you cant take all of them?

Can one class' content can be learned along the way? Are any of the classes fundamental enough that if you have some lab experience they are ok to skip?
--------------------------------------------------
Schedule Conflict
I realized that my CI-HW lecture and my 6.0001 lecture conflict. They both start and end at the the same time. With that being said, all 6.0001 lectures are recorded. Is there any reason I should change my schedule? I don't see any consequence of missing the live 6.0001 lecture if it's going to be recorded, but maybe I'm missing something.
--------------------------------------------------
Noteability audio source
i will be taking lectures on zoom/prerecorded videos on my computer with bluetooth headphones to not disturb others. On the iPads they gave us, it came with noteability and I really want to take advantage of the recording capabilities. Is there a way to also allow noteability on my iPad to record the sound output from my computer while listening to it. Should I ask isnt
--------------------------------------------------
Interested in Applications of Data Science in CompSci
I don't know which foundational classes are best to take. I'm pretty stuck between:
6.041, 18.600, and 6.008

What are the most useful classes ?
--------------------------------------------------
As a listener, do I automatically get access to class materials?
Or do I have to email the professor?
--------------------------------------------------
Music vs Econ Concentration
Rising junior here, just recently switched in 6-3, looking to go into industry. I have yet to take any music or econ classes, so I'll need to make a decision soon.

I'm personally leaning more towards music because I haven't really done anything outside of playing instruments, and MIT's music tech classes look sick. Also most of the classes I wanna take involve some sort of programming/software development, so I think it would help me in that regard too (not super proficient at coding, just took 6.009 last semester).

But I do see the benefits of an econ concentration too. In general, it's nice to be financially literate and educated, but this could also open up a career in trading/stocks/data science in the business world. (Also parents see music as useless and econ as the gold standard of HASS).

Is a concentration even this important to stress over? Just want people's thoughts and opinions.

Review of 6.854 (Advanced Alg)
Anyone want to comment on what they thought about 6.854 with Karger? I have the suggested prereqs, but it still looks like it will be tough. Im wondering if I should take it remotely. Any comments or recommendations would be great!

Is HKN a frat?
I heard someone mention that HKN is a frat but I thought it was just like an honor society. If it is a frat, does that mean I should avoid joining any other fraternities/sororities if I want to be considered for it?

Benefit of 8.012 for a potential Course 16?
Hello, 

I signed up for 8.012, and I am interested in doing Course 16 or 2. Would you say this class would help me out in future, major-related classes? Non of my friends (also freshman) are taking this class, so I‚Äôm wondering if I made the right choice. 

I‚Äôm also taking 18.02,14.01, 6.0001/2, and a semi-chill UROP. Should I just drop it or leave it because there will be a productive benefit  from it? 

Thank you!

Need tips for 7.015
So I'm a prefrosh with no bio and very little chem experience, and I'm taking 3.091 and 7.015 this semester (can't 7.012 because it's full by upperclassmen, as my advisor said). 3.091 is something I can beat but I am not really sure about 7.015... I started doing biology courses from khanacademy, and I'm willing to study my ass off, but I'm not sure what's the right choice. Can anyone help me with resources or tips for 7.015? Will I be good?

UPOP
So looks like UPOP applications came out and it seems pretty exciting to me, as someone who's never had an internship yet. Anyone have any comments about how useful it actually is/if it was an overall positive experience? Also, how hard is it to get accepted into UPOP? Thanks

8.01 vs 8.01L
Hiii another confused freshman post. Can anyone speak to 8.01 vs 8.01L and which they recommend and why? Maybe in terms of workload or difficulty. I have no physics experience really and im hearing mixed advice.

Can I change my subject selections post pre-registration before registration
I thought this was possible but I can‚Äôt seem to find how.

IAP Language Classes
I'm an incoming first-year and really want to take a language class. I was going to take Korean I in the fall, but then I realized that there is also an IAP version. Could someone offer their experience with how intense the IAP version of a language is? Is it worth it to have an extra spot in my fall schedule for another GIR or a major-related class (don't have one of those yet; I'm planning course 6-9)? Or should I not stress so much about getting majors/GIRs and just take the classes that are interesting to me in the fall, and then come what may for IAP? (I suppose I'm worried that I won't be doing anything "productive" otherwise during IAP.)

Also, I read somewhere on an old post that the language classes for IAP are lottery based. Is that still true?

Thank you to anyone that could answer!

Is trying to get a stats minor worthwhile if I'm planning on doing 6-3?
I figure it doesn't have too many additional requirements and the topics seem interesting. I'm just wondering if the label of having that as a minor is beneficial for getting a job or something.

In your opinion, what is the hardest major in Course 6?

Joining ADT??
I‚Äôm interested in trying out dance, but it seems super intimidating to audition/dance in front of others. Are they beginner friendly or are there other dance groups that are?

6.036 or 6.862?
I'm a rising sophomore undergrad. I don't have much experience with ML, though I've done a good bit of coding in Python in the past. It appears that 6.862 is pretty much the same as 6.036 but with a final project at the end - would that be doable with my background?

Athena for heavy matlab jobs
How can I use the Athena cluster's computing power to complete remote tasks, particularly things like running a matlab program with very large data sets, etc.? I know I can ssh into it via the dialup, but not sure how that works with matlab..!

Thanks!

MyMIT supported browsers
So i've decided to apply to MIT in the fall, and on [this page](http://www.mit.edu/admissions/faq/) it says that Chrome is not a supported browser? Seeing as I use Chrome, should I really switch to another browser when applying or does it not actually matter?

Covid test for those living off-campus
For incoming international (graduate) students living on-campus, it seems that they can get tested at the medical center when they arrived in Cambridge after getting MIT ID card. 

However, I am not sure if this applies to those living off-campus when they just arrive in Cambridge. Could they also go to the center for free testing after we get our ID card, to meet the traveling rule of MA?

Should I take 18.06 for course 6-3 if I took it in high school already?
I dual-enrolled at a local college for linear algebra and it pretty much covered a standard college curriculum, but of course MIT probably makes it much harder. I don't want to act like I can just handle anything a future CS class throws at me, but if the use of linear algebra is pretty limited then I'd just skip it. (I have ASE'd 18.01 and 18.02)

I'm considering also taking 18.600 instead since I heard that was pretty useful. Thoughts?
