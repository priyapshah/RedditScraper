Taking both BSCI 170/171 and CHEM 131/132 in Freshman Connections
So I'm a freshman admitted as L&S in the spring who wants to do freshman connections, trying to go into a Bio major. Is taking both of these courses at the same time a good idea, in terms of workload and all that?

False Positive COVID-19 Test?
Background: I've recently been infected with COVID (symptoms began February 20th, 70 days ago). Since then, I've received both shots of the vaccine (second shot of Pfizer on April 12th, 19 days ago). 

I just took a rapid antigen COVID test from CVS which came back positive today. My friends and family are telling me the chance that I've been reinfected is so extraordinarily low that its more likely I'm still testing positive from my previous exposure. Obviously, I'm not fully convinced.

I have to report a negative test by May 5th, which still leaves me time to get a PCR. For real, what should I do now? I don't want to report a false positive to UMD only to test negative later. In the same light, what if the PCR also shows positive? Am I really re-infected or is it just still showing that from my last bout of corona? 

Please, any advice or opinions are highly welcome. I'm stressed about this and I'm definitely not thinking straight. Thanks!

which did you find more difficult: CHEM135 or ENCE201?
I'm taking ENCE201 in the fall, and I heard it was a bear.

Just trying to get a gauge on what people's experiences were versus weed out classes like CHEM

Summer CMSC216 with Nelson
I have a few questions about the class because I've heard quite a few stories about 216

1. How many hours per week did you spend on it?

2. Any tips for success? (ie textbooks to read or videos to watch)

Thanks!

About to get an apartment with my friend in Adelphi. Anybody have a bad experience in that area?
After looking through this sub the basic consensus I got for people living off campus was to just make sure you lock your doors, don't walk in dark areas after 11, and don't keep nice things in your car. I know the areas off campus has its issues, and I know it's not as bad as people make it out to be, but I've never heard of Adelphi, and I just want to make sure that nobody has felt completely unsafe there. My friend says not to worry about it and that it's basically a college town. Anyone agree?

Can Snapchat Sustain a Friendship? [Anonymous Survey]
Hello /r/UMD! I am an undergraduate student at the University of Washington in Seattle and I‚Äôm running a study on how the use of the social media app Snapchat is influencing feelings of connection within friendships during the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, I‚Äôm looking to recruit college students from around the country who use Snapchat to take a short, 15 minute, anonymous survey about their experiences thus far in the pandemic in regard to how connected they are feeling to their friends.

Paying for UMD
Hello everyone,

So I applied to the University of Maryland a while back for the C.S. program. Amazingly, I was accepted! But I am an out-of-state resident, and I saw that in order to attend the 2 years I need to obtain my bachelor's I would have to pay over 70k (about 35k/yr). I grew up in a family with little income, and I will be the first in my family to graduate. My financial aid package was only 6k, which is not nearly enough. I am most likely going to have to decline their admission offer due to this unfortunate situation (a shame), but I wanted to ask you all how you can afford to attend UMD?

Thanks

Freshman Connection Class Registration
Hello! When you submit an application for Freshman Connection (FC), the form makes you input a course schedule of FC classes. 

What is the purpose of doing this? If the classes you picked are full, will you not be accepted to FC?

Is this considered your official course registration? 

Do you still have to meet with an academic advisor at orientation and officially register?

Will there be an opportunity to change these classes? 

Also, when do you hear if you got into FC?

Thank you!!

Advice for an incoming Freshman on making friends?
Hello everyone, I‚Äôm going to be a freshman here starting late August and I‚Äôve got a concern. Sorry if this sounds kind of pathetic, but how do you(or did you) make friends here? I hear that in college you‚Äôve only got a month or so to make friends and after that there will already be a bunch of friend groups and it‚Äôs going to get 100x harder. Is this true for UMD? I went to a new high school and it took me until May of Freshman year to make any friends, so I‚Äôm kind of freaking outüò≠. I‚Äôm really not an out going person but I‚Äôm ready to be if that‚Äôs what it takes. Also, is there anywhere to connect with other incoming freshmen online? I feel like it would be nice to know some names before the fall. Anyways, I‚Äôm just looking for some advice, any and all answers are appreciated. Thank you all and have a good day.

Transfer Student Orientation
Hello! 

I‚Äôm an incoming transfer student to College Park and I had a question regarding online student orientation. 

I am transferring from a community college and have checked my submitted transcript for UMD that says 69 of my credits transferred and are applicable to my major (early childhood education) 

I got an email from the College of Education with a list of steps I need to complete before my orientation on May 7. This orientation is where I will be registering for classes. 

All four of my math classes transferred to umd (stat 100, math212, 213, and 214) Do I still have to take the math placement test if these classes have all transferred over? The message seemed generic to both freshman and transfer students, so I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd need to take it since my classes have transferred over for math. I‚Äôll ask the College of Education on Monday too, just curious if anyone here knows :) 

Thank you!

I just want to say...
It's nice seeing people walking outside without masks enjoying nature, it's nice seeing people out studying together, it's nice being able to have a friend over at your room, it's nice seeing people serving food and soft serve to themselves again, and it's nice finally seeing other people eating at the diner with multiple friends together. 

If this is what campus is beginning to look like now, it *will* be normal next semester. Don't let biased and unsupported reddit comments convince you otherwise.

Thank you!

does math461 curve?
I'm taking math461 with Allan Yashinski and I'm not doing so great in this class. He's a really good lecturer, I've just been really struggling with my mental health/relapsing and other circumstances. I do watch all the lectures and take notes, but I freak out during exams because I spend too much time rereading the same question, lose track of time, etc. After taking today's exam I feel like it will be impossible for me to pass the class, unless I'm lucky and get 100% on the final, even then, I would likely only get around a 67%. In the syllabus he said that he'd curve only if the average exam scores are much lower than he expected, and so far all 3 graded midterms have had an average of around 83% which isn't low. I was wondering if anyone who has taken this class with him before knows what the usual cutoff is. I really don't want to have to drop this class because then I would be below 12 credits, and I'm worried that being a part-time student will affect my financial aid from mdcaps. Plus I already dropped 216 this semester and don't want to fall even further behind. Thanks!

Computer Science classes
Yo so I‚Äôm a freshman going to umd through the freshman connections program and to enroll in the freshman connections program I have to fill out a schedule for myself. I found a 4 year plan on the umd website for computer science and basically it said that I should take math140 (calculus) my first year but I haven‚Äôt even taken precalc yet. And if I want to take precalc my first year then I can‚Äôt take CMSC131 and it would mess up my 4 year plan. What should I do? Should I take precalc this summer and then hopefully that would prepare me enough to take calc when school starts?
--------------------------------------------------
Math Placement Test
edit: basically just want to know how similar the practice test is to the actual one!

I'm an incoming freshman and I've got to take the math placement test. For the computer science gateway requirements, I need to place into math 140. I'm currently taking BC calc.

How difficult is the placement test? I did the practice test and scores 100% and I'm wondering how similar the practice test is to the actual one? If I got 100% on the practice, would I score really well on the actual one? Also, does it tell you your score and class placement when you finish or do you find out at orientation?

Thanks!

Kitchen??
Hello!!

I'm going to be a freshman at UMD next year in Centreville. I'm also the biggest foodie that I know. However, I know that individual dorm rooms don't have their own kitchens, and I don't know much about the hall kitchens. Does anyone know where I could find a kitchen (in a dorm or somewhere else, the more complete the better) to cook/bake food as a freshman? What are the kitchens like?

Thanks!! I've attached some pictures below, showing the potential I have if I do manage to find access to a kitchen. Have some food:

cmsc411 vs cmsc424
I have heard both aren't good classes, but any opinions on which one is more time consuming? For fall Yoon is teaching cmsc411 and amol desphande is teaching cmsc424.

Is there a difference between the amount of time I will need to use for work in each class?

Questions about the CS department at UMD
Hi guys. I was admitted to UMD College Park's class of 2025 for Computer Science and had some questions about the school. For context, I‚Äôm an international student and grad school after college (maybe directly or maybe after 1-3 years of OPT) is extremely important for me. UMD is one of my top 2 choices right now, the other being UBC.

* Is it easy for undergraduates to participate in research? Do the CS professors care about YOUR academic experience? Is it easy to approach them/ get involved in their research? Is the collective CS faculty with all the TAs and Professors, overall good and do they care about the undergraduate students?
* I‚Äôve heard a lot about the Brendon Iribe Centre for its labs, research facilities, and maker spaces. Is it accessible by the undergrads or is it mostly just reserved for post grad students/researchers/other important people?
* How often do students get paid internships/co-ops or even unpaid internships?
* What would you estimate to be an average salary for CS graduates right after graduation? \[I know that there is an enormous no. of CS majors and it‚Äôs difficult to know but your estimates matter to me\]
* Which companies recruit the most UMD CS graduates?

It would be great if y'all could help. Thank you.

I suck at school and I'm tired of myself
Title. I keep promising myself that I'm gonna do better next semester and I end up with the same destructive habits. Could you please point me to some recourses for learning how to study effectively? I've already started to quit some of my bad habits. Haven't üå≥  for almost three weeks now. Been waking up earlier. Haven't gone out too much except for getting fresh air. I really wanna turn things around. I see people talking about their Bs and As and I'm like F! Why do I have to always worry about my Cs turning into Ds. I don't wanna hate myself for school. I wanna hate myself for more serious stuff in life tbh. I have the whole summer to work on myself. I'm not even praying for my ass to be saved this time. I'm pretty sure the gods are tired of me too.

Information Science Students Help URGENTLY Needed (Thank you!)
So I‚Äôll start off by saying I was a cs student at first and I took cmsc131 successfully. I later switched into info sci and my advisor never mentioned anything about INST126 so I am now deep in my Infosci degree 2 semester away from INST490, and I don‚Äôt have INST126 done. The thing is it says must not have taken INST326 (Python) in order to take INST126 and I took CMSC131 which is an equivalent to 326. Does this mean I can‚Äôt take 126 or don‚Äôt need it? In my audit it still says I need it but it also says must be completed within first 60 credit hours of declaring major which makes me very worried as I‚Äôm well past this point. Any helpful advice or experiences would be appreciated

MTAP or other university applications?
Hello! Im planning on going into cc for atleast freshman year then transfer. I was originally planning on doing mtap to get a guaranteed safety and apply to Johns Hopkins and Georgetown as my top choices but it looks like If I do mtap and I get into those two schools I will still have to go to UMD cause its binding. I cant stay at cc for two years just because of how many college credits I already have. Should I go with the guaranteed option of UMD or go risky and just apply to JHU and georgetown without mtap and see what happens? (My cc has an articulation agreement with JHU and im doing an intership at JHU over the summer to get a rec letter for reference)

Is a summer course and a full time job doable?
I will be working full time this summer but I was considering doing a summer class to free up some space later on. It would be an I-series gened so I imagine the content itself wouldn't be bad but not sure if the workload would work well with a full time job. I haven't taken one of these types of courses yet so I'm really not sure. What do you all think and also, any recommendations for easy minimal effort courses that would work for me if I go through with this? (They also would need to be asynchronous of course).

Chances of getting into Smith School? (Transfer)
So I was accepted to UMD as a transfer student but in the Letters of Science. Due to me taking my final gateway course now, UMD won‚Äôt let me know if I‚Äôm accepted until mid-July (cause they want my final transcript). I want to know my chances of getting into the Smith School (Information Systems was the major I applied to)

GPA: 3.717

Gateway courses:
Accounting 1: B
Business Calc - Pass Option 
Business Stats- Currently taking

I‚Äôm hoping to get an A in Stats. Do you think a B in Stats would let me in?

What's the difficulty and workload like for CMSC423 with Patro?
I'm currently signed up for CMSC414 and waitlisted for CMSC420 right now, but I'm afraid these two classes may be kind of code heavy. I'm considering switching out of 420 and into CMSC423. How heavy and how difficult is the workload for 423? I also did not do well in 351 and I heard the class is mostly algorithms.

Incoming Freshman Rescission
I know this is a trope at this point, but I'm freaking out so I couldn't help myself. 

I was admitted into Letters and Sciences and I might end senior year with a D+ in AP AB Calc and 2 C+s in AP Physics and AP Stats. I'm going to do the best I can to bring those grades up, but in case I can't, does anyone know if I'll get fully rescinded? Would academic probation be an option? Any advice on next best steps would be greatly appreciated, I really want to attend UMD next year.

how is UMD physics

It would be Saturday, maybe some other day instead. I can negotiate. If anyone here is into easy money, PM me. We can talk details.

How hard is Data Science at UMD?
I applied for the data science major at UMD, and I see a lot of people talking about how difficult CS is at UMD. I know that data science is a part of the CS department, but is data science also extremely difficult at UMD or is it manageable?

Incoming Freshmen Fall 2021
I was wondering whether I could get a single dorm room as a freshmen? I chose single gender housing with preference to Cecil Hall. I cannot function well with a roommate and really need my personal space.. is it possible to get a single room? I'm willing to pay a higher price even, I just don't think I'll be doing great with a roommate living in with me.
--------------------------------------------------
Does anyone know why course evals are due BEFORE finals?
I have one of those rare circumstances where the professor for a class is really bad, and I need to write a relatively harsh course review.  I know the responses are anonymized, but that process is not perfect, since everyone writes slightly differently.  If I could submit the eval after grades were in, or I knew the professor wouldn't see the eval until after grades are in, it'd be a lot easier to be honest about the shortcomings of a class.

question about double majoring
How realistic would it for me to double major in **civil engineering** and **mechanical engineering?** I understand that both are pretty specialized (esp. junior and senior year), so undoubtedly it would be a challenge.

Sub-question: In electives, can I an ENCE elective that covers an elective for both ENCE and ENME, or vice versa?

Also, though it is not listed, could I do something like a civil engineering major and a mechanical engineering minor?
--------------------------------------------------
PSYC Major Question
I am about to officially become a psychology major and plan on going into the psychology field. I was wondering what I should do with my extra credits and have come down to two options:

1. Do a B.S. in PSYC with a minor in human development. This will also allow me to take some elective credits 
2. Do a B.A. in PSYC and a B.S. in human development

Which do you think is better? Is anyone in the human development major?

Thanks in advance!

hi all!

I so far have put down CMSC 131, UNIV100, ENGL101, GEOG140, and MATH141down for a total of 15 credits, however, I can have 17 total. I already have AP credit for AP US History and AP Macroeconomics, so which other courses should I take my freshman year which would be helpful in the long run?

79% of Campus Received Vaccine
Some good news for your timeline!

The campus COVID-19 dashboard ([https://umd.edu/covid-19-dashboard](https://umd.edu/covid-19-dashboard)) has been updated to include vaccination data. 47% of the campus community is now fully vaccinated, and another 32% is partially vaccinated. 

This means that, barring some change in second dose administration, campus should reach the herd immunity threshold of around 70% fully vaccinated within the next six weeks. Way to go, Terps!

Trying to switch to the CS LEP
Incoming Terp here! üëã

I'm going in as a Letters and Sciences student and trying to figure out how the process works to pursue my intended major, CS.

I read [online](https://lep.umd.edu/computerscience.html) that all I need to do is complete some gateway requirements.

>1. Completion of CMSC 131 \[Object-Oriented Programming I\]  
>  
>2. Completion of CMSC 132 \[Object-Oriented Programming II\]  
>  
>3. Completion of MATH 140 \[Calculus I\]

Of these gateway requirements, I believe APCSA and AP Calc satisfies requirements 1 and 3 respectively.

Is this correct or am I missing something?

Also, How would I go about testing out of CMSC 132? And if I am successful, would I be able to email the admissions office with my Change Of Major request before Fall semester starts?

Thanks for your help!

Letters & Sciences instead of Finance! HELP PLEASE. I need your advice to decide.
So im an international student majoring in Business, Finance in my current uni. I finished almost 54 credits including this semester. I never wanted to transfer but I had to due to reasons that dont need to be mentioned... MY ISSUE IS: i got accepted into this weird major ‚Äúletters & sciences‚Äù and after a long research i knew this isnt a major and that i got rejected by my preferred finance major. 

I was really excited when i saw ‚Äúcongratulations! i‚Äôm pleased to offer you the admission...‚Äù until i saw the major Letters and Sciences. Disappointing. The thing is, when i checked the required courses for business majors, i almost finished them all in my current university except for accounting and math! With a very high GPA: 3.7. 

It is really not fair that I‚Äôm getting into letters and sciences for these two courses that i can easily finish once im admitted, i dont get the process and im not sure if i will be guaranteed a spot if i accepted this. 

I am willing to commit if i had a guarantee, but at the same time im scared that it‚Äôll be another disappointment and another waste of time. I have only 2 years until my expected graduation, and im really not feeling spending an extra year as a ‚Äúno major‚Äù just to get into a major that im already studying.

i apologize for the emotional novel lol. please share your experiences, or any advice you might have for me at this point. Should i accept? Should i call the admissions and try to explain my issue (are they even flexible)? I waited a year for them and letters and science feels like an insult to the past 2 years ive been studying finance. 

Thank youü•∫

Is a 3.152 with an upward trend at UMD good enough for UMDSchoolofMedicine?
Upward trend =2.7 as freshman, then 2.9 as sophomore, then 3.1 (current junior, will take P and withdraw one class), UMD is the best school for me given location, finance and reputation, and I heard they might favor applicants who went to UMD for undergrad, any input?

To anyone who witnessed the crowd and extremists outside Mckeldin Library....
I am so sorry that you had to witness it. I was there and I was not happy at all or entertaining the nonsense. I am a Christian and the display that they did is not a reflection on what true Christianity is and how we should act. They‚Äôre just fakes. 

They were saying a lot of wild things which I will not repeat on here cause it was just super upsetting to witness. They had it all wrong. I don‚Äôt want anyone to think that this is how all Christians act. 

To refute everything that they said, I just want to say that Jesus loves each and every one of you. And it doesn‚Äôt matter what experiences you had or whatever you are currently doing or what you have done in the past. Jesus will not hate you because you are a woman, not a virgin, because of your orientation or anything. Jesus died for every one. And he just wants you to understand that and accept him. But it is also not by force. You have the final decision on if you want to follow him or not. But because we want you all to receive salvation, we tell people about Jesus. Yes the Bible can seem scary and make Christians seem like terrible people and that God just hates everyone, but he doesn‚Äôt. He honestly doesn‚Äôt. 

That‚Äôs all I want to say. Don‚Äôt believe or follow anything those idiots were saying. God loves you no matter what.






If this gets downvoted or deleted, then it‚Äôs okay. But all I want to let anyone who witnessed the idiotic display to know that God won‚Äôt condone that. And if you need a space to vent, you can DM me.

Are Honors Seminars restricted to University Honors only or can any Honors college student take them?
Probably an easy question to answer, but I was kind of confused. I am a rising Freshman and was planning out my Gen eds. They seem more interesting/fun than a regular class, so I was wondering if I could take HONR classes as a member in another Honors college (I am not in University Honors). Looking at this website [https://academiccatalog.umd.edu/undergraduate/approved-courses/honr/](https://academiccatalog.umd.edu/undergraduate/approved-courses/honr/), it says that I need permission from UH, which implies that it is only for UH. This says the same: [https://dbknews.com/2019/03/14/umd-honors-college-programs-curriculum-change-university-honors-courses-senate/](https://dbknews.com/2019/03/14/umd-honors-college-programs-curriculum-change-university-honors-courses-senate/).

Students, please do not cheat...
Hello everyone, 

With the end of this very unusual semester approaching, I know a lot of you are exhausted and overwhelmed. Remote learning has not been easy for everyone, some of you are in less-than-ideal households, don't have access to computers/laptops, and/or dealing with health (mental and physical) issues.  

I know some of my students have been struggling, and unfortunately, a few of them made the decision to plagiarize on their papers. This is a very bad decision, the repercussions of which will follow you throughout your time at UMD, and potentially after. We are aware of the online sources to help you cheat/avoid plagiarism checkers, but trust me, the instructors have access to just as many, and better developed, tools to detect academic dishonestly. If your work is determined to be unoriginal, you'll get an automatic XF (failure due to academic dishonesty) in your transcript if you're an undergrad, and you'll be expelled from the university if you're a grad student. This means forget graduate school, government jobs etc. It also ruins the experience for us too. Catching students who lie, cheat, and plagiarize, makes us more guarded and less trusting in the future.

It's just not worth it. Email your instructors/TAs, explain your situation and ask for help. Most of us love you and we understand how difficult this academic year has been. Yes, there are some instructors who simply don't care, but they don't represent the majority. We want you to be successful in and out of the classroom. If your instructor is not sympathetic, reach out to several resources we have at the university to make your case. If you're at the end of your rope, do the best you can and pass with a B or a C instead of trying to cheat your way to an A. The risk of getting caught and ruining your academic career, and potentially your professional career, isn't worth it.

Gender Housing Options
Okay so I will be a Freshman in the fall (woo 25‚Äô) and I am female. I am filling out the housing form and I‚Äôm conflicted on whether I should put a preference for Mixed gender floor/wing or single gender floor/wing. 

Current thoughts: 
So far I‚Äôve seen mixed gender floors are great for making lots of friends which is super important to me but if the overall experience in my dorm sucks other than that‚Ä¶I can find friends other ways. (bad ex. louder or messier overall) 

Single gender floor/wing seems the safest option but I‚Äôm also concerned about how many people I‚Äôll have to constantly be fighting with to use the bathroom/showers‚Ä¶ 

Anyways does anyone have any thoughts or general pros and cons? Thanks!

math placement exam
so i have somehow figured out that i might need to take the math placement exam. the issue is that i absolutely suck at math and am lowkey panicking about it. i took the courses i needed for math back at my other school but i need a calc class apparently even though my major doesn‚Äôt even involve math and i have the gateway credit. is there a chance that i could be exempt from it if i take the calc class at another school and transfer it over by the time the situation becomes an issue? i took a stats class which apparently is only a gateway class and then i would still need the calc class. any advice is appreciated as i need some good news today lol.

Deciding whether UMD will be a right fit for me
 Hi everyone. I was admitted to UMD‚Äôs class of 2025 and am currently deciding between UBC‚Äôs Vancouver Campus and UMD College Park for Computer Science. I know that this also comes to a Canada vs USA situation but barring that I would like to get to know which would be better for me in terms of my education. For context, I‚Äôm an international student and an important factor for me is employability, though I'm not sure whether I will directly go to grad school or work for 2-3 years first. I‚Äôve heard that UMD has excellent opportunities in terms of its CS program with specializations/focuses in fields like AI and data science and rigorous coursework, along with excellent research, co-op, internship and employment opportunities. There's a huge community of Computer Science students with several CS clubs. I‚Äôve also heard about the fabulous Brendon Iribe Centre with its labs and maker spaces, the Writing Centre and the Career Centre. However, I would like to know more about how the individual student does at UMD since it will obviously not be easy to stand out among 4000 CS majors. What are the class sizes like? The Professors are definitely qualified but are they nice and approachable? Do they care about every student? Also what is the student life like? I‚Äôve heard that dorm rooms are really crappy. What about the food options? If you have any opinion about why UBC or UMD would be better than the other please do share it with me. It would be great if you all could help. Thanks a lot!!

Story for The Diamondback on Grieving During This Time of Newfound Hope
Hi all,

Lately, as more people have been getting vaccinated, I've felt more hopeful than I have in over a year. I've also been thinking a lot about those who have lost loved ones during the pandemic ‚Äî how it must feel to be grieving at a time of this newfound hope. 

I'd like to write a story for The Diamondback about what it's like for UMD community members who are experiencing these two emotions at once. If you have a story you'd like to share, my DMs are open. You can also email [newsumdbk@gmail.com](mailto:newsumdbk@gmail.com). 

Thanks all and be well.

P/F questoin about CompE
If I were to p/f  cmsc132 and/or phy161 as a freshman CompE major, would it be a bad look when applying for a master's program later on in life?

Advisors are saying that the transcript would have a note saying p/f offered due to covid but would they ever look at that?

I had no prior coding experience coming into this class, does anyone have tips or useful studying resources?

CS Upper level concentration
I'm at the stage in CS where I need to be looking at an Upper-level concentration to finish the major. A lot of my peers are doing STAT as a minor or double major, but I absolutely despise the subject... Are there any other majors/minors that are interesting and still even somewhat relevant to the major? I was looking at GIS and I've taken some courses, and it's pretty interesting so far, but not sure how worth a minor/double major is for the subject. Any experiences/thoughts would be appreciated!

Spring Semester BMGT schedule help
I‚Äôm currently a freshman majoring in biology but I‚Äôm thinking of applying to the business school to get a degree in information systems. The gateway courses required to apply to the business school are MATH120 (or higher), BMGT 220, and BMGT 230 or something equivalent. I told my advisor I planned on taking all 3 next semester plus some electives or gen eds and they told me it was a bad idea since those classes are quite rigorous. 

Does anyone have any advice or personal experience taking all 3 or just any of the classes, and would you mind telling me if you think it would be a manageable or anything like that. It would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

I‚Äôm a Fall 2021 Transfer Applicant and I could use some help
Hey everyone, just wondering if I could get some help from those who are familiar with the transfer admissions process. 

I applied on the early action deadline of March 1st and checked my portal this past weekend since results are coming out this week. I saw that my transcript wasn‚Äôt received and I contacted admissions where they confirmed they hadn‚Äôt received it yet. I ordered another transcript for safe measure but does anyone know when they receive my transcript if I‚Äôll still be considered for early action? This is big because I‚Äôm leaning heavily on financial aid and scholarship consideration. 

Kinda freaking out here lol. If anyone could help pls lmk.

Effect of taking p/f on geneds for grad school?
Title, I've done the math and the most I can get in ENGL101 is an 88% if I get 100% on every coming assignment.  Realistically I'll end up with C+/B-, and this would tank my GPA, so I'm considering taking pass/fail.  Does anyone know how grad schools (for Math/CS) would look at this, and is it better to take a letter grade?

Last time I hadn't even left my apartment and they sent me the message. Is it based on eduroam maybe?

Is UMD worth it as an international student?
I  recently got in for Physics and was wondering if it is worth it. I don't really have any other option so it is either UMD or a gap year. While I know that UMD is great for Physics, and I would probably enjoy it here but is it worth the 55k. I might have to take out loans so there is that too but my parents are going to help me with that.

Another thing to consider is that I will most likely go to grad school.  So considering all this, what do you guys think I should do? any advice would be appreciated.

How bad is a Leave of Absence?
I've spent a good chunk of the semester in and out of in-patient treatment for a mental health crisis and having my medication re-adjusted. I was fired at the end of January literally right before school started so I lost my insurance and medication access, which caused a spiral. I was just cleared to come home today and honestly haven't even started unraveling this mess. I pretty much have no choice but to take a leave of absence for this semester, which my doctors have recommended I do until fall anyway.

How screwed am I going to be?

Graduate housing
Hi all, I'll be moving down from Boston with my girlfriend this fall to start as a grad student. We've been used to living in houses with other housemates. We're hoping to find the same situation by UMD, hopefully also with decent public transport access since my girlfriend will be working in the city. Is off-campus housing plentiful? What should we expect to pay for a couple of decent rooms in the area?

Any student photographers I can hire?

And yes, of course I'm willing to pay at whatever rate you normally charge/think you deserve. Not trying to pay you in 'exposure' lol

Housing
So I am planning to transfer but UMD is not close by. I can commute by metro but I dont want to do that. So my only option is to either be in dorms or off campus. But I dont know where to look for off campus housing taking into account dorms are mostly offered to freshman and sophomores. As a Pakistani female, I prefer to have a Pakistani female roommates or muslim roommates, but majority of the facebook groups I have checked, I have gotten no luck so far. What website does everyone use to find roommates off campus with affordable rent?

girls that have lived in Cambridge Hall for STS - did you choose mixed gender floor/wing" or "single gender floor/wing" when filling out the housing application?
also why?

i'm an incoming freshman filling out my housing app. i've heard that bc of the gender ratio in STS, generally the ground floor has a few all-women rooms, 2nd and 4th floors are mixed, and 3rd floor is all-men. i'm not sure what to choose. any advice or past experiences would be helpful!

i personally wanna go mixed cuz it seems easier to make friends, but i'm not sure if all the women will choose single-gender and then there's barely any women on my floor. also my parents are cool with mixed but my grandparents (indian) will flip out when they visit me lol but thats ok

How to request a specific hall
Hi everybody, I'm an incoming freshman and I know that there is random housing beyond the registration form questions (I already did that) for freshmen, but I heard that there's a way to email the housing committee and request a specific dorm, although chances of getting it are slim. I already requested to be near the hillel, but there are certain dorms that are incredibly close that I would like to be in specifically because I plan on walking back and forth many, many times per day (prince frederick is closest but if i can only request one and not two or three I don't think I'll request that because the chance of getting it would be almost zero). If I actually can send an email, what address do I send it too and what should I say regarding a specific hall request? Thanks

Does anyone know whats happening in ENES 210?
Gotta be honest, with all the bs going on in my life this year as well as the pandemic this class is so low on my priority list but now its close to finals and I'm just confused. Can anyone who is aware of whats happening in this class or took it last semester help me with this?

Were we supposed to be in groups for this class? I literally had no interaction with anyone in this class but theres all these mentions of groups in the videos. I've been doing all the writing assignments by myself.

Is the term project really 4000 words??? This is whats getting me. It feels like that word count is suitable for multiple people working on it but then again I'm not used to writing papers that long so maybe I'm just exaggerating. 

I'm just kinda worried cause I don't even know if my startup idea is even any good no less good enough to write 4000 words on it and I gotta work on my other final projects as well. Worst case is that we were supposed to be in groups but I just missed it and now I have to do everything by myself.

Upper level courses for CS software development concentration?
I‚Äôm going to be a junior in the fall and will be starting my upper-level computer science courses soon. (transfer). I was wondering what a good route is for someone who primarily wants to focus on software development and secondarily on computer graphics. I‚Äôll be taking the required 5 400 level courses, and 2 more 400 level courses for my CS electives. That leaves me with 7 400 level courses to perfect software development and some computer graphics. Just want to make sure the courses I select are best for my future career.

Any EMTS on here? What's it like being a full time student and volunteering?
Hi! 

I was wondering if I anybody could tell me about their experience being an EMT here while being a full time student? In high school, I made it through the requirements to be a cadet EMT in Moco, but my parents were worried about my coursework in junior and senior year and retracted their permission to let me be one because I was a minor then. 

I would really like to see if I could pick this up again now that I am in college, and I was just really curious about the process and the commitment.

I was accepted into the Smith School of Business but I'm realizing more that I would much rather pursue a degree in CS (co-founder of coding club, taken AP CS, have done a couple side projects). I requested a change via email already however they were unable to directly admit me to it as it's an LEP. However, they mentioned that CS has a non-competitive review for internal transfer students. Does this mean that as long as I pass the necessary gateway classes I will be guaranteed in? I know the gateway classes are CMSC 131+132, as well as MATH 140. Will I be able to take some of these my first semester? Since I am not in CS as of now, am I required to take some business-related courses and am I not permitted to taking any CS courses? How long would it take me to actually successfully change my major? Sorry if any of these are dumb questions/have been answered already, I'm just a bit confused.

MATH240 vs STAT400 for 3rd semester CS?
Next semester I plan on taking CMSC216 and CMSC250 and want to take either MATH240 or STAT400. I might get a bad professor in MATH240 and would have a higher chance of getting a good professor in STAT400. I would plan on taking MATH240 in the spring if I didn't take it in the fall. Is this a feasible idea or not?

Lost the social connection in UMD
Hi I'm a "commuter" transfer student (from Montgomery College) and this pandemic has made it extremely hard to keep up with the social life "on campus". Like at least 75-80% of my friends were on campus this year and I feel like they were able to keep their connection and have interactions/inside jokes, and have special bondings. I mean I'm not against it, but I just feel left out and I feel like I don't really have friends at campus anymore. Like I live with emotionally abusive parents and they take away my belongings and car keys even when I'm 22, and give me millions of excuses to not go out. Like I get there's a pandemic but I'm vaccinated and I know how to social distance. Like it's been almost 6 months since I seen a college friend in general, and I feel so left out. 

It has been feeling like schoolwork, work, and then sleep. Classes are a pain in the ass and they take up most of my free time. I barely have time for any social interaction on campus. The only thing that is keeping me sane is a discord server. But at this point, like the college experience REALLY let me down. Like I don't know what it's like to go to Marathon at night with friends, study at Mckeldin really late, roam around campus at night, drink with friends because pre-covid I was stuck driving back and forth from home. Anyways a big letdown of a UMD, especially from a commuter student and I hope I get out of this situation fast because I can barely take it anymore. I'm sorry for ranting but UMD was really a letdown for me personally.

U of Maryland 2021 undergrad admissions? (RD)
Hi, I applied to U Maryland this January, but haven't heard anything from the university yet, neither an offer nor a rejection letter. According to its website, the deadline for RD release was April 1, so I wrote two emails to the admissions office inquiring about my application status, but have not heard back either. Is anyone facing the same situation or has any idea what is going on? Thanks!

Math240 summer professors?
Has anybody heard about Stavros Papathanasiou or Dmitrii Gudin? Only 2 professors teaching lin al in the summer, so I‚Äôd appreciate if anyone who has taken a class with them gives some feedback
--------------------------------------------------
Burnout
At this point of the semester, it's a week of burnout doing two days work in seven, followed by an approaching deadline that gives you two days two cram all what you've missed, work that you promised yourself would you would give ten days for, which in turn burns you out for another week.

And yeah, breaks don't do shit. I took a break yesterday. Couldn't sleep because of the anxiety, so I woke up super late today and most of the day is wasted. I feel like I need a guilt-free two day break but that's impossible this late in the semester. 

And even if by some stroke of luck I'm up to date with my coursework, the overwhelming guilt of not having started my research well into my second semester of grad school while others have been doing fantastic work gives me the same deal. I'm not teaching, I'm not doing research, I'm just taking courses. How am I gonna survive the next semester with courses AND a TA/RA post?

The curse of being an exceptional child is you can never deal with actual challenges in a healthy manner when you grow up. You deal with them alright. You're still pretty smart. But it takes a toll on your physical and mental wellbeing.

June can't come soon enough. I can't wait for new and creative forms of stress and guilt this summer.

If you were wondering about the best food in college park, Marathon deli is obviously the best one, Nobody can change my mind. I should be sponsored for this free promo lol.

What is the fastest way I can get to UMD
I got rejected as a freshman (maybe because I did RD) and now I think the only option I have is to transfer. I need to know what the fastest way is to get admitted. I know this sounds dumb but UMD really is my dream school and I don't want to miss out on the opportunities there, so I need to go there ASAP. Please correct me if I am wrong, but I think my options are:  


1. Go to CC for 1/5 years (45 credits for lep) and transfer, but this costs so much time. I want to get in after a year if possible.
2. Similar to option 1 but MTAP and it takes 2 years.
3. Wait a year and reapply EA (can't do but I just want to know if possible)
4. Take freshman connection? Not completely sure what that is, but I think if there was an option where I take core courses without being considered a transfer students, sort of reapplying, it would be for me (kind of sounds like college though)

What are you guys thoughts on my situation. Any tiny bit of information helps.

In much need of some advice! Fall 2021 transfer Student Question!!
Hello everyone I just accepted into the University of Maryland @ Shady Grove  Campus for information sciences, on my application I applied to the University of Maryland @ College Park campus for Computer Sciences To this day I haven't heard back about my admissions to College park for Computer Sciences, I called the admissions offices they told me they would be releasing decisions for the Fall 2021 and the end of April, 

Question is 

Has even one here gotten accepted to both campuses before?

Is anyone here in the computer sciences Fall 2021 transferring to UMD college park gotten their decision letter?

UNIV100
I‚Äôm an incoming freshman through the freshman connection program, so I have to take UNIV100 for the fall semester. I requested one 4 credit class and 3 3 credit classes, which including UNIV100 brings me to 5 classes and 14 credits. I feel like this is a little bit light, so I was considering emailing FC and asking them to add one more class in my primary requested column, probably another 3 credit.

I was wondering what UNIV100 actually entails, if it is an ‚Äúactual‚Äù class with traditional curriculum and workload, I‚Äôd be taking 6 classes and I feel like that‚Äôs a lot. Is UNIV100 more of a traditional class, or do I have room to bring myself up to 17 credits?

Just committed to the class of 25 and want advice on my schedule for an undecided major
I am super undecided at the moment but figured I would try computer science first semester since I have a pretty big background in computers as a whole and I know it is pretty good at UMD. Not sure what else I want to do but here is my early thoughts on a prospective schedule 

MATH240 

-Got a 4 on the BC exam so I get out of 140/141. I‚Äôm taking linear this year so I figured I would take it while I still somewhat remembered it. 

CMSC131

-Took ap computer science and really slacked the whole year and didn‚Äôt do very well. My teacher thought I had a lot of potential but was just too lazy. Prior to the class I was more interested in computer science but I still want to give it a shot. 

INAG110

-This one I‚Äôm a bit less sure about, but I heard someone suggest it and it seems like a useful class. 

BSCI170

-Never had room to take ap bio since I took ap physics and ap chem. Not sure if I will love bio but figured it is worth a shot. 

This leaves me at 15 credits but I‚Äôd like some advice on class difficulty and how if you guys would recommend them. Also if anyone else was in a similar undecided position, advice on that would also be super appreciated.

What's on your student to-do list?
This week I have a third mid-term tomorrow, then a discussion afterward, an essay due on Monday, and I'm caught up in this lab that was supposed to take 2 hours but wound up taking 12 hours. Not due to procrastination or anything, but because the spreadsheet's all wrong and you can't copy and paste without duffing the equation and no way to bring it back lol. Then I have more practice assignments and a mid-term next Tuesday, and another discussion.  Then I have an essay due on the 25th and another final mid-term. And then I have another lab, and a report. It goes on like this every week for me :)

After kicking out all this effort I have C- in all of my classes. If my %s dip any lower then all of it was for naught. I have Cs on most on my exams. Most people have 50s. My profs say that "if no one gets an A, then they'll curve". So I'm pretty much fucked. There's someone getting 120% on like every assignment. haha. I guess like, 70% of us are gonna fail! 

 this isn't a cry for help hbu? what's on your list?

Questions on when to apply to UMD as a MTAP student?
I am currently a freshman at Montgomery College in my 2nd semester. I am in the process to apply as a US Transfer under the early action spring enrollment deadline. Is this a right time to apply? Am I too early? Also should I take a UMD course in the summer or no? Last question, after I apply am I applying for Spring 2022 and since I graduate that semester from CC am I starting next spring or whenever I finish getting my degree at my community college? So would I be able to attend UMD in Fall 2022 even though I am applying under Spring 2022. Thank you! Sorry if this was confusing.

Like I'm glad that exists but could you stop sending every single person in the department an email about it twice a week? I feel like every department could send one big email once a week and the university could send only REALLY important stuff. I'm so fuckin overwhelmed dude just stop telling me about unpaid internship deadlines I don't even qualify for in individual messages.

Questions regarding MS in CS at UMD
Hi everyone!

I was recently accepted into the BS/MS program at UMD starting fall 2021. I had a few queries regarding it:

1. Is it possible to defer my acceptance? If yes, how do I do it? What is the maximum time for which you can defer?
2. Since its a 1 year BS/MS program, I need to complete 21 credits since 3 courses will double count from my BS. If I were to pursue a non-thesis option, how many courses would I need to complete? If I were to pursue a thesis option, then how many courses would I need to complete?
3. Is it easy to transition from MS to PhD at UMD?

how necessary is it to fill out a housing application prior to May 1?
hi! i'm a potential incoming transfer sophomore student who was accepted for fall 2021! the admissions decisions literally came out the other day and i am still waiting for other colleges to release their decisions but i do not want to get screwed over by not getting housing if i continue to wait.

to preface, i am non-binary and if i do enroll at UMD, gender-inclusive or mixed gender housing is a ***need*** for me. i am afraid that if i wait for my other decisions i will possibly miss out on getting a dorm in a gender-inclusive or mixed gender dorm hall. i'm aware i shouldn't be picky- as i am a transfer student, but i really am not so for the idea of living in a dorm hall without gender inclusivity.

should i just commit to UMD now and not risk potentially losing housing for next year? or does it not matter if i wait a few weeks-a month after May 1 to fill out an application for housing?

if i am unable to get gender inclusive housing i was wondering how difficult it is to get a dorm in queen anne's? or north hill area? i will be an architecture student so close-proximity to the architecture building would be a pro!

sorry if this post is all over the place, i was not really expecting to get admitted so i'm kind of lost haha

So now I am thinking about doing Business because there are more opportunities and I can justify spending the money. I am hoping to work my ass off for paid opportunities and experience.

What would you guys recommend? Due to my anhedonia (lack of motivation and pleasure) I know I most likely won‚Äôt enjoy either one, but I will still be willing to put in the work no matter what I am studying.

FinAid FAFSA problem
So, I got accepted as a transfer student and went to check what‚Äôs up with my financial aid and etc, but finaid think says that they didn‚Äôt get my FAFSA which is weird because (I checked again already) I put UMD as my main school and I submitted my FAFSA before deadline. Should I just call them and did anybody have the same problem before?

EDIT:
If anyone is interested. It just appeared, so it either the fact that I committed, or it was just their delay, go figure. But my issue is resolved
--------------------------------------------------
Opinions of best way to move around campus?
So I got admitted to transfer from a CC as a CS major next semester, and I was wondering what‚Äôs the best way to move in campus?, I have only been to UMD around three times and driving in there always was a horrible experience. 

I‚Äôve seen a lot of people have mentioned besides the buses biking, but as embarrassing as it is I never learned how to ride one. I do however know how to skate, and my mom even offered to gift me an electric board for getting in, but idkno if the rules for scooters are as enforced for them?

I‚Äôd appreciate any tips too, as this is going to be my first actual college campus experience, I feel both nervous and excited

Edit: Oh yeah If anyone wants to be transfer buddies this fall too feel free to PM me!!

Has this housing rental situation happened to yall?
A few weeks ago, I was searching for renting apartments and then received a response back from a person who could rent his apartment. I then met with him in-person (to see if the apartment was legit and he wanted an in-person meeting)  I agreed to rent a room with him. He said he would give me details of my leasing contract. It has been awhile since I heard back from him. No details on contract or even payment methods. I have sent follow up texts (his preffered method of communication), but still no response. This has not happened to me with rentals before.

Should I resume my apartment search? Felt kinda frustrated tbh. Kinda felt like my time was wasted.  


TLDR:  Got in contact with apartment owner for available rooms. Met in person. He agreed to let me a room. No response back even after follow up messages.

do you handwrite code for exams in CS classes? sincerely, a concerned HS senior that was about to commit to UMD CS
I'm a prospective CS major for class of 25 and plan on committing by the end of this week lol but I saw a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/b1wxj7/how_is_umd_cs/) from two years ago abt CS classes at UMD that said "The tests are awful. hand coding on paper is horrific, but sadly it's the only way the department feels they can prevent cheating."

Is this true? I know that things have probably changed due to the pandemic, so I'm guessing everything is digital now, but for those of you that were taking CS classes before the pandemic: Is every little test and quiz over the course of the semester taken on paper? Do you have to write out the code for each CS course's final by hand? Are the assignments handwritten too, or are they allowed to be written digitally? I'm just really surprised that after a month of learning abt UMD and its CS program, I'm only now learning about this. Given this post was 2 years ago, I'm crossing my fingers that this is outdated (for in-person learning).

Just got accepted to the engineering school(CC student with 3.45 GPA). However, I am worried because my spring grades will look like 1A, 2B, 1C. I also accepted to go to UMD through myCoallition.

Looking for a club to be in this fall? Apply for Season 17 of Survivor Maryland
Survivor Maryland is a semester long competition, similar to the CBS show Survivor, but here at Maryland. It goes for about 90 days and 16-20 students will compete in physical, mental, and strategic students and also make friends along the way. Fill out the application below and sign up for an interview! Applications are due May 9th and you‚Äôll hear back before the fall.

Speaking from personal experience, Survivor Maryland is one of my favorite things i‚Äôve done. Regardless of placement, you‚Äôll make friends pretty much no matter what. I‚Äôve played once and been on the crew the past 3 semesters and loved every minute of it. Also, if you just want to watch from the crew, you‚Äôre more than welcome to join!

If you want to go to an event first to check out what it‚Äôs like, just PM me and I can help set that up!

Transfer deferred
So I got deferred for the fall semester until I send in my final grades for the spring. I am currently taking calculus 1 (4 credits), sociology 101 (3 credits), psychology 100 (4 credits), philosophy 101 (3 credits) and Korean 101 (4 credits). Currently I am on the cusp of getting an A in calculus, but otherwise I have an A for the rest of the classes which would make my gpa for the spring a 3.78 if I had a B in calc. Do you think I should be fine with getting into UMD?

My show is Saturdays at 1pm on Digital, and this weeks theme is music inspired by crushes. I wanted to switch things up and get some real world responses from the community b/c why not.

If I like the song, i'l include it with the reasoning you give. Don't worry about being outed b/c very few people listen to my show so if you want to get something of your chest this is a great opportunity.

Also don't be mean, im sensitive.

Anyone else commuting + mostly online next semester?
Because of all that‚Äôs happened in the last year, I am really in a completely different place in terms of school than I was in March 2020. Now that I am living back in my hometown, it just doesn‚Äôt make much sense to go back to living on campus (especially because Fall 21 and Spring 22 are my last two semesters). I‚Äôll be commuting by train which seems better than driving in my opinion and I figured out how to structure my classes so that my only in-person classes which are for my major are on Tuesday and Thursday. My other 9 credits will all be online & asynchronous because I actually really like doing online school after the past year and I enjoy the flexibility. 

I guess I just wanted to put a feeler out to see if anyone else was going through a similar experience in terms of sticking with mostly online classes and commuting as opposed to being on campus like before the pandemic. I know a lot of people are super eager to get back to campus and business as usual (and I am too!) but I also just feel like my life has changed a lot in the past year or so and I am just in a different place.

Transfer advice
So I'm at community college right now and I just got accepted into UMD as a tranfer this fall, so I have some questions regaurding transfering into the smith school. What kind of prerequisites are there and how challenging are they? If you don't get into the business school first try are you just fucked if you wanted to do a business major? Around what gpa do you normally need to get in? Also I talked to my dad, who donates and has connections to the school, and he told me he could definitely help me. I have no idea how all this goes so even if my dad helps would there still be certain requirements, gpa, etc. Also how is the workload once you're in the business school?

Looking to get in contact with a current UMD CS student as a high school senior
# Looking to get in contact with a current UMD CS student as a high school senior

Hello everyone,

I'm a high school senior who has been accepted into UMD through Letters and Sciences and am looking for some insight on what the UMD CS undergraduate track is like for a Letters and Sciences admit with little to no prior experience in the subject.

1. I am aware that the program here is highly rigorous. Is there a good enough chance that I can declare as a CS major with no prior experience and are there other a lot of students who come from letters and sciences who make it to CS in the traditional 4 years?
2. What is unique about the CS track at UMD compared to any other highly ranked CS undergrad university? Are there any specific programs or classes that are beneficial to take?
3. What are the CS-based extracurriculars like?

I appreciate the help!

Going to commit this week and I have a few questions
Hi, I'm going to commit to UMD this week I'm just waiting on a few things before putting down my deposit. In the meantime, I figured I can ask some questions. If you wanna comment and answer that would be greatly appreciated.

Do I need to have a roommate picked by May 1st when I fill out the housing application?

How many dining dollars is a good amount for someone that occasionally goes out with friends?

How easy is it to walk from class to class?

How is the environment at the business school?

How are the dorms (please share the good and the bad)?

I'll probably continue to comment questions I have as I think of them. Thanks in advance, guys :)

Is anyone else in this boat? Don‚Äôt want to jump to conclusions about anything, but I‚Äôm just confused (and now a little paranoid). 

Advice appreciated! Thanks.

FAFSA not found?
Hi all I‚Äôm a transfer student that recently got accepted into UMD and I‚Äôm trying to review my finaid report and i‚Äôm getting a message saying that they never received my FAFSA. I double checked and UMD college park is listed with the correct school code and it‚Äôs been processed for awhile now with no rejections. I tried calling FAFSA and they‚Äôre not sure why UMD doesn‚Äôt have it. 

I did just get accepted today, is it possible that i‚Äôm checking too early? or should i be concerned? has anyone else had this problem? how was it resolved?

Letters & Sciences Appeal?
Hello everyone. 

I‚Äôm a transfer student and I got accepted into the letters and sciences major today when I originally applied for biology. I believe that I have completed all the gateway courses for acceptance into the major but I think it‚Äôs the required math course that threw it off. The Biology LEP requires completion of MATH130, 135, or 140. I was advised to take MAT1360 at my CC due to a high enough ACT score. Could this be the reason I wasn‚Äôt admitted or the LEP was just too competitive this year? Is it worth it to appeal and if so, how do I got about doing it? 

If anyone has appealed before, any advice is appreciated.

Skip MATH310?
Hi rly need some advice here!!

Just to set the context, I‚Äôm a rising sophomore majoring in stat and planing on taking math310 and stat400 next sem. I am taking math246 rn and expecting to have an A by the end of the sem.

My advisor suggested that since I have both As in math240 and 241 last sem I can be exempted from math310 and take math410 instead, she also suggested to replace math310 and stat400 with just stat410. 

The problem is that I have never learned proof before so I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ready for math410 right after 200-level math classes. Also, I believe I got As in my math classes purely out of luck or maybe cuz online makes it easier to get a higher grade this year.

Plzzzzz help me out!!

Isn't the ML/AI department in UMD one of the best in the world?

is computer science at UMD worth 16K more per year than CS at UMass Amherst? WWYD?
hi all!

I was accepted in the spring for l&s at UMD, but planning to pursue a CS major VS UMass were I was accepted directly into CS with a 14K scholarship. 

Cost isn't a significant issue for me, my family will be helping me financially, however, I want to make sure that the program I choose will set me up for a stable future that will let me pay off the debt.

As students at UMD, I wanted to know, what would you do in my position? I laid out the pros and cons of each school

Pros of UMass: 14K scholarship makes it cheaper than UMD, great food, decent CS program

Pros of UMD: better CS program, proximity to DC, better career fair, less competition with other schools for internships in the area

Cons of UMass: Isolated town, more competitive for internships, ranked lower in CS, far away from Boston

Cons of UMD: 16K more expensive per year, decent college town

Do you like UMD?
Hi guys,

I'm freshly 21 and just got accepted to UMD as a transfer. I'm doing exploratory studies then hopefully transferring to CS (I was a music major previously so I don't have the prerequisites). UMD is my first pick, but before I commit I want to ask: do you guys like being at UMD? Do you guys generally like living on or near campus? Is the student life good? Diversity good? Faculty good? 
For context, the other option I'm weighing is CU Boulder which has the pros of being in Colorado and by the mountains, but I don't love the lack of diversity and the apparent chaos in the Cs department right now.

Thanks in advance!

Health Center Sore Throat Appointment
I've had a pretty bad sore throat for the past 3 days, but when I try to make an appointment at the health center, it seems that they've gotten rid of being able to choose every single symptom related to covid (including sore throat) in order to make an appointment, and that I have to call in order to make one. Does anyone know if they'll require me to take a covid test before going? I recently had covid and I am pretty sure I don't have it right now, as I think I might have strep throat or a bacterial throat infection. Just curious as to why they did this and if it will be harder to get an appointment.

Hey guys,

Wondering if anyone know exactly what date they release the transfer early action decisions. I read somewhere it was today, April 19, I still haven't gotten any email.

Anyone know where I can obtain some UMD terp masks, the ones they gave away for COVID?
Somehow I managed to misplace my masks that I got for free(the black ones they gave away). A grandparent of mine is wanting to obtain one, and I am also wanting to get one so that we can wear them together at graduation. Does anyone know where I can get one? Am I able to buy one?

It's okay if I can't get one; I can always just order a UMD one online, but I am hoping I can get one if possible. Thanks!

GA Grant
Hello!

I have been stressing out about this grant because the only way I will be able to afford UMD is if i get it. I have a few questions. 

Currently, my "Check Application Status" tab only states that I need to turn in "Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)" and "High School Transcript (must include) 1st semester grades from Senior Year" for the GA grant. Both of these are marked on time and accepted. However, I have seen people that needed to turn in a lot more to be considered such as the low income form, dependent verification form, and so on. Should I be concerned that my checklist didn't tell me to submit these items? Is it a matter of just waiting now?

Also can someone please let me know when they received their EA grant AND GA grant respectively? I keep checking my portal but nothing is changing and I know i need to wait longer but I don't know what time frame i should be keeping an eye out for before i should be getting concerned.

Also, has anyone been in the case where they were qualified but NOT awarded? I am afraid that I won't get this money and I know there is an appeal process and everything but I just want to make sure I do everything right the first time to avoid any troubles.

Thank you for your help!

How is PHYS141/142 in the Summer w/ Dr. Shabnam Jabeen and Hailu Gebremariam?
Would appreciate any information or feedback regarding PHYS141/142 in the summer, even if it wasn't with these specific professors. Was the class easy or hard? I heard that the lab is a joke, but I don't want to take just one person's word for it. I will admit that I haven't heard great things about Gebremariam, but I still want to get multiple opinions. Thanks!

in-state re-classification after freshman year
My daughter got admitted to fall 2021 as out of state. Out of state tuition (\~38K) is  not affordable to us. My employer has an office in Maryland and I am exploring options to relocate to MD. If we establish primary residence in MD for a year, is it possible to request re-classification for in-state tuition in sophomore or junior year ?

FedEx to expedite my transcript for this spring
Hi everyone,
I‚Äôm planning on sending out a transcript as soon as this semester ends (I saw that final grades are due may 24th, would this be when my spring transcript is ready?)

On testudo, I saw that we can expedite our transcript by sending the registrar a prepaid fedex label. Does anyone have experience with this? Also does anyone know when spring final transcripts will be available to be sent? I need to do this ASAP (for context, I‚Äôm applying to transfer, and the other school has a document deadline of June 1st, which is why I‚Äôm concerned with the timing / dates of everything)


Thanks

Transferring in spring
Hello so 
I plan on transferring to UMD for spring as I want a better shot of getting in.. however when I apply I won‚Äôt have my associates and I‚Äôll be three classes away from getting it but would have to wait and delay my application. Should I just go ahead and apply and transfer credit by credit which I‚Äôve done pretty well or finish getting the associates and then transfer? I‚Äôm a bit confused as to how it works and what would be preferred. Also if I don‚Äôt have an associates how will my electives be considered?

Need Letters of Support for Campus-wide Slack license
Thousands of students, faculty and staff at this university use Slack, the majority on free plans. Students use Slack for courses, group work, research labs, and club/social organization and communication. These groups quickly outgrow Slack's free plan, and paid Slack plans are expensive. The University's network acceptable use policy also does not allow the use of free Slack plans for official university business. I am putting together a proposal to have the university pay for a campus-wide license for Slack and I would appreciate any letters of support from students who use Slack (whether you have outgrown it or not). The letters don't have to be long, a one line email can be enough, as long as it shows clear student support.

&#x200B;

The best way to submit a letter is to email me: \[my\_reddit\_username\]@umd.edu

The deadline to submit letters is 5 PM on Thursday.

&#x200B;

Thanks.

Information Science Majors: Tell a Freshman about your path!
Hey everyone,

I'm currently a freshman in Letters and Sciences taking CMSC132. Recently, I decided to switch majors to Information Science. I know that I should definitely look into getting internships, but I also have some questions for current information science majors or graduates. For starters, are there any recommendations for another major/ a minor that complement the info sci major well? I want to avoid math, if at all possible. I only found a couple of pretty weak threads in this subreddit about a similar topic, so please, let me know. Also, any info science graduates/anyone who has gotten job offers, I would appreciate it if you told me about your general path to getting to where you're at, or any advice at all! Thanks!

I have two classes I need to take next semester to graduate, but CMSC412's discussion conflicts with the lab section for the 2nd class. Trying to see if there's any way I would be able to request permission to take conflicting classes. How important is the discussion section to doing well in the class?

If anyone else switched majors into cs, could you tell me when you did it? (Ex. Spring sophomore yr) Thank you so much.

Any success making a vaccination appointment after pre-registering?
So I pre-registered here (https://onestop.md.gov/govax) on April 8th and have yet to receive a notification. Have any of you successfully booked an appointment after pre-registering and if so, how long did it take before you were notified? Anyone else having the same experience as me? Thanks fellow terps.

Edit1: I took /u/Quirky_Bumblebee_461 's advice and was able to schedule an appointment directly through a Pharmacy (CVS)

Edit2: Turns out the health department tends to only place calls (no email or text) and those calls may go straight to spam (as it did in my case). Thanks to /u/cubenerd01 for pointing that out. So make sure you check all your calls, even those blocked!

Meal Plan question

CMSC 132: Herman or Pedram?
Hey so i am registering for next semester. I am in a 131 with pedram right now and I like him. He has been good to me, however, I could see how his lectures could become really dry in person because he talks so slow and his voice is so monotone. I watch his lectures in 1.75 speed so its better. 

I have also read that Herman can be a bit douchey. How do you guys feel? Any advice?


edit:I ended up picking herman

CMSC216 Exemption Exam?
Hey guys, as someone with no prior C programming experience (only vaguely C++, and lot of Java and python), how difficult is the exemption exam for 216?

Any tips or advice on how to study for the exam would also be greatly appreciated! 

Thanks!

Freshmen CMSC 132 Exemption Exam?
I am an incoming freshman and I got into UMD for letters and sciences. When doing research on the college I saw that there were exception exams for a couple of courses. To get into the CS major I need to have:

* Completion of CMSC 131 or CMSC 133 with a minimum grade of C-
* Completion of CMSC 132 with a minimum grade of C-
* Completion of MATH 140 with a minimum grade of C-
* A minimum grade point average of 2.7 in all courses taken at the University of Maryland and all other institutions

 I already got a 5 on the AP calc BC exam and AP CS exams so I have credit for CMSC 131 and  MATH 140. I saw that there was an exemption exam for CMSC 132 and I took courses in my high school that covered part of that course so I was wondering if I should take it.

The reason why I want to take this course is that I heard that ppl in the CS major get priority for course selection and I don't want to not be able to take CMCS 132 and be held back a semester.

My doubts about taking this exam are that I know its an important course, idk if I will be able to take CMSC 216 (Introduction to Computer Systems) first semester cuz I'm technically not in the CS major, and it might be better to go the normal path and just get a better GPA and understand the concept better.

&#x200B;

 TL;DR

Incoming freshman in letters and science wondering if he should take the CMCS 132 exemption exam.

Fall Semester
Hi! I was wondering what is the likelihood of any of these scenarios happening. Or if any of these things have happened to anyone. I‚Äôm on a tight schedule next semester and I just want to be prepared for any surprises! 

1) Class location changes (to another building) 

2) A course will change its delivery format listed for Fall 2021. (Example: an online course turns into in-person course) (I‚Äôm aware that more courses could become online due to the pandemic but I‚Äôm more concerned with online courses become in-person) 

3) A course being canceled because of lack of enrollment in the course (specific to Fall or Spring Semesters). (Example: The course capacity is 30 but 10 students sign up)

&#x200B;

I‚Äôd appreciate any answers. I‚Äôm just hoping for a smooth transition next semester:)

Marching Band Time Commitment
Hey there, so I'm a rising sophomore interested in joining the MSOM. I saw on the website that I'd have to register for both MUSC229F and MUSC229G, but I'm worried about the timeslots. For MUSC229F it's MWF 3pm-5pm, and MUSC229G is Tu 7pm-9pm. There's another class that I really wanna take that runs on Wednesdays at that time, and I don't know if I can join MSOM because of that.

Is the band really 8 hrs a week and during those time slots? Or are those just approximate time slot holders? I wanna join but I'm worried about homework and probably having class during those times, and also about having a social life outside of  band. Also, why do I have to sign up for 2 classes?

Smith/Accounting Students: How to Get Involved?
I just got into Smith for accounting and am going to be living right off campus for the Fall 2021 semester (rising junior). It took me a little longer than I expected to figure out what I want to do so I don't want to waste any more time. Smith students, what clubs/organizations/programs do you recommend for getting involved, gaining experience, meeting people/networking, etc? It can be accounting-related or just general business/networking.  

I've been exclusively on Zoom for the whole pandemic. I only saw VMH as an Accounting I  student, when I still wasn't sure that I even wanted to go into business. So I'm a little out of touch with everything going on in Smith. 

Also, I don't know anything about the business frats but am interested in learning about them. Any advice?

TL;DR: Just accepted into the business school for accounting, looking for ways to get involved, gain experience, and meet people.

Banneker vs Frederick Douglass
I don't remember when, but I saw a post talking about how Banneker Key recipients, could kind of cheat the system such that they don't have to be full-time students on their last (year/semester) of being enrolled at UMD but they will still receive financial support as they normally would for their courses. I was wondering if anyone has any information about this but for the Frederick Douglass Scholarship. I'm currently going to be going into my second year of the scholarship, which is also the last year that this scholarship lasts. I don't want to take random Gen-Ed courses to fulfill my 30 credits requirement. If anyone has any information or resources that I could use to find out my answer to this, that'd be great!
