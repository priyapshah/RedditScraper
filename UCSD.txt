Got rejected and planning to appeal
Hello, I got rejected by UCSD I am in art major and I am planning to appeal, I want to know more about the appeal process and how to answer those appeal questions 🥲🥲🥲
--------------------------------------------------
Is UCSD the next CMU?
With UCSD being already one top of the school's in computer science research and UC Berkeley reducing their CS student body significantly(they are considering doing a direct to CS) starting next year, I assume many top students will end up attending UCSD, therefore UCSD will rise in CS rankings.

What do you guys think?
--------------------------------------------------
cse 105 [RANT]
I absolutely had it with this class.
Currently taking CSE 105 with Kyle Phillips Meyer and he is definitely the worst professor I have ever taken.

Lectures are extremely disorganized, his hand writings are compatible to a preschooler's writing, homeworks are marked down for the tiniest mistakes, his lectures are the reason why I sleep in class, and so many more.

Is anyone else taking CSE 105 Kyle Meyer? I am going to drop out from this class. I have never taken a class this shitty before.
--------------------------------------------------
What do ya'll think? I am personally offended by the name tbh /s.

--------------------------------------------------
FAFSA and Housing
I’m a new student and I put on my FAFSA that I would be off campus at UCSD, i’m aware the housing deadline is coming up soon, but i’m finding difficulties in finding an apartment for cheap or roommate off campus, if I were to switch and end up getting a dorm would this mess with my financial aid and have any complications?
--------------------------------------------------
To Mac Users at ERC
Does anyone else's Mac crash multiple times a day because of the wifi?
--------------------------------------------------
Switching to Math-CS within math major
Hopefully, if I get into UCSD next year, I'll transfer in as a regular Math major. I just wanted to know whether I would still be able to switch to math-cs once I get in. Per the UCSD transfer requirements, the minimum reqs for both math and math-cs are the same, so I'm hoping I'll still have the option to switch. I know it's possible to switch rn, but I'm Just worried about next year considering how impacted cs related subjects have been getting.
--------------------------------------------------
Missed deadline to order grad regalia. Any other way to order it?
So long story short, I missed the deadline to place the order for the regalia. Is there any other place that still sells them? Jostens said that now that the deadline is missed, the delivery will be after the event. Is there hope or should I abandon it entirely?
--------------------------------------------------
Is there any places to help out with using arcgis?
I know this is an extremely specific question, but last quarter I took USP4 where we worked with arcgis, and got really into it. I'm not a USP major, and I don't know if USP are the only classes where we'll encounter arcgis. So does anyone know like any opportunities to work with Arcgis like helping out with research (or even internships if we're lucky enough).
--------------------------------------------------
Can't buy Cap and Gown?
Today's the last day to order a cap and gown for commencement, but I can't find it. The link on the bookstore website doesn't lead to me to buy the cap and gown.

Can anyone help me???
--------------------------------------------------
Can anyone tell me wear I could find skirts and thigh highs near campus?
Hello. I went to Westfield UTC recently because I thought I could get all the clothes that I wanted, but I only found 1 of the three things I wanted and it was really hard to just find that one thing. I don’t think I even saw thigh highs and I forget if I just didn’t see skirts or if it just wasn’t what I wanted. I am pretty tall (I think 5’11 was the last time I was measured), skinny, and am biologically male. Any good place for me to find thigh highs and skirts near the campus?
Edit: I’d like to have a plain black skirt.

Yonsei UCEAP Fall 2021?
Hey all,


Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but is anyone planning on studying abroad at Yonsei with UCEAP this upcoming fall semester (fall 2021)? I applied a few weeks ago and am waiting for the official acceptance, so I’m really hoping to get to know some of the folks that are going!

And I’ve been driving myself crazy with anticipation and the lack of info, so I’m also open to any info on how fall 2021 Yonsei might work.

Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------
Proofreading and using grammarly
For my midterm I have to write an essay. I want my friend to proofread my essay, but since it’s my midterm should I ask my professor or ta for permission/do I include them under acknowledgments? Also if I use grammarly do I have to include it in my paper?
--------------------------------------------------
I now think of time in quarters thanks to the quarter system. But please help me make it make sense because I am confused.
Okay we have ten weeks in every quarter + one for finals so that's 11 total.

There are four quarters, one for each season so that means 44 total for college.

But there's 52 weeks in a year so subtracting 44 from that means there are 8 weeks where we are not in any quarter.

Where TF are those 8 weeks?

And furthermore, why am I thinking this hard about this when I have a week's worth of notes to do at minimum.
--------------------------------------------------
W on Transcript
Hi, there! I'm taking CSE 140L this quarter, and I currently plan to drop it. But now it only allows drop with W so I'm wondering if it has any affect, especially I'm for aiming some top grad schools. I also dropped a course with W when I was freshman, but neither that course nor CSE 140L was my major course. I really want to save time for my GRE prep and research, so it's kinda hard to make a choice. Any advice for that?

Fall in-person classes
We know that vaccines are highly effective, and UCSD will mandate all students to get vaccinated, why would we still need to wear masks sitting through classes for 4+ hours everyday? Anyone has any scientific studies that answer this?

Waitlist number
Hi everyone, I'm a recent waitlisted transfer hoping to get into UCSD (currently attending UCSC). I was wondering if there was a way to see what waitlist spot I am at if there is any.
--------------------------------------------------
Financial Aid Offer
I'm checking the portals for my brother as he is not available so don't mind the UCLA stuff on my account.

My question is, the financial aid offer was not available and I don't know why. Did you guys also come up with this issue @transfers? My brother has gotten financial aid offers from other schools (UCs) and his FAFSA has UCSD listed as well... what should I do?
--------------------------------------------------

To people who lived on campus with a therapy cat, what was your experience?
I've been really struggling this over this past year in the dorms and I was considering trying to get a therapy cat. I'm worried about the cat in the small space of the dorm and finding housing that allows animals when I eventually move off campus. What was your experience like and do you recommend getting a therapy animal?

Computer Science (CS) Transfer 3 Year Plan, Need Advice
&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Current Class Plan](https://preview.redd.it/zowdzg563lw61.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=99ab94ca119ae3ea98f3d1e9d88a1838f7e3d627)

Hi guys! I am newly admitted transfer to Sixth College as a CS major, I am planning to take 3 years to graduate and would like some advice.

Some info:

All quarters except the last will be at least 12 units

No pre-req issues with the non-elective classes

Taking Japanese since I want to learn it

Trying to have 9 hours of sleep most nights and 9 hours a week for working out

Joining the toastmasters and still would like to have free time

I will also be focusing on internship-hunting during the fall, thus fall quarters are lighter

I am aiming for a 3.0 - 3.5

Questions:

1. Will the first quarter be too heavy as I am settling into UCSD? I don't want to be overwhelming myself off the bat and I will also be doing internship-hunting.
2. Is it easy to get an extra 3-4 quarters extension approved by Sixth in my case?
3. Especially for my first year, any insight on class choices or course load?
4. Any other general advice or things I am missing?

Thanks in advance!

Any Fall 2021 Mechanical Engineering Freshmen here?!

Looking for a Calculus, Chemistry, English or Biology tutor?
 Hello Everyone,

I'm interested in hiring a tutor in the following areas(Calculus, Chemistry, Biology, or English). I'm willing to offer a base rate of $30/hr but am willing to negotiate. Please DM me if you are interested.

Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------
This year flew by really quickly.
I guess people say this every year, so 🤷‍♀️.

It still feels like Fall quarter was just a couple weeks ago, and we just started Winter Quarter.

It's kind of hard to believe that two quarters have already passed this year, and we're halfway through Spring already. It's the final quarter of the year for most of us, and for most seniors, it's our final quarter of undergrad.

That went by really fast.

Maybe it's because I didn't go to most of my live classes, so this year feels like I had fewer classes.

EDIT: I think it felt so fast because I didn't go to most of my classes. Aside from course registration on Webreg, midterms, and finals, I'd only hear the professor's name like five times the whole quarter. So come finals, I'd still be hearing the professor's name for only the fifth or sixth time, and that made classes feel really short. I don't know if that makes any sense, but I think that is the reason for why this year felt so short to me.

Any other transfers waitlisted out there?
For any enrolled students who got off the waitlist: how long did it take? It says it could go until late July to notify--is this typical?

Anxious out here... I got into some other good schools but I'd really prefer to attend ucsd.
--------------------------------------------------
Difficulty of upper division biology courses?
How are the upper divs at UCSD? Do students really struggle in their classes? Are students willing to help out one another or are they constantly at each others’ throats? And, are professors willing to help/easily reachable?

Thank you and any input is much appreciated! :)

Minimum progress requirement
Is minimum progress required to graduate?

I’m a rising senior, easily able to graduate, and so I’ve been taking it easy. However, I wasn’t aware of the minimum progress requirement and I haven’t met it. 

I’m totally panicking because I have a job offer lined up and this would be the last point I could fuck everything up. I don’t know if I can wait until Monday for academic advising to open. Does anyone know?

Transfer Data Analytics major (poli sci dept)
Hello, transfers!!! I just got in as a Data Analytics major in the poli sci dept (I SIR'd right away cause it was my top choice). If any of you intend to enroll this fall with that major, comment below. I also plan on adding the [Computational Social Science minor](https://css.ucsd.edu) (here's their GitHub: [CSS 1](https://github.com/JohnSerences/CSS1_Winter2021), [CSS 2](https://github.com/garrettswan/CSS2_Spring2021)) to enhance my data analytics skills in Python.

Question about quality of student life from a transfer student
 I was just accepted as a transfer into UCSD today and am trying to decide between here and UC Davis. I've been browsing the top posts of the subreddits the past couple hours and have been seeing so many posts about how unhappy many of the students are here at UCSD and I've been getting kinda scared because of it. I was heavily leaning towards coming here as opposed to Davis and wanted to ask for your guys' experiences at UCSD, if you had any advice for a transfer, and if these posts talking about terrible mental health and lack of motivation are exacerbated from COVID rather than being a problem with the school itself. Any response is appreciated!
--------------------------------------------------
I laughed heart fully after a looong time, and my cheeks are cramping
I watched a funny YouTube video and I haven’t laughed so hard in a long time. I realized that because my cheeks literally starting cramping. I didn’t even know that cheeks can cramp. This is funny and sad because my body is telling me that it’s not used to laughing. 

I’ve been very stressed lately and my social anxiety has just been destroying me. I always feel like no one likes me and I feel lonely. I think I don’t look good enough, or am smart enough. People say otherwise, but I don’t believe them. So, this laugh really just hit me hard because I am sacrificing everything for others. I am focusing so much on what other people think about me that I don’t even know who I am anymore.
--------------------------------------------------
idk if this is allowed
idk if this is okay to say, but I rly like UCSD & have met cool ppl here & interesting professors. i also love how the air smells walking around campus when it’s all cold and misty at night. maybe it’s bc i study sociology & theatre & they’re like fun subjects & not stem subjects like smart ppl. i dunno. okay bye 🥺 *virtual hug*

p.s. i agree that the food is v bad except the fries but i’ll die from fatness, & the ppl who run the indi music radio station on campus are the worst
--------------------------------------------------
Might Transfer to another UC any advice please?
I personally didn't have a great time at UCSD (no offense to anyone who enjoys the school) and it might not be right for me. This is still up in the air but between COVID and my bad experiences, I was thinking about transferring (winter quarter since fall quarter has passed) to another UC closer to my home. I know there are plenty of people in this community who have transferred UCs before and I was curious if anyone had some advice. I'd be transferring in as a junior/third year next year. This might be my opportunity to start fresh after the pandemic which has hit my mental health pretty hard. So please let me know what advice you have for making this decision and how your experience went. Thank you!!

Tat for BILD 2
Hello! I was thinking of taking BILD 2 over this summer just so I can be done with lower div bio by fall quarter. The only available professor to teach it for summer session 1 rn  is John Tat but nothing comes up of him teaching that course. I was wondering if anyone has had him for BIMM 110 or any other class? If he’s pretty good I’ll take the class but if not I know I can just wait for fall. Thoughts?
--------------------------------------------------
Major prep transfer advice
I am a Biochem major potentially going to UCSD and wanted to ask how important it is to miss 1 course from the major prep courses. SD said to complete as much as I can (assist.org) so I assume my acceptance will still be valid with only one missing course but I’m not sure. I said I would complete the course in my application but  dropped from the class. I wanted to see if anyone who might have been in my situation had their application rescinded? (I finished physics 1a but not 1b in my cc)
--------------------------------------------------
BILD 3 for Bioinformatics transfer
Hey y’all,

So I’m an inter campus transfer. BILD 3 is equivalent to our BIOE20C, which isn’t particularly required of students outside of ecology or general biology. BILD 2 seems to be the class that’s required for most biology students here, which is BIOE20B, which is developmental biology and physiology. As a bioinformatics student, I haven’t completed BIOE20C. I’m worried about getting my admissions rescinded over this.
--------------------------------------------------
got waitlisted but I'm actually really happy about it :)
Got denied from quite literally every UC and I wasn't even going to check UCSD but to my surprise I got waitlisted (I am just here to manifest)! I go to ucsc right now...pls god no more banana slug

Commuting to Campus on a Bicycle
Hi there! I'm going to be living off-campus this coming year and was wondering if any current or previous cycling commuters can give some insight on what it's like to commute to campus from the nearby apartments.

anyone keep plants? :D
was wondering if anyone likes gardening and if anyone keeps plants in dorms-have recently gotten into growing small peppers. How is the sun at UCSD and do some dorms have windows at all/ what’s a good set up? If no windows I might just get a small grow light . might be living campus next yr depending on the waitlist
--------------------------------------------------
Do we have to wear UCSD gowns to commencement?
I asked and the team said they **heavily** recommend it....but I don't want to spend 50$ for a gown with blue sleeves when I can get a regular black one on amazon for 20$. Do you think that they'll be enforcing it strictly at commencement? Sry im broke
--------------------------------------------------
I miss San Diego
I'm an international student. I left San Diego in March 2020 because of COVID. I thought I'd be back by September 2020, then January 2021, and now the earliest I could possibly be back in San Diego is July this year. It's been over a year since I've stepped foot on campus.

I miss it. I miss my friends. Every day it feels like there's a hole in me as I trudge through lectures at 2x speed. I may be "home", but I feel like I left a part of me in San Diego, and I don't feel whole anymore without it.

Am I alone in feeling this way?
--------------------------------------------------
Jury Duty and move-in for Fall.
So I got a LA county jury duty summon back at the start of Winter quarter and postponed it for the summer. Now that it's 100% certain that we're returning in the Fall, I can't stay longer in LA county after late september/early October when school begins at SD. What do I do from here?

\- If I were to postpone it again when it comes, then the next summons lands on a date when I'm living in SD county and thus can't attend. My parents are convincing me to do this, but I want to make sure it's not like, in violation of anything.

\- Do I attend the jury duty summer anyways, and drive the concept home that I cannot be picked bc I'm moving to SD for in 3 months? Worst case scenario is that I get picked and whatever trial I get put into lasts into my move-in date for some offcampus apt.

Idk which choice I should do.

Question About ELWR
Edit/update: For upcoming students who are wondering, I asked the Admissions Office and for the purpose of meeting the ELWR, you CAN send your superscore.

I know that to meet the ELWR, I can do so by scoring 63 or higher on ACT English plus Reading. Do these sections have to be done on the same day? So can I send in my ACT Superscore to meet the ELWR? As I scored 64 on the ACT English test from one date and the ACT Reading test from another date. Thank you!
--------------------------------------------------
Take offer to dorm on campus for the summer?
Hi guys, I'm not a UCSD student but I was offered to live on campus for the summer for an REU I'm participating in. 

For anyone that's lived there, is it worth staying there considering that most of the campus is shut down right now? I love SD and I've been there twice on vacation, but I read on the UCSD website that they have pretty strict covid guidelines for the dorms. I don't want to be locked in my room all summer and have to quarantine for simply eating out. 

Thanks!

Help keep The New Student Guide up-to date
Hello all,

I will be graduating from my master's program this June, and even being a year removed from undergrad (but still attending), I'm already slightly removed from campus policies that will be affecting our new students. For instance, I didn't know much about the rent hike strikes until I saw them on the news, nor did I know about the 2-year guarantee being cancelled until I saw an article in *The Triton*. Additionally, as I get into my professional career, I don't know if I will have the time to keep the guide as up-to-date as I did in previous years.

Therefore, I ask that if [my guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cVRH3wrEK3RQ5OZ9cLyPYhzUTtlkNlxq5W9QEIr_CwM/edit?usp=sharing) ever helped you, that you help carry the torch to ensure it will be updated for future students. Please let me know if you are interested!

Best,

Graduating M.S. Student

summer financial aid
I know I need at least 6 units to receive financial aid/be considered for, but what if I’m enrolled in 4 units and waitlisted for another class? Will financial aid wait until I’m enrolled or will they just not give me anything since it’s below 6? Thanks!
Also I’m waitlisted and am number 6 out of 60 enrolled so I’m assuming the 10% rule will allow me to get in hopefully

will you wear masks when we return in the fall?
I'm wondering if wearing masks will be a regular norm when we return. From what I've learned, there's still some possibility of getting covid after being vaccinated; Plus there's all different variance coming out lately. The idea of squizzing hundreds of students in a room for hours still sounds risky.  Do you expect people to still wear masks in the fall?

Econ research?
Hey guys! Rising senior here looking into schools. I want to be a math econ major with plans to go to grad school (though that plan is subject to change). From what I’ve seen, the math econ program here is quality, but I have one major qualm about the school. I saw that Econ research is extremely difficult to come by here compared to some other schools. Is this true because if it is, that would be really unfortunate as ease of research opportunities for econ is one of my main priorities in a school.

How do people who are not living in San Diego now look for housing?
I assume an important element of looking for off-campus housing is to see the apartment yourself before signing anything because nothing beats an in-person inspection of the unit. I assume people will be inspecting the neighborhood, spaces, furnitures, etc) because not everything online is believable or because you’ll get a different feeling when touring in-person. But because of COVID, many of us are not living in San Diego at the moment (especially international students and OOS students). How would you suggest us when looking for off-campus housing? Is it safe that we only see the apartment’s photos before signing the lease? Also, how would you recommend OOS students when it comes to looking for roommates via Facebook? Do you meet your potential roommate candidates in-person before deciding that you want to live with them? Any tips on how to do that remotely? Also, how to increase my chance of being selected by strangers as their roommates other than saying that I’m clean, etc? Do they often conduct “vibe check”? 

Sorry there are many questions. I am just very stressed about the living situation next year😖

Thank you!

Concerns about failing a class (twice, kinda)
This is about MCWP 50. I attempted it last quarter and dropped it with a W because I felt extremely overwhelmed and did very poorly on the assignments. I'm attempting it again this quarter but, due to stress and also negligence, I've missed a few big deadlines and I'm afraid that I'm already in danger of failing. My first question is, is office hours a valid place to bring up this concern? Secondly, if I do fail this time, will anything prevent me from taking the class a third time (and will it reflect on me very poorly)? My last concern is that I'm entering junior year next quarter, and I know you're supposed to complete MCWP by the end of sophomore year, so I'm also unsure if that places me in a bad situation :/

Med students please help!
 So, typically, when a person inserts a foreign object into their body (i.e an insulin needle), it gets rejected by the body which is why the location of the needle must be changed every 3 days or so... knowing this, do defibrillators also get attacked by white blood cells, or rejected in general? If not, why tho.

incoming third-year housing concerns
as title says, i’m about to be an incoming third-year by the time fall 2021 quarter starts and i have no idea what to do for housing. 
i only got to live on campus for around 6 months as a first year before i had to move back home and because of the pandemic, i’ve currently spent basically all of my second year at home.

i haven’t seen much for housing regarding people in a similar situation like me, and i was wondering what to do?? 

especially because i think any on-campus housing for me is basically non-existent so i would have to look for off-campus housing but i just don’t know and it’s stressing me out on top of other school things :”)

COGS ML vs. Design and INteraction
Hey everyone!

I am currently a COGS ML major, but I really don't care for all the math, and on top of that, I am intending on pursuing web development anyway, so I was wondering if it is a good idea to switch to Design, given I can take the time to build my portfolio instead of classes I don't really care about or will honestly use anyway. On the other hand, though, IDK if having ML on my degree will make more money after uni.

Thank you for the advice!

Should I file the DDA after my minor is approved?
I slacked off and waited until my last quarter of undergrad to declare my minors. I had already completed all the requirements, but was always too lazy to go through the Major/Minor tool on MyTritonLink. One of them already got approved by both the department and by Revelle.

I declared the other minor on Monday and it was approved by the department today. After the department had approved my first minor, Revelle took two extra weeks to approve it. It’s still my fault for procrastinating so hard, but it might be a few more weeks before Revelle confirms this one.

What if, come May 19th, it’s still pending?

Would it be wise to file the DDA before Revelle approves my pending minor?

Second question..I know that everyone gets two invites but my boyfriend of 4 years has been with me through the beginning. He’s seen me struggle from CC and make out to the top at UCSD. My parents are a given for graduation; they’re priority but I would love my supportive boyfriend to go as well. Would that be possible? 

Thanks and good luck with the rest of your spring quarter :)

Edit: RA’s are able to choose people to live with them regardless of college or guarantee status.

Housing Frustration- incoming second year
Any other current on-campus first-years extremely frustrated with the housing situation? For those of us who moved in after fall quarter, it feels unfair to know that we're not in any priority group for second-year housing despite having signed a housing contract at some point. I understand there's limited space but it feels almost like I got duped with the idea that I would retain a housing guarantee if I moved in at some point during this year. 

Personally, the whole idea for me was that if I moved in after fall quarter I could have a better understanding of COVID once I was on campus in the later months AND that I would still be guaranteed housing next year. It was a huge factor in choosing whether or not to live on campus in the subsequent quarters because financially it wasn't ideal to move, but I still pushed for it because I was under the assumption it was going to give me some sort of priority for the coming year. Overall, just very annoyed at the whole situation lol feels like I've been let down by the university somehow. Not sure if that's just me being angry in the heat of the moment, or if others feel like this too

Next year 21-22 I will be a second year and I was wondering what should I do. I’ve heard a couple of people talk about on campus apartments and off campus apartments. (How hard is it to get one? If I have a group of friends can I live with them on a on campus one?) but I was also wondering about dorms are 2nd years aloud to dorm? (Is it worth it as a 2nd year who hasn’t lived on campus to dorm I prefer apartments). Anything helps

housing
Hi everyone, 

So I was living off-campus for 2020-21 because I was in an international location when the pandemic began and I couldn't leave my family. Now that HDH isn't guaranteeing those who weren't on campus, I'm not sure I would even be able to live on-campus. I still can't come back until late May and I've never even been to the San Diego area so I have virtually no idea how I would even look for off-campus housing. I also noticed that rents are being hiked and most leases are being signed around this time.  I wouldn't be able to split to house/rent with anyone as I haven't made friends close enough to share a home with (lol nice way of saying online school has blocked me from making friends). I really don't know what to do or where to start. 

Please help :/ thank youu

Graduating Senior Looking to Give back :)
TLDR: Anyone/Everyone who wants to explore SD/Meet new people/have someone to talk to, please HMU I will cover transportation, planning, and probably costs too! Tell your friends! Freshman, Seniors, transfers, non-students anyone!

Hey all, I’ve been active on this Subreddit for sometime, and it’s helped me out with a lot of shit and helped me meet tons of new people. The pandemic has been hard for all of us, especially in the social aspect, I wanted to do something about that.

For some context on me, I’m a BA/MIA at UCSD’s School of Global Policy &amp; Strategy. I spent 3 yrs of undergrad at UCSD and will continue for 2yrs of Grad school here. I’m fully vaccinated (as of February) and get tested every 2 weeks. 

I have a car and I know S.D. better than most. If you’re lonely, bored, sad, excited, or whatever please hit me up to hang out, play sports, video games, I don’t care!

I met someone early on during undergrad from Reddit which opened some social doors for me and I want to do the same for anyone/everyone here! 

You don’t gotta worry about planning anything or transportation, heck even if you’re going through financial worries, I got you! I see too many sad covid posts and I want to do some part in helping alleviate that before I graduate!

I’d prefer to keep total numbers to 2-3 (including me) at a time while wearing masks but yah! I can show the y’all parking tips and tricks, cool ass roof top bars, best on campus place to poop 😳, downtown artsy spots, how to skate/snorkel, anything! Hopefully I’ll learn or see something new myself! 

I want to be as inclusive as possible, and make this as good as an experience for everyone/anyone :), I’ll check back to this post in a few days, in the meantime hope to hear from y’all either through DM or comments or better yet hang out in person!


Edit: Just fixed my chat function thingy, didn’t know it wasn’t open to DMs LOL sorry

Look out for scams via text messages
As most of you know, there was a large data breach (refresher: [https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2021/04/frequently-asked-questions-about-the-accellion-data-breach.html](https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2021/04/frequently-asked-questions-about-the-accellion-data-breach.html))

I have been getting an uptick of texts (SMS) to my phone that are clearly scams. The latest was a bot pretending to be some woman that I matched with on Tinder. They changed up the intro to make it seem similar to mine as well (think Blake versus Jake). I'm gay as fuck, so that didn't really work on multiple levels. For the straight guys, it might have. Especially if you had been using Tinder as of late. Likewise, I've been getting some texts to do random surveys from sketchy as fuck urls. Again, please do not engage or click on the links.

So yeah, please be really weary of any phone numbers messaging you on WhatsApp or text that you do not recognize. More than likely, it's some sort of scam. And as always, if anyone needs your credit card to "verify" your age, it's a scam. And no, the hot person messaging you is not interested in you.

EDIT: Also, I've been getting car quotes, so keep an eye out for that too. If anyone else has seen an uptick in scams, comment them please. It's a good idea to know what to look for, given that scammers will use the same database to troll through.

2. Filed my DDA. I have no idea if it was "successful" just submitted it a long time ago.

I still have to:

1. Register for the in-person ceremony and get that negative covid test.

I have no outstanding dues.

Is this really it? Anything else? I have that bad feeling I'm forgetting something...

mae staying extra yr?
currently an mae third hear and was originally hoping to graduate in 4 yrs, but some things popped up that made me to widthdraw a from a few classes. I can really grind over the summer/beginning of 4th year to catch up, which I would normally do, but ive been also dealing with mental issues for a while now that have gotten really bad recently. I was hoping to take a 5th year to spread out my courses, especially the lab and project courses to really focus on them, and take things easy to possibly help sort out my mental health. but this also brings up the issue of needing to take random courses in order to be considered full time for financial aid, as i dont have that much mae classes left bc i was grinding to graduate in 4 years; and was probably planning to take on an easy minor but not sure if this is the right route. to be honest, i might be leaning towards a choice already, but would greatly appreciate any input on how to plan for a fifth year, any easy minors or any pros/cons of taking an extra year.(srry for the rant, im losing my minding stressing about this haha)

What's the point in making exams so long that it is impossible to complete within the given time limit ??
Isn't the whole point to test whether students have grasped the concepts?

 If someone understands all the concepts yet cant complete the questions in time, that is def not a good test of one aptitude. I really wish some of these professors wouldn't punish students who actually put in work like this smh 🤦.  Worse yet I've had professors who boast that "most students wouldn't be able to complete my exams on time." WHYYY?? WHAT IS THE POINT ??

Has anyone heard from UCSD?
I heard that UCSD was sending transfer decisions in batches this week. Has anyone heard back yet?
--------------------------------------------------
Request for Advice
I kinda just need some big brother/sister advice right now.
I am a high school senior deciding where to go for college. I have talked to so many people, gotten perspectives, advice, and etc. 

UCR: computer science (no debt +priority course registration) and I can commute.
UCI: computer science (15-20k debt after 4 years)
UCSD: got my alt major - computational physics: which is mostly physics with 1 programming class and 3 CSE electives. (20k debt)

I am aware that switching to computer science at UCSD is a lottery system and the odds are not in my favor. If I go, I would need to be 100% committed to physics but try to use my degree as a "back door" to the tech industry. And I realize now that I am not enjoying learning E and M right now in high school.

Although I have never visted campus, nor been to San Diego, I just get this feeling that I could be happy there (and maybe very stressed too). 

My question is: Is it really worth the risk to go for a degree that is not as straightforward, or do I just go for the safer path?
I feel like taking the safe path is looked down upon these days. I don't know why, but it feels exciting to take the least logical path - which is going to UCSD. 

My high school counselor was saying to take the safe path because I told him that my parents cannot support my college tuition. 


In general: is the "screw it, we are young, let's do it" mentality worth it here?
--------------------------------------------------
Anyone want to co-work together?
Hey guys, I'm Jerry, and I've been working on my computer alone every day, feeling isolated and unmotivated 😤

If anyone else is in the same boat, my friend Maddie and I are making a tight-knit group of accountability buddies with people from UCSD, UCB, Stanford, Google, etc. (students & remote workers). When we're working we can drop into a co-working cafe with a buddy or two, using a Chrome extension we made.

If you're interested in joining the group, add your name here :D https://forms.gle/FwRKceqf5pitJgMH7
--------------------------------------------------
taking all my classes p/np
So, I'm only taking 3 courses this quarter and for some reason I'm finding it really difficult to stay motivated and have missed/failed multiple assignments. Given the p/np exception we have for this quarter (where it won't count towards the 25%) could I theoretically take all my classes for p/np? This may sound really dumb or wasteful but I can't imagine doing well in any of them and I'd like to retain my somewhat decent gpa. Also if it is possible, would this a bad look?

Pls explain data breach
Little late to the game but wanted to know if someone can explain the data breach. Is everyone impacted or is it just some ppl that got emails/ got money taken. I didn’t get any emails/ spam emails at all like how other ppl here have posted. Everything seems fine for me so that’s why I wanted to ask just to reassure myself

housing for senior transfer

How time consuming is Cogs 18?
I want to get some programming experience with Python so I'm thinking about taking Cogs 18 in the fall. I know that generally programming courses are quite time consuming so I was wondering if it'll be a bad idea to take it alongside both Math 142a and Math 102. I could p/np it as it does not fulfill any requirement for me other than an elective.
--------------------------------------------------
What are some things you will personally do differently after the pandemic?
True story. In my first year at UCSD, this cute sorority girl was always trying to hang out with me. I used to get coffee with her at least twice a week, including every Saturday. If I couldn't make it, then she'd text me nonstop to ask when I would be free.

Then something happened and we stopped seeing each other.... we turned our group project in.

That's the kind of thing I probably won't do post-pandemic. I don't think I'll be meeting people for group projects, when it's so much more convenient to do it virtually.

What will you personally do differently after the pandemic?

1) I will keep a mask with me, just in case I see someone coughing or whatever. I probably won't be wearing it though most of the time.

2) I will keep hand sanitizer with me at all times. I already used to keep it in my backpack, but sometimes I'd run out and forget to refill it. Post pandemic, I'll probably be in the habit of using it, so I'll know when to get it refilled.

3) Boring meetings that can be held virtually will be held virtually. Unfortunately, being assigned to work on group projects with cute girls won't be as exciting anymore, because we won't be getting coffee together on weekends, but we will get to save a lot of time. If we have a presentation, we might meet up for a practice run.

4) I won't go shopping as frequently for clothes. Westfield UTC being right next to my apartment in Costa was not a combination that helped me save money. I have learned though that I really don't need to buy new clothes every season. My winter clothes from last year can easily be recycled next winter. I suppose this might have already been obvious for some people.

5) I will cherish human moments. Sharing a laugh in a Zoom call was so exciting and memorable this year, because it was the only human interaction I got sometimes. I vividly remember a lame joke I told in March, because three other people on the Zoom call laughed at it. When you're allowed to hug again, I will not take hugs for granted. It's like appreciating water when you haven't been able to drink any for an entire day.

6) **[EDIT: Adding this one]** I will pay closer attention to what I actually missed. I saw a YouTube video in which a vlogger goes to school for a day, and this is her first time in a classroom since dropping out to become a full time YouTuber. At one point, she was listing out what she missed about being in school, and one of the things she said was the feeling of waiting for class to end. It’s weirdly exciting to say “it’s 11:45 and I can’t wait until noon. I’ll be free from this lecture and I wonder what I should have for lunch.” No one actually says that out loud, but I think a lot of people are probably thinking something along those lines. When you get to do something for the first time after so long, you might realize you missed some things you weren’t expecting to miss. All I’m saying here is that I’ll be more cognizant of trying to pick up on what I missed.

Why UC San Diego ?
I'm currently deciding between UCSB, UCI, and UCSD as a poli-sci major  (probably gonna switch to a double-major in physics and philosophy). I'm  doing more research into the different programs and academic  experiences at each school, but from the perspective of a current  student, what are some intangible parts of UCSD that make it worth going  to?
--------------------------------------------------
Best running path?
I am looking for a good route to go running . I prefer empty or less crowded paths . Thanks
--------------------------------------------------
Am I gonna have no life??
ok nobody else seems to be concerned about this, but i was hoping a current student would have an answer to is it actually “socially dead”? i understand there is stuff to do and you simply have to work harder to make friends. but like if i wanted to go to parties and drink some weekends, would i be able to do that. i don’t think i’m the person who wants to party every day, but i have always wanted that traditional college experience with frat parties and like some good wasted stories that i’ll be able to tell. Ucsd is really good for my major and i love that part so much, but i also don’t wanna throw away my whole college experience and have it be solely about academics.

And how do you manage these difficult courses? STEM or non-STEM. Random thought in my head as I procrastinate on work. I'm an alumni so its been a while since I've learned things in a classroom. I started reminiscing about college life and how much I kinda miss it minus the midterms and finals stress.

Does this have a plastic layer over the paper so it preserves the paper over the decades? It should offer the same protection as the frame, right?

Living On-Campus Next Year
I'm an incoming sophomore looking to dorm next year however I don't know where to get started. I lived at home all this year so I don't get the housing guarantee.

63 on Math 180A midterm.... FUCK
Dude I studied SO fucking much and I was getting problem after problem in the text book right too. On the practice midterm I got a 100, a 100 on the last homework and then... FUCKKKKK 63.

I thought I did really good too and felt like I knew everything but NOPEEEE.

Still a midterm and a final left though so for the remainder of the quarter I’m just going to sacrifice my social life and anything fun I guess...

TLDR: Please consider donating to this fundraiser! The proceeds go to helping support not only the San Diego LGBT Center's HIV Services and Protection Program but also local restaurants that have been hit hard by COVID-19. Any donation of any value is appreciated, but if you donate more than $25 you will be entered into a raffle to win $500 in gift cards to local San Diego eateries! And/or order takeout from any of the participating restaurants 4/29 - 5/2 (visit [thecentersd.org/DOFL](https://thecentersd.org/DOFL)) and 25% of the sale will go to the LGBT Center.

[https://donate.thecentersd.org/team/352793](https://donate.thecentersd.org/team/352793?fbclid=IwAR3pEXYYDEMo4U6px2UtbSsyEHlPrIivPsQwF7cYm62YD49mH8i8rfnG-Eg)

Hi Tritons! My name is Hannah. I'm a fourth-year UCSD student and also a volunteer at the SD LGBT Center located in Hillcrest. As you may or may not know, the LGBT Center offers a lot of resources to not only the LGBT+ community but to San Diego as a whole. One of these resources is their HIV/AIDS Services and Prevention Program. This program offers life-saving services such as free HIV testing, PrEP, support groups and more. Not only that, the LGBT Center also provides breast/chest cancer screenings, immunizations, pap smears, pregnancy tests, and STD tests for free or at a low cost.

In order to maintain the program, they rely on donations from the community. In the past, local SD restaurants have been a huge help in supporting the program. However, because of COVID, it's a little more challenging for restaurants to chip in as normal. So, as a way to support both the small businesses that have been so generous to donate in the past, and to raise funds for the Center, we are putting on a fundraiser where the proceeds will go to both!

The restaurant I am raising funds for alongside the LGBT Center is The Mission, a funky and sweet brunch spot in Mission Beach. They have everything from a wide variety of pancakes to chilaquiles to sandwiches. They also give back to the community with donations to the LGBT Center, San Diego's Literacy Program, the Humane Society and more.

If you'd like for the Center to be able to continue helping keep the San Diego community happy and healthy, as well as support a local restaurant, then please consider donating to the fundraiser using the link below. Any donation of any value is appreciated, but if you donate more than $25 you will be entered into a raffle to win $500 in gift cards to local San Diego eateries!

But wait, there's more! If you eat/order take out from The Mission (or any of the other participating restaurants, visit [thecentersd.org/DOFL](https://thecentersd.org/DOFL)) from 4/29 - 5/2, 25% of the proceeds will go to the LGBT Center as well. And as we approach late spring, there's nothing better than going to a picturesque San Diego park (like Kate Sessions or Balboa!) with a thick stack of pancakes and a cappuccino. 

Thanks for reading! Check out the other restaurants participating and donate to their pages as well by clicking on the donation homepage, and don't forget to visit the Center and take advantage of the resources they offer!!

[Research] Diet, Physical Activity, and Weight Gain during COVID-19 Pandemic Survey (Undergraduate Students in the United States)
Hello everyone!   
My group and I are conducting a study for our Public Health capstone course at UC San Diego and are looking for undergraduate students across the United States to fill out our 5-10 min survey. We are interested in knowing about you diet, physical activity, and weight gain before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our goal is to reach at least 100 responses. We will not ask for any identifying information. We appreciate your time. Thank you in advance!

Easiest major to complete?
I'm a third year and I'm just so burned out. All i wanna do is graduate by at least summer 2022 (it's too expansive for me to stay a fifth year). I JUST became an Anthropology major, but I'm thinking of switching to another major that might be easier for me to graduate? Do any of ya'll have any recs or advice. I'm planning on taking summer courses too so...

Edit: I know what I wanna do after college career-wise and my major doesn't matter at all. I just wanna get OUT.

SIO 139 as Upper Division Bio Elective

Cogsci or Business Econ?
Currently trying to pick a new major and I’ve been interested by cogsci and the new business economics major. I’ve heard cogsci is iffy by some, could you tell me why? Also, what could I do with each major? Is there a benefit to one over the other? Anything helps, thanks!

Edit: What’s the difference between cogsci and data science?

Hang outs?
Good Morning!

I haven't really met anyone on campus, so thought I might say hi here and see if anyone wants to hang! I kinda skate, can kinda play uke/ guitar, and can definitely game but am always up to just walk around! And if any of the veterans here have any ideas for making friends those would be welcome too. Hope everyone has a good day!

Edit: Oh yeah I'm also a CSE major if anyone wants to talk about that (not very experienced though)

Edit 2: I'm also a freshman I should add (Don't know how I forgot that one)
--------------------------------------------------
Is this doable?
So i recently found out I like coding so i wanted to switch into compsci but seeing as it is hard to get into I wanted to have Data Science as a back up. I want to apple to both but I was thinking of apply to data science first in the winter 22 but I need to meet the prerequisite first. For fall I wanted Math 20c ,CSE8b,CSE20  (i could do dsc 10 here or math 18) and for winter (dsc 10 or Math 18) CSE 15L and CSE 12. Is this do able or am I signing myself up for failure.

50,000 Subscribers!
Hello everyone! 

Just wanted to draw attention to the milestone that about to surpass! 50,000 is such a crazy large number... and in terms of traffic stats, this subreddit gets over 2 million views a month typically (often times much more). I know myself and the rest of the mods never would have imagined how fast this subreddit would grow. 

On a personal note, when I first started using this subreddit before the start of my first year in 2018, we only had around 12,000 subscribers. Now, 3 short years later we’re about to surpass 50,000. We passed more subscribers than students a long time ago and are only continuing to grow. 

In this time, this sub has been a great source of entertainment for me and many other students. From chicken sashimi to our feud with UCB to Gary memes, there has always been something interesting going on here. It’s been the go-to information source for a lot of people including myself, especially during the pandemic. 

Looking towards the future, I know myself and the rest of the mod team are looking forwards to continuing trying to make this sub a better place. Hopefully we’ll be able get some more AMAs to happen(if you are a professor or would be of interest to this community please let us know so we can schedule an AMA!). In general, I think our goal is to make this subreddit a more positive place that still allows for the shitposts it is so well known for. 

If you have any favorite posts, feel free to share them below so we can reminisce :)

TEDxUCSD main conference on May 15th-16th: connect with Mayuko Inoue, a software engineer and a UCSD alumina
Our main conference this year -- May 15th and 16th @ 11AM-3PM -- is coming!!!

Focusing on the theme "Constellate" for this conference, we will have **Mayuko Inoue** as one of our speakers and her talking idea is **you deserve to exist and explore who you are, permission to go against the grain and have you define who you are, not anyone else**. Like a brilliant star in the technology industry, Mayuko is always passionate about discussions around mental health, cultural identity, and creating technology with empathy and compassion. Here's a little background about Mayuko: she is a content creator and software engineer. After working in Silicon Valley tech companies like Intuit, Patreon, and Netflix for six years as an iOS Engineer, she became a full-time creator in 2020. Her work aims to help people find their way through the tech industry by sharing her own experience navigating this world through technology, career advice, and lifestyle videos.

As humans, we are always faced with the unknown, but by gathering, we are able to make sense of chaos and give rise to intricate constellations to help us navigate through the dark. The theme "Constellate" also reminds us to embrace the fact that we each have a unique role to play in the shaping of these collective constellations.

So, if this intrigues you, come and join us and Mayuko this May! Zoom preregistration link: [http://bit.ly/Constellatepre-reg](http://bit.ly/Constellatepre-reg)

Bank Account vs Data Breach
So I worked on campus for a few years but when I did the fraud alert sign up, it showed that my SSN and email were compromised. Thankfully none of my bank info showed up. My parents helped me with Tuition, can I sign them up using the same system and double checking their bank info as well? 

&#x200B;

Thanks!

Wifi problem
I’m sorry I know there’s been a flood of posts on wifi problems already but it’s been a couple hours since the latest ones so.... I just want to know, is the wifi fixed for others? I need to start working on an essay and it requires researching primary sources but no webpages and databases and articles are opening. It has all just been loading for the longest time. 

Getting super frustrated because people have deadlines here, man.

Fall schedule void?
Hello Redditors.
The UCSD Fall 2021 schedule says fall quarter ends December 11.
Then it says Winter break starts December 23rd.
Then Winter quarter begins January 3.
So can anyone please tell me,  what the heck happens between December 11 and 23??
Thank you!

Graduate housing lease
Hey! Hope everyone is well. I am an Incoming student for graduate studies (Masters Bioengineering) for year 2021-2022. My program length is exactly 1 year (September2021-June2022). I just applied to the housing waitlist for my desired communities, and I noticed that the housing lease length is 2 years. Since I am only going to be at UCSD for 1 year due to my program length, is there anyway I can opt out of my contract (if given one) after my 1st year? If anyone has any advice on this or previous experience, etc, I would greatly appreciate your help. 
Thank you so much!

Application Status
Hello everyone,

Over the last couple months, I submitted various applications for internships and one of them I got back within like 2 weeks, which was of course a rejection. But all the other ones have not given any further updates, and I am wondering if I'm not even going to get a rejection mail and get ignored or if they are waiting until the application deadline for the updates. This is my first time applying for internships in college, and it would be great if someone can address my concerns. Thank you!

Data Breach
So my bank account info was leaked during the data breach I guess. I woke up last week to my account basically being emptied. I’ve gotten the money back from my bank, and froze everything, but now I’m trying to sign up for the Experian credit tracking, and they’re ‘unable to verify my identity’. Has anyone else had this issue? I know that i’m answering all of the identity questions correct, but I have a suspicion that my frozen bank account might be the problem, since a couple questions ask you to confirm the last 4 digits of your bank account, but i have no clue. any help would be appreciated.

Personal feelings about Professor Dr. Stallings's on his CHEM 6C
Dr, Stallings never post his live lectures on Canvas and his lectures only cover very superficial contents in my PERSONAL view, which is fatal especially in this remote learning quarter. I even have to use my high school AP class notes and works to prepare for this course.

I haven't explicitly told my PI that I'm graduating soon; I'm assuming they read it in my resume. But what if they didn't notice it on my resume? I'm definitely committed to the year of research; that's what I signed up for. But does graduating in 2 months change anything? This is an unpaid position, if that matters.

Renting for the summer (Roommate search)
Hey all. I’m a student looking for housing through the summer anywhere from near the university to Pacific Beach. Ideally a room in a shared house, apartment or condo with people around age 18-25. I’m coming from out of town so I would love to make some connections here. A sublease or just a casually month to month would work perfectly, and I would be out by the time the fall term starts.

Let me know if any of you are looking to fill a room. Feel free to message me if you have questions.

Posted this here but give me a heads up if there's a platform with more traffic.

Summer Schedule - is this doable?
Hello, I’m currently signed up for 4 classes this summer:

CSE 140 & 140L for SS1 - Eldon, John 

Ece 111  special SS - Karna, Vishal

PHIL 162 SS2 - Stratmann, Joseph Thomas

Is this a doable schedule for this summer? I still want time to be free of school a bit this summer. Should I drop ece 111 and just do 3 classes? I could also try waitlisting a phil GE for SS2??

Any advice appreciated

Opinions on Mesa one bedroom/recommendation on grad housing?
Hi I am a new grad student with (likely) guaranteed housing.

&#x200B;

I was wondering how Central Mesa one bedrooms are like. I can see the floor plans and pictures on the HDH website, but they all seem to be of two bedrooms. Anyone got a picture/floor plan of Mesa one bedroom?

&#x200B;

It would help me a lot if you could share your experience/opinions about grad housings too. I prefer bigger/old to newer but smaller places. Would really like an AC and dishwasher, but it seems like all the grad housing units are poorly equipped in that regards...

Questions about quarter system for graduate students
I am not familiar with the quarter system and was wondering what is considered full-time for graduate students? 

From what I've read for the MS engineering program there are 36 units required, but that seems low if spread out over 2 years. Does that leave room for other classes? Is the workload from those classes enough that additional classes would be too much? Or do most people finish the program in less than 2 years?

Graduation pics rant
so I’ve been seeing a lot of photographers post their work and advertise on Facebook and everybody’s work is hella stunning but I feel super bitter deep down because I feel like part of the reason why they turn out nice is also because the students themselves are attractive. If you think I’m trying to discredit the photographers’ skills, then please don’t read any further. This post isn’t for you. 

Basically I don’t know if I should get pictures done because I feel really unattractive and unworthy of spending so much money on pics. Like why do I want to look at myself yk? I can’t even store selfies/pics in my phone. I tolerate the mirror and don’t hate what I see so I don’t think I have body dysmorphia. I just...also fear that getting my pics done will convince my fragile mind that my appearance defines my success. 

I also don’t have friends at UCSD (lost touch with them through the pandemic) so i don’t have the incentive of “do it for your friends” 

Very conflicted and seeking consolation/advice. Thank you in advance.

Suing Accelion
Sooo this is kind of a reach but would it be possible to somehow file a lawsuit against Accelion/the UC system? Or at least could we do that collectively? I’m not too educated on this topic unfortunately so I’m not exactly sure how this works, but I’ve also been affected by this breach and i’m worried- I just wish we could have some sort of compensation aside from the Experian code thing because of how big this breach is :(

Financial aid after graduating early?
If I graduate after fall 2021, will I still receive financial aid for the fall quarter? I know I obviously wouldn't for winter and spring 2022 since I won't be a student at that point, but will my financial aid for fall be the same as my usual quarterly aid or will it be reduced? Or, is there a difference in the impact of graduating early on the ucsd grant vs cal/pell grants?

Thanks in advance

Literatures in English major — Transfer Student
Hey everybody,

I’m patiently waiting for my transfer admissions decision to come back. I applied with my declared major as Literatures in English with Literature/Writing as my second choice. 

For those of you that transferred from a California CC into one of these majors, what was your GPA? I applied with a 3.63 which I feel is competitive in comparison to what I’ve seen on the posted statistics on UC’s website. I recently got accepted to UCSB, which I wasn’t expecting at all, so I feel as if my chances at UCSD are pretty good. 

How do you all like the literature/English department at UCSD? I’m not too worried about the school being STEM focused as I’ll be living off campus anyways so the people I do meet will be in my literature classes anyway. 

Thanks for the insight!

LTW L 172 Attendance?
&#x200B;

I am currently taking De Marchi for LTWL 172. I was just wondering if anyone who has taken this class before or other classes with her knows how much the lecture attendance would worth?

I am a bit stressed right now for I have missed 2 lectures already due to timezone differences. The syllabus on grade distribution is quite ambiguous, but she does say attendance is an important component in this class, so I have no idea how my grade is doing right now and how much these absences would impact it...

If anyone has any experiences with her or has any tips please reach out to me. Thanks all!

I have a class where the professor and IA do not have office hours in my biology lab class. There are only lectures and labs. The professor never mentions anything about setting an appointment with him/her/them or office hours in his/her/their syllabus, and I was wondering if that is allowed? If you know the answer to this question, then can you tell how you know, or where you found the information? If you can't, then that is fine as well. Thanks.

Ce major - upper division classes
Hello, currently I’m taking ece 45, ece 65, cse 21, poli 27. I already find classes quite difficult. Ece 35 was hardest by far with ece 45 and 65 being a little easier. CSE 21 is my final cse class and it has been pretty difficult. 

Kinda a dumb question ,but, how does the difficulty of classes increase in the upper div cse and ece courses?

Which class should I drop? / Future ECE / CSE classes
Hello everyone, it’s week 4 and I’m a little stressed out. My current schedule is ece 45, ece 65, cse 21, poli 27. I took cse 21 this quarter cuz of p/np but even with that I haven’t done shit for poli and it already feels like I’ve been doing 3 classes. I feel like I should drop poli but dropping 21 makes my life a lot easier.

I was only hesitant about dropping 21 because if I do, I will have to take it with upper div ece or cse classes in the future (can’t this summer). Do ece / cse classes only get harder from here ? Lmao 

Advice appreciated.

Looking for a full place to sublease in July or August with a parking spot!
Hi everyone, 2014 alumni here.  

Did you sign on for a 1 bedroom apartment, excited for all the on campus summer parties you were going to have, only to find yourself meeting your friends using an Oculus Rift in the world's most expensive game room?  

Are you hoping to just abandon your $30k a year Zoom/Google Meet Coursera alternative and return home where they have real BBQ and backyards, but are unsure what to do about your expensive off-campus apartment?  

Were you sharing a place with your precious BF or GF, only to find out they weren't as fun to date when you were stuck with them 24 hours a day during lockdowns, and now after breaking up when you caught them watching, and enjoying, the latest season of The Walking Dead, you're having trouble keeping up with rent costs and considering moving out but have a lease term to abide by?  

Then boy oh boy do I have the solution for you! My wife and I are planning to visit in July or August so my mother can finally meet her granddaughter. Unfortunately, for reasons I can't get into, my sister's house (where my mom is staying) is not a good option. Because we have a 8 month old (will be 11 months or so) baby, we would like to sublease the entire place. We're not a big family so even a 1 BR would do (they're huge in the US).  

The amount we can pay sort of depends on the place, but we are hoping somewhere around $1000 (give or take a couple hundred) a month. I know that's very optimistic but given how little travel there is right now, we figure that's competitive with AirBNB prices. If you know anyone that's suddenly cancelling their summer plans to stay in SD, please let them know. We are a pretty normal/safe family. I'm a software engineer for a big company in Tokyo (I WFH from Fukuoka) and my wife is a nurse taking a break from working for raising the baby. We don't do drugs (not even the "safe" one) and most of my friends in SD are working professionals.
--------------------------------------------------
Should I stay another quarter??
Please, I need some advice on what to do. I'm a transfer student and I should be graduating after this quarter. However, that means my time at UCSD was only 1 quarter and a half on campus. I want to delay my graduation for another quarter and enjoy the campus. Is this move worth it? I'd lose money and time not working, but I felt my time at UCSD was too short. Any advice is sincerely appreciated.
--------------------------------------------------
CHEM 126B Midterm cope
That was soooo different from what I expected 😓

Tbh I’d be happy just passing the class at this point since I desperately need it to graduate but even that seems unlikely after how bad it went for me. We had ample time but I was just...stumped.

Pierre Ouillet, Chief Financial Officer of UCSD, eat a full bag of shit
Update below - After the email.

\*Full email below

 The UCSD CFO has the fucking gall to tell grad students to learn how to do math after the university blew its own budget building all of 6th college, and is now raising rent by 30-85%. Are you out of your goddamn mind? Fuck Khosla, Fuck this prick, Fuck UCSD. If you just signed up to be a grad, this is what you have to look forward to. If you were aspiring to come here as a grad, look elsewhere. If you're a faculty member trawling through this sub, get this man fired. If you're Pierre Ouillet, who makes $389,375/year to shit on the graduate students who teach at this school for fuckall, choke on a hot log you fucking piece of shit!

Full email sent out by UAW:  
"Clearly you don’t know how to do math.”  


That’s what Pierre Ouillet, Chief Financial Officer of UCSD, said today to me in a meeting between residents of UCSD housing and Chancellor Khosla where we presented our case to the Chancellor and his staff that rent hikes of up to 85% for new residents are completely unreasonable. But as Graduate Student Researchers in the natural sciences, it turns out that we do math quite well, certainly well enough to know that graduate students cannot afford to pay $1,365 (up from $873) on a $2,500 monthly income, as the next resident of my room will be asked to do.

UCSD’s main justification for increasing rents so greatly is that housing must be “self-supporting,” and HDH’s only source of income are rents. As we pointed out in today’s meeting, that simply isn’t true: [UCOP’s Rule 72](https://studentresearchersunited.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a5106e05940cfb3c7e234dac4&id=00fb13e7e4&e=8e9bf53b1e) on auxiliary services such as campus housing explicitly states that, “Chancellors may subsidize auxiliary enterprises with appropriate available campus funds.” Clearly, Khosla has the power to balance the budget without putting it on the backs of graduate tenants.

Here’s what we said: 

* Rents must be frozen, not increased, during this historic pandemic.
* HDH must stop pushing degrading double occupancy as a solution to our rent burden.
* The University has the money to make graduate housing affordable, but instead administrators are once again making the choice to shift the cost onto underpaid workers.

Ouillet went on to say to us, “by the time you leave grad school, maybe you’ll learn how to balance a budget.” To that we said, we balance our budgets every month! That’s why we’re fighting these rent increases. We already have to choose each month between paying our rent and other life necessities.

Khosla committed to continuing to dialogue and look further into the points we made. Residents have their attention now, but it's clear that UCSD administration won’t budge unless we continue to hold them accountable.

Forming a union for Student Researchers is one powerful way to give graduate employees at UC more power to fight for affordable housing and fair wages, because with a union UC must negotiate a contract with us collectively. Housing is a workplace issue, especially while so many of us continue to work from home. Khosla is slow listen, but with an SR union he will have no choice. Please ask your friends and labmates to [sign a union authorization card ](https://studentresearchersunited.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a5106e05940cfb3c7e234dac4&id=8d945cb1cd&e=8e9bf53b1e)if they haven’t already. 

And if you’re a resident of graduate housing, you can get involved in the movement to freeze the rent by reaching out to this [email address](mailto:freezetherentucsd@gmail.com), and attend the socially-distanced rally this Sunday April 25th at noon outside Mesa Nueva.   
 

 
 

P.S. - here’s a link to the SRU-UAW [union authorization card](https://studentresearchersunited.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a5106e05940cfb3c7e234dac4&id=866cb62460&e=8e9bf53b1e).


Update - A staff (not admin) member reached out privately and wanted to share the following:

“Hey i just saw your post about pierre ouillet. I don't feel comfortable actually commenting this but I'm staff in a department on campus and he's said so much insensitive shit to us too.

Like we switched the payroll whatever from ayso to ucpath last year and it's been a fucking shitshow and during a town hall for us to make suggestions and ask questions he said "well maybe you all need to hire more competent staff"

This was after he made a decision that made our jobs harder. He's one of few people i actively hope gets flesh eating bacteria.”

I'm tired
My first midterm came back a 28%. I don't know what the curve will give me. I feel so tired. This place is so draining. It's always one thing after another. No break. No relaxation. No friends to be with. This place is sucking the life out of me. The classes. The people. The very buildings themselves. It all seems to tire me out.

I have another school year left in this place, but I don't think I can take it anymore. I was burnt out when I came here, but now I'm just slowly destroying myself mentally. Like a machine that's on its last legs, but now all the continued work is just destroying it. I can't take it anymore. This place is a vampire, sucking the life out of me. I hate Econ, I take no joy for it. I feel stuck.

I'm so tired. I just want to rest. I can't take this anymore. I can't take this place anymore. Everyday feels so dreadful.

I keep trying my best, but my best is never good enough.

Remote Learning 2021 Fall
What are the chances UCSD will be offering remote learning this upcoming fall 2021? I know we will most likely be returning to campus this fall but do you guys think that they will still offer remote learning?. I will be going into my 4th year and at this point it doesn't make sense to me to go through the process of moving back to SD.

Units for freshman year
I wanted to drop a class before the deadline tmrw bc I failed the first quiz and I don’t even need the class, but if I drop then my total units for freshman year would be 32 and I think you need 36 to continue receiving financial aid right? Does that mean just UCSD financial aid or fafsa too? Is there any way around that bc I really don’t wanna keep taking that class esp if I don’t need it

Hi
I’m not a UCSD student, I’m actually a junior at Cal Poly SLO! I’m from San Diego and joined this page just to laugh at San Diego college student memes. I just wanted to say this page has provided me with lots of entertainment despite not being a student at this institution. The memes, posts about feeling burnt out, sense of not feeling alone, etc. Cal polys student reddit page simply does not compare in this sense. Okay bye (from a fellow zoom university burnt out quarter system student)

Possible UCI Medical Center Scam UC Data Breach
I just received a phone call from someone claiming to work for UCI Medical Center. To make a long story short, they claimed someone visited the hospital with my name, dob, school email, and phone number. 

I never use my UCSD email outside of anything school related  so right away I knew something was up. So either someone is using my identity to get their med bills paid, or the caller got my info from the data breach and was trying to get my financial info(when I reverse searched the number nothing related to UCI Med Center came up). 

Regardless, be careful out there ya'll! Don't answer any unfamiliar numbers, and if you haven't yet signed up for the free year of Experian please do so right away!

When to look for off campus housing?
Hey everyone,

I am going to be a grad student at the school starting this fall. I will be moving with my gf to San Diego and I was wondering when I should start looking for places to stay. Looking for a 1Bed 1 Bath.

Also how hard is it to find an apartment for pets, we have 2 cats that are both ESA certified. 

Thanks!

Construction Noise next to Revelle
I've been stopping myself from saying anything about this because it seems like there's nothing that can be done, but at this point I don't know what else to do. I live in Keeling Apartments and every single day is like waking up with a headache because the construction is SO. LOUD. I understand that they need to work to actually make progress (duh) but I really don't see why they can't start later in the morning. It has been affecting all of my roommates as well and I'm curious to know if it bothers other Keeling residents. It's just this non-stop pounding that is incredibly loud with windows closed and even louder if windows are open.

I basically wanted to ask if anyone knew if there is **anything** that can be done about the noise because I am at the end of my rope. Thank you!

Withdrawing from School
Im having a suer hard time in school right now. I really don't have any motivation left to continue this quarter. I've had family move in with us into our 2 bedroom apartment because they're looking to rent a place. I have no quiet space to study. Its literally 8 of us in our apartment right now. I receive financial aid from school so I don't know if withdrawing is even an option at this point, but I feel like if I continue I'll definitely be failing my classes. Anybody gone through something similar or have any advice?

I've Been Affected Too by the Data Breach
Hey Y'all,

After signing up for Experian, I too received the email that my personal information was found on the dark web. And I know I am not the only one. Something needs to be done because now so many of us are susceptible to identity theft.  


Besides freezing our credit, what else can we do? Obviously, criminals on the dark web can use our information in other ways than just trying to open credit lines, you know?
--------------------------------------------------
Help! How do I orchestrate my graduation?
I live \~500 miles away from SD in Norcal. I want to attend graduation in-person.

I didn't get the vaccine yet, but I heard that I need a COVID test 1 week before graduation in order to participate. Also, if I **did** get vaccinated, I would be experiencing side effects, which would pretty much ruin the quarter and my academic performance. Also, I need two shots \~3 weeks apart, so idk if I have the time for it. The final nail on the coffin is appointments. God it'd be a miracle if I could even get the shot.

Another complication is that I have a final the day before graduation (fucking perfect, right?), and the syllabus says it can't be rescheduled :/

Driving down takes us about 9-10 hours. I honestly don't know if flying is safe; I don't want to disclose any details, but we have someone at home who's high risk, and I absolutely don't want any harm coming their way.

I don't want to stay in a hotel room out of COVID fear. Was thinking of driving down on the day of graduation, and immediately driving back the same day. Might be exhausting, but my dad and I can take turns at the wheel.

Any thoughts? I'm just so exhausted...

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks for the advice! I think we're gonna go ahead with a pfizer/moderna dose 1 at the minimum, and look into hotel rooms for the night. Yeah rushing it might ruin the graduation vibe, ty all so much!

Credit monitoring is largely useless, you should freeze your credit instead
Feel free to sign up for the year of credit monitoring that was offered after the data breach, however don’t expect much from it. On top of that, if you are thinking about paying for it indefinitely for the rest of your life, I would urge you to reconsider, especially from a company as shitty as Experian.

Unfortunately, credit monitoring is largely useless. The best thing you can do is freeze your credit at each of the three major institutions. It’s free to freeze / unfreeze as many times as you want (useful for when you need to unfreeze in order to open a new line of credit, like a credit card).

Each site makes it a little tricky to find the freeze option (and they all try to sell you on their own credit monitoring services along the way), but they are legally required to offer unlimited freezes / unfreezes for free nowadays.

The process is simple and can be done entirely online. There are plenty of guides that’ll walk you through it, but the basic gist is that you’ll create an account at each of the Experian / Equifax / TransUnion websites, and then when you enable the freeze you’ll be given a PIN to use when you want to unfreeze it. You’ll only be shown this PIN once so you’ll want to store it somewhere safe that you’ll remember.

The next time you need to unfreeze your credit, you’ll have the option to do so for an indefinite amount of time, or you can set a temporary lift for a day or two while someone does a credit check. The lift happens instantly, so it won’t slow you down when you need it.

If you lose the PIN, you’ll have to call in and go through the hassle of verifying your identity, although honestly I wish it was more of a hassle because I went through that process with TransUnion and it was too easy IMO.

All of the credit monitoring companies are terrible, but freezing is your best bet to avoid identity fraud. Ultimately, if someone really, really wanted to steal your identity, they would be able to. The idea is to make it difficult enough that the bad actor moves on to a lower hanging, less protected fruit, rather than waste their time trying to get around a credit freeze.
--------------------------------------------------
Is there anyway for me to take 10 units this quarter without being part time?
I’m currently in ece 35 and honestly it’s a complete mess. Some of the homework solutions completely contradict what the textbook states and nothing is making sense I can’t handle this. I really want to drop it because I don’t think I can pass even when P/NP, if I drop it Ill be below 12 units. Can I petition it to not be part time?

need to vent
I got super sick at the beginning of the week and i was slated to fly back to california this saturday. I had a ochem midterm on tuesday, my professors have been kind enough to give me some extension of 24ish hours but no illness fully goes away that fast (For me). Anyways, i somehow got through the quizzes and exams and everything and now i  found out i have covid. I have been properly in lockdown since last march. Havent met any of my close friends since early feb and basically just focused on schoolwork and keeping myself mentally healthy. After this week, i'm really tired. I can't go back to california yet, yet again cancelling my flight for the 3rd time since spring break. I'm grateful i dont have any of the severe symptoms as compared to how i was barely able to get out of bed earlier this week but im at a loss. idk what to do next. I know people have it way worse than me, but i cant help but wallow as i sit in isolation.   
im sorry if this has a bunch of english errors, its hard to see through blurry eyes.

Need Help!!!
So this is what happened to me, what could I do? Did anyone ever encounter with similar issues like mine? I am so stressed out...

Hi there, 

My case is kind of complex. I planned to graduate after Spring 2021. At first, I saw that both graduation criterias, Disciplinary Focus Required Economics Course & Disciplinary Focus, required ECON 101 at the same time, so I assumed that taking that one class could fulfill both criterias at the same time, too. However, before I decided to submit the application for DDA earlier around this Feb or March, I double checked with a couple counselors including a counselor for my major and a counselor for my college, Six College, to see if I was actually eligible to graduate. They both helped me go through my audit and at that time, no one told me anything about the fact that ECON 101 could only fulfill one of the criterias mentioned above. One of them literally told me "everything looks good on your audit and you can go ahead and apply" for the graduation. Until today, I received this Email saying I am not qualified to graduate, I was extremely confused and found out that it is this tricky ECON 101 criteria that messed up everything of my plan. I even applied for RCL and part time study because I always thought I would just need that last one class (INTL 190) in order to graduate. No one, ever, tried to correct me although I literally told them I planned to graduate this Spring at the beginning of every Zoom Virtual Couseling. I am an international student and my student VISA is about to expire in mid June, so this is extremely urgent to me. This could be an extremely expensive error for me. I really hope you guys could kindly figure something out for me. You could argue that I was being too stupid to understand the school's audit system, but this is not completely my fault. No one, ever, tried to correct me and they went through my audit with me, without noticing the problem. I apologize in advance if any of my words above sound a bit harsh. I truly believe the consequence of such miscommunication could be fixed by you guys and UCSD, as a school full of academic awards and achievements, is able to give me a fair answer.

To everybody worried about the data breach
I’m seeing a lot of posts that people have gotten security alerts from experian so in case y’all don’t know: place a fraud alert on your account through experian. It doesn’t affect your credit or anything it just makes it so that if anybody tries to use your SSN to get a credit card or something the company will be notified to more thoroughly verify that it’s you. Stay safe friends!

Off Campus Housing
So, I am trying to find housing for Fall 2021. I am considering finding my own place but I am also wondering if there are any people who are interested in sharing a place as well. Whether that would be me moving in with someone or someone moves in with me is up for discussion. But, given the world as it is with internet insecurities, is there a private community or some sort of messaging group for these types of scenarios? It would be helpful if there was some sort of tool to help me.  


Edit: I am a guy so if you identify as a female, please do not consider joining with me.

I have 7 W's on my transcript. Would it be impossible for me to transfer to UCSD computer engineering?
I have dropped all classes this semester and I am considering moving to another California community college and start anew. I was taking classes from the other side of the Pacific and I had to wake up at 2:00 am and take classes until 9:00 am. This kind of lifestyle had a serious toll on my health(I had been diagnosed with manic depression 3 years ago...)  and I dropped all classes impulsively even though I have been maintaining good grades.... 

Do you think I can transfer to UCSD computer engineering major in the CSE department if I start anew at a different community college in California and get over 3.8 gpa or should I look for other States where W's wouldn't be of a big deal(like Maryland)?

Anyone else doing the commencement ceremony without any friends?
I’m in Marshall and all of my friends are either not graduating or not attending. I still want to participate in the ceremony cuz it’s a huge accomplishment, but I don’t want to feel awkward or alone because I don’t have anyone to wait/sit with.

in languishing rn
\^ seems like a common sentiment amongst my friends & I rn - an interesting read if you have a moment: [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/well/mind/covid-mental-health-languishing.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/well/mind/covid-mental-health-languishing.html)

Commencement Picture Upload
When applying for commencement, I got to the step where you have to upload a photo of yourself. I was wondering where exactly the photo is used and how important it is to look nice in it. Is it normally like the photo we chose for our ID card, more natural than that, or?

Should I sign up for Experian?
Just checking tbh I will probably sign up for Experian anyway now, but should I sign up for experian?

My main thing against it is literally giving yet another group my personal info, bruh I swear if experian leak my private info too.

Also for everyone talking about how they were notified through email when their info was leaked, was it **UCSD that sent the email, or Experian?** Trying to figure out for people lagging on signing up if they would have at least been notified by UCSD (after initial email announcement) because if not, some SSN leaks would've slip through the cracks without notifications.

What happens if I drop down to 8 units?
I recently got a job at a lab and two of the classes I'm taking this quarter are pretty important classes for my major, and a lot of work. I'm thinking of dropping the third class I'm in, which is just a writing GE, so I can handle everything else better. I've heard stuff about having to stay over 12 units for financial aid and stuff, but I'm not receiving any financial aid, so I don't have to worry about that. Is there anything else I'd have to watch out for if I drop down to 8 units?

The Breach - Some Advice on Handling it
Hey, everyone! I wanted to take a second to give some steps about what to do as a result of the data breach, because I see a lot of people asking questions about it, so in no particular order, here are some good steps:

&#x200B;

\- If you have not already, sign up for Equifax or Experian, LOCK YOUR CREDIT, and set a fraud alert. Even outside of the breach, your credit should always be locked unless you want to use it.

\- Ensure your credit card doesn't have any weird use (my AmEx lets me see in the app, and I run my card with my bank thru Google Pay so I get notified whenever a purchase is made).

\- If you see any strange activity in any bank account, get on top of it immediately. 

Semi-unrelated to those points, here are some general banking/credit tips, cause a lot of college students lack any real education on this stuff:

\- Having a credit card is a GOOD THING. You want/need to be building credit right now. It can be a bad thing if you open too many at once, or fail to pay them off on time. But opening a credit card now, will help you get an apartment, or a car, without your parents needing to cosign with you. 

\- If you do not have a debit card/checking or savings account... You need to get one. We are all 18+, you need a bank account of your own, most employers will do things through direct deposit, and it is much better to manage your own money.

Anyone else feel its inappropriate to send blatant inflammatory political misinformation to UCSD distro lists? I'm trying to get an engineering degree here...

For math-cs students/grads, what's been your luck finding software engineering internships?
I feel like I've asked so many questions about math-cs on here so i'm sorry :(

So I'm a CC transfer applicant who applied as math-cs as their first choice. I know this program is not a CS program nor is it a replacement for one. I applied to it because while I applied to other UCs as CS, math is my favorite subject and I saw that you still take CS courses as part of the curriculum. So this program seems to be the right fit for me. My dad, however, is not very happy with this program being my first choice as he thinks that it will be difficult to obtain a job and/or internships related to software engineering or programming. I would like to complete at least one SE/programming internship during my time in undergrad. I was under the impression that your degree doesn't matter too much for these sorts of job,  and your skills are the most important. So any input from math-cs students/graduates would be appreciated.  


TL;DR Dad thinks if I enter UCSD's math-cs program that I won't be able to find internships or a job in software engineering or programming after graduating. Would like to hear from math-cs students/grads on their experience finding software engineering internships?

ECE 15 Help

Any ideas on a LEGAL & HARMLESS senior prank?
If you’re open to sharing, what were some of your high school senior pranks?

And do you have any ideas for senior pranks to play this year?

This year has not been easy for anyone, especially seniors. Let’s get some lighthearted jokes going before we graduate!

I am down to collab on a senior prank IF the prank idea is legal && harmless.

You can comment your ideas and feel free to DM me!

Is it okay for Professor to do something that was not included in Syllabus?
Just took my "midterm/quiz" today, was caught by surprise. We had to do lockdown browser, that was not mentioned in syllabus, was not mentioned at all during lectures or sections. I started the exam, didn't know anything, spent 5 mins just to download the lockdown. I felt like it should be said or warned prior to the test. Are professors even allowed to catch people by surprised like that? I think it's just unfair and uncalled for.

don’t know if I should drop a class/rant
So I’ve been feeling very out of it and have been barely keeping up with school. This is my first year in college and this whole online thing I guess isn’t helping out. I feel so unmotivated and I get sudden feelings of wanting to get work done but it quickly goes away. I’ve already missed two quizzes for one class (one quiz gets dropped), I didn’t intend to miss them I just thought the second quiz was due today at 11:59 pm but turns out it was due at 12 pm today. It’s purely my fault for being unorganized but now I don’t know if I should just drop this class and be left with 12 units. If I do, will this affect my financial aid? I’m also falling behind in all my classes and don’t keep up with lectures. I feel dumb to say the least. Any advice? :(
--------------------------------------------------
If you haven't, you should really sign up for the Experian monitoring we get for free because of the data breach.

Anyone else just feeling out of it
Everyday feels painfully the same with lectures, homework, and other tasks to do. I'd wake up, literally breathe several times and it would be night already. I'll be graduating after this quarter but my mood isn't as celebratory as it should be? I'm glad that I'll be graduating soon, but it's more of a relief that I'll finally get out of here instead of being genuinely excited. What's odd is that I've been regularly exercising and seeing my therapist weekly but I still feel tired and lukewarm. If anyone wants to share if they are feeling similar or found ways to feel better, that'd be great.

\*\*edit\*\*

Thank you all for sharing; it's nice and comforting to read people showing support and sharing similar experiences. Best of luck to everyone to finish this quarter strong!!

Campus no-guest policy
Hello! I just moved in to campus 2 days ago and  need to move a lot of things that’s basically impossible to be carried all by myself. I could get a friend to help me, but am concerned about violating the no-guest policy for that. 

How did everyone else get around moving? Would it be okay if my friend just helped me move boxes into my apartment, and doesn’t stay inside for any more than just that?

Can I switch math sequences ????
Basically, first year student, currently taking 20C. It’s rly hard lol I finished 20B and got credits for 20A. I only need up to C for my major, but I was wondering if I could enroll into 10C instead and still count as completed math for my major

Mandatory Discussion
I am an international student and one of my classes has mandatory discussions once or twice a week (according to Webreg there should only be one discussion). Part of the total grades is based on the discussion participation (only 4% which is like it will affect your letter grade but you still cannot get many easy points). There are no alternative times or ways to make up for absence. Since I have other things going on, the discussion time for me basically means I can only have 3-4 hour sleep on that day. I am wondering if what the professor is doing is legit and if there is anything I can do. My friend who took class with the same professor says he is never willing to make any accommodations for students, and since the class size is small I don't want to expose my personal information to him while doing something that potentially makes him unhappy.

Transfer from UCSC CS to UCSD CS
I am attending UCSC as a Freshman majoring in CS. I want to transfer from UCSC to UCSD preferably after my second year at UCSC. Is it possible to transfer to UCI? Would love to hear from people that have done UC to UC CS transfer before.

Even thinking about dropping out of UCSC and going to CC for a year but I don't know if it's too late since I've already completed 3 quarters at UCSC.

MCAT Courses + Advice
Hi everyone,

I am finishing up my third year and I’m planning on dedicating this summer to studying for the MCAT. For those who have taken the MCAT, what courses did you guys take (if any) and which ones would you recommend? 

Also, are courses only available for certain dates or can you self study with a course? My family is thinking about traveling back to our hometown for about a week so I’m trying  to see if this is doable.

Any help/advice would be appreciated!

Isn't the ML/AI department in UCSD one of the best in the world?
According to [csrankings.org](https://crankings.org/), ucsd is top 10 for ML/AI and during 2020-2021 UCSD has ranked in 6th for ML/AI according to this page [http://csrankings.org/#/fromyear/2020/toyear/2021/index?ai&vision&mlmining&nlp&ir&us](http://csrankings.org/#/fromyear/2020/toyear/2021/index?ai&vision&mlmining&nlp&ir&us)

Aren't there a lot of opportunities for undergrad majoring in cs to participate in research in ML/AI in UCSD considering it is one of the top institutes for ML/AI?

Housing Contract Cancellation

I already emailed HDH but haven't got a response back yet. If you have canceled your contract last quarter or this quarter did you get a refund? Thank you to those who answer :)

I failed ECE15 during fall 2020 (thought I dropped it, that ended up not being the case) and I’m retaking it now but I fell behind. I can still drop by the Friday deadline and just retake it another time during my undergrad and the F would be replaced right? Or is that not the case. Thanks!

UCSD doubling up on Triton2Go charges?
I felt like my dining dollars were dipping a bit faster than they should, so I checked out tritoncash and it has a completely separate section for getting/returning the containers, which is fine. Barrage of +5, -5, and everything checks out.

But they also charge 5 dollars on your original order straight from dining dollars, and no money ever goes back into that account. Am I missing something, insane, or are we being gipped out of 5 bucks every time we grab a to go container?

The Data Breach is Serious
So I’ve had info leaked in tons of breaches before, but just changed passwords and set up 2FA on everything because idc if somebody steals my random forum password. But the UCSD breach really freaked me out because they have access to everything they need to completely ruin your life. I signed up for the free Experian monitor instantly. 

Just about 30 minutes ago, I received a notification from Experian that my SSN was found online and that it was linked to the UCSD breach. It wasn’t just my SSN disconnected from anything else, they also have my full name, date of birth and address. I promptly put a freeze on my credit with all 3 companies. 

If you were sleeping on this hoping it was no big deal, please take the time to make sure your life isn’t going to be destroyed out of some corporation’s complacency. Other people in my cohort have told me they were compromised too and chances are many of you were as well.

Edit: typo

Transfer decisions 2021
I’ve seen conspiracies that transfer decisions come out this Friday (23rd), whilst others have said potentially Thursday due to UCB coming out on Friday and they usually come out before UCB. But then on their Instagram when somebody asked if they’re coming this week, they responded “transfer decisions will be released at the end of April”. 

It is so agonizing not having a confirmed date for UCSD. Anyone else relating to this or have any ideas as to when it’ll be??

Declaration of Major
I had a question regarding the declaration of my desired major in Thurgood Marshall college.

I've been interested in Computer Science for a long time, and have wanted to pursue it in university. I've maintained a high GPA in Computer Science in high school. 

Thanks in advance :)

I saw past posts saying it was difficult to find therapists and I'm not sure if that was a unique experience to those individuals or a common thing ://

Racism in my childhood and how UCSD helped me reflect on it.
I come from (obviously) a minority, and deeply religious family. I came to the US when I was two. In light of everything going on in the country with the violence against Sikhs, Asians, blacks, I felt a strong compulsion to share my experiences, so here we go.

My parents forced me to attend K-12 at a private, Christian school in a Republican enclave in Southern California. This school was culturally white, culturally racist, and culturally Republican. It was very small, our graduating class was about 40, everyone was forced to know everyone else intimately. The white students went out of their way to make any minority's life a living hell. I will now share the most impactful experiences I still remember.

• My name was deliberately mispronounced all throughout elementary. In 2nd or 3rd grade it got so had the teacher had to make an announcement on the correct pronunciation. I remember wanting to change it as a child because of all the grief it caused. I'd never change it now, at 20.

• In 7th grade, there was a phenomenon of "Yo Mama" jokes. I was somewhat of a loner in elementary but I started climbing the social pyramid quite rapidly thereafter. I amassed a lot of popular friends, and took on that distinction myself eventually. I vividly remember being annoyed with constant mocking 7/11 jokes in an Apu-like Indian accent in the vein of: “Hello, this is [my name], welcome to 7/11.” Just horrible stuff like that day after day that wore me down mentally. Idiotic racist trolling questions and the like. Also in this time period, my mother was almost dying from kidney failure so all these things combined weren't great.

Amidst all of this, I remember wanting to participate in the "Yo Mama" jokes, as any 7th grader wants to feel included. However, I became increasingly fed up with the racial animus and I told one of my "friends", let's call him C, to stop and tell others to stop them as well. He said, "well, you can't be in our group then." I was so enamored with the prospect of popularity and social standing that I threw away my dignity and allowed myself to effectively be minstrelised with the acceptance of these remarks to be socially accepted. This is one of the most disgusting things looking back.

• In 8th grade, we were outside doing some school event, and a redneck student made fun of my father for working at the job he did, which was considered "low class" to the privileged lives everyone else at the school led (we were on a need based scholarship). I very much regret not responding to this with furor at the time and instead responding jokingly. I can't believe I let someone make fun of how my father struggled day in and out to provide for my mom and I. I hold great animosity towards this person.

• In 7th grade, a very unpopular Asian student said something to one of the most obnoxious, racist white kids in the cohort that caused the white kid to think I slighted the Asian kid, which was later said to be a misunderstanding. Wanting to be the white savior, this wizard in flowing robe confronted me outside of class with this beautiful statement: "Why are you messing with [the Asian kid]? At least his people are doctors and lawyers. You people just run motels." This was an infuriating acrid statement. Again, I strongly regret not doing anything to this vile buffoon, whose parents were deeply embedded in the school's administration. This is one of the things I hated the most about the school's culture. It pitted minority against minority. Be racist to everyone except whites or you won't survive. I blocked this idiot on all social media recently as just seeing his face inspires much consternation.

• One of my "friend"’s siblings literally saying that I was bad/shouldn't be associated with because of my ethnicity.

• A teacher in a photography class defending the use of the confederate flag while some of the class agreed and me and one other student vocally disagreed. Another student brings up the notion that the n-word is acceptable to use, and the teacher entertains this notion and doesn't refute it whatsoever. Needless to say Bible class was a constant stream of "gay and trans people will be crucified in hell."

In 9th-12th grade, I rose to the top of the social hierarchy and had more leeway to shut shit down if it sprung up. C from earlier would have very suspect behavior every now and then and I would immediately call him out on it. Life was pretty good for most of high school, however these events would replay in my mind every so often. I never told my parents about any of this as they were already going through much with my mom's health issues.

• But hey, I got into a top 20 (top 10 for my major actually) on a full ride! This was unfathomable being from an extremely low-income minority family. My parents always pushed me to get into a prestigious college but we realistically had no idea how to pay for it. Getting into UCSD was one of the best days of my life. It was the best college anyone at my school got in to, and there was quite a bit of passive aggressive behavior from (white) students in light of my admission and when I received the exemplary scholarship award they gave out at graduation to go towards college expenses (I just got the money directly because of my full ride). Fuck y'all. Guess you didn't "work hard enough." One of the most infuriating things was how entitled these people were. One hardcore Trumper girl who got a BMW for her 16th birthday cried because she didn't get into the college she wanted that her parents had donated to. Sorry, no sympathy there. 

I just *hate* mediocrity. People with so much privilege and so many resources that I could only dream of, and then don't do anything to positively change society and just ride off of generational wealth, while complaining about how minorities are ruining the country. Needless to say, I do **not** have a positive view of my school in retrospect.

UCSD has been an amazing three years for me so far (well, 1.6 where I was actually on campus) and it's been SO liberating to be in a diverse community where you can have an intelligent conversation at a high level with anyone and talk about this. I reached out to other POC from my high school in my second year of college and we had extremely refreshing conversations and laughed at the outcomes of some people from our high school. Most shockingly, C reached out and wanted to have a discussion about racism. I basically wrote this post (but perhaps nicer directly talking to him) and he profusely apologized for his actions and felt very embarrassed looking back. He also apologized for his microaggressions later in high school and said at the time he didn't understand why I was against them but as he matured as a person he understood those actions were stemming from a place of personal insecurity and the racist culture perpetuated by the school etc. We have a great relationship now and talk regularly.

During the last summer, I also told my parents about this. My mother burst into tears and my father was quite solemn for a day or two. They couldn't believe I'd gone through this and didn't tell them anything yet were also reverent of my ability to persevere through it all.

Financial aid credit
So one of my appeals was approved and I ended up getting the Pell Grant. However I never received anything and I contacted the FAO and they said that it will pay out to my student account. So now I have a credit balance of the grant, but how do I use this money? Will I not be receiving the money directly?

Bicd 110 w Forbes (Cell Bio)
im really struggling with this course and it doesn't help that her lectures are as dry as California or that her grading scale is only midterm + final . Does anyone who's taken this course with her (preferably online) have any tips on how to prepare for her exams / or on the structure of the exam?

What did you do to get into UCSD?
UCSD is my dream college. How hard did you work to get into UCSD? What was your GPA? How many AP classes did you take? Did you have to be more talented than the others? Thank you. I graduate in 2025.

Does HDH give you a heads up for Fix-It requests?
Living on campus, just submitted a request to HDH for a busted light in my room. Got a confirmation email that basically amounts to "we'll get there when we get there lol". Anyone know if they'll contact you before they come in? This school is already enough to deal with without HDH busting down my door at 8AM lmao

COGS 14A Summer Session 1
Hi all, I'm waitlist position 28 for this summer session 14A and I'm really wondering how screwed I am, especially since I need to get this course done at some point this summer to graduate on time. Does anyone know if they might open up a new section/class or am I just actually fucked?

Edit: GET HYPE FOLKS. BOTH SECTIONS EXPANDED TO 75 CAPACITY. FUCK YEAH!
--------------------------------------------------
I dropped down to 8 units but the deadline to be part-time was last week. Am I screwed?
So basically I was enrolled in 12 units but one of the classes was kicking my ass so I decided to drop it... not realizing this will make me a part-time student. Will I be penalized for staying at 8 units? Should I try to add another class right away?
--------------------------------------------------
Dropping from full time to part time during week 4
Does anyone know if I will have to pay back anything to the FA office since my tuition was paid for if I drop to 8 Units (was previously full time) during week 4 (aka after week 2 part time deadline).
--------------------------------------------------
Commuting Help
Hey, guys!

Over the summer I'm looking to get a place, and have hit a bit of a predicament. The office of the company I work at is all the way up in 4S Ranch, and ofc UCSD is in La Jolla, and I do not have a car. I could get the place in La Jolla, but then have a 2ish hour commute on bus to the office, or I have been looking at a middleground in Mira Mesa (ish) for cheaper rent, but still run into extreme bus commute times. 

Anyone got any suggestions, besides a car? I can't really afford that right now... I am considering an electric bike, but IDK if that is a good idea or not.

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance!

Summer class workload
I was planning on taking some courses over summer and I was wondering about the workload. Is taking two classes going to be very busy? Since the length is half would the workload be about the same as 4 classes? The classes I would be interested taking are Poli 27/28 (WCWP gen. ed) and Math18. For anyone who has taken these classes, how is the workload?
--------------------------------------------------
When's the deadline to ACCEPT fafsa loans?
I couldn't find the answer anywhere. The most I've heard is 3 weeks before school starts.

Also this is for grad school, not undergrad.
--------------------------------------------------
Has anything come of the UC-wide hack?
I feel like everyone collectively forgot potentially every student (myself included) and faculty got their personal information leaked, including some financial details? Has anything been said or done by UCSD to address this?

Anyone on/near campus drive a manual and willing to teach?
Hi all, I just bought a manual car that’s still getting shipped here, but I’ve never driven a manual car so I’d like to get some experience before picking it up and driving it to campus hahah. I know how it works from experience with motorcycles but I’ve never actually done it with a car so I mainly just want some practice. 
Of course I’m willing to pay, maybe like $40 for a session? Also open to discussing how I should pay. 
If you’re willing you can dm me or just respond, thanks!

Bio and BioE Course Overlap for Premed Prereqs
Hello! 

I am a premed bioengineering student, and I'm making a detailed plan of my courses for the next few years to fulfill the prereqs for med school. Because I'm a bioengineering major, I'm trying not to take too many duplicate courses in the biology department if I can help it. I was wondering if anyone had a bit of insight on the differences between certain courses (how similar is the content, MCAT prep, level of difficulty, preferences?). 

BIMM 100 vs. BENG 102

BIPN 100/102 vs. BENG 140A/B – I have to take the Beng courses, but they say not intended for premed in the catalog

BIBC 100/102/Chem 114A/B

Anything helps, and thank you in advance!

I was racially targeted at Hillcrest by a group of white people with a stun gun
Hey y’all!

Wanna preface by saying I’m not even from here haha. I came down to visit a friend who is doing grad work here. 

Two nights ago, I went out of a Restaraunt with my partner and friend at a Restaraunt called Rakitori. As we left a group of UCSD kids were waiting for a bus, 4 white guys and two white girls. 

As we left one of them pulled out a taser and asked if I had ever been tased before. He called me the generic, boring slurs and I told him to go fuck himself. Things escalated but it never got to a place where I was attacked. They threw racial slurs and blamed me for Pearl Harbor? (Fucking weird) talked a big talk about kicking my ass but probably felt emboldened by the drinks and having a large group of people. 

Unfortunately, a lot of my experience (my very little experience here in SD) has been disappointing. Idk what my goal is writing this message but overall I just wanna say I’m disappointed. 

I’m disappointed that I know they were all friends, chopping it up and talking about plans before they saw me. And when it all happened they all sank into silence because of idk... fear? This is how complacency is so easily linked to violence. 

The two girls in that group immediately crossed the street and left. Did not record, did not call the situation out, nothing. This group of guys had the nerve after to run to me and apologize for his behavior, but stood there backing him up and helping embolden his actions. I kept thinking how insecure someone must be to come at one unarmed person with a large group and a stun gun, and how these conditions made this guy feel so validated to share his shitty opinions and calls to violence. 

I know it’s hard in the moment to assess things and to stand up and be against something in a dangerous situation. My partner thinks I made the wrong call standing up for myself and putting us all in danger so I know how difficult it can be to make the “right call”. 

Anyway, I won’t lump everyone in but I can’t help but say I’m disappointed in the culture here, in the passivity and apathy that I’ve seen. I think it’s really easy to say you’re against things like racism and violence, but in that situation for me, for my friend and partner... I know these are the dudes who think they are exempt from racial dialogues. 

Also, not blaming UCSD at all, overall San Diego seems to be filled with obnoxious, narcissistic types that are entitled. We weren’t in some alley btw, ppl saw what was happening, they couldn’t be bothered I guess

No clue what kinda dialogue will come from this but I had to let it out somewhere that felt right I guess. Sorry if it’s a lengthy read!
--------------------------------------------------
When do you think school will go back to normal?
When school reopens, I will not be at UCSD. I am a graduating senior going off to law school, and I will be gone at that point, but UCSD is a school full of smart biologists and researchers, so I feel like you people should have a great answer for this.

I think every adult I have spoken to about this (pretty much every adult I know) has had at least one dose of either Pfizer or Moderna. I know vaccine rollout is different from county to county, but I think we can all agree it’s happening.

From my limited understanding, enough people are on track to getting the vaccine, and when enough people get it, that’s when it will be safe to go back to our normal ways. You never know for certain with new strains and all what might happen.

**When do you think school will re-open in Fall 2019 fashion?**

Here’s what I mean by “Fall 2019 fashion.” Classes were held in person, professors could require attendance if they wanted to, the number of seats in the lecture hall was the number of people who could attend class (including some folks who might not have even been enrolled), finals were held in person, and masks were not required.

In finals week, the first two floors of Geisel would be packed and they’d come around scanning your ID to make sure you were a real student.

2019 was a magical time, so long ago, and I barely remember what that time even felt like. When can we go back to those ways?
--------------------------------------------------
How does the whole course selection process work?
Can you see which professors teach which courses? Also, I know the grading system is up to each professor, but what does that look like for most classes? A curve?

Final question, how is GPA calculated, are all classes weighed the same?

200+$ for Graduation gown is disrespectful
I felt ashamed, embarrassed and ridiculed when the commencement registration led me to this silly page selling graduation stuff for horrendously exorbitant price. Like look at this…[graduation gown](https://ucsandiegobookstore.com/t-gradpacks.aspx) it looks like i just came out of a theme park ride, and now i have to go through the last room where they sell all their souvenirs. 
If UCSD had any respect for their student then they should at least give the graduation gowns for free, you know how a token of achievement should be. We earned those gowns, we earned our education in 4 stressful years trying to run as fast as we can. But this stupid bookstore page tells us that none of that was true or meaningful. We bought our degree. Our efforts dont earn respect, money does. The university doesnt want to create good citizens, it wants money, like a f*cking theme park ride. 
So, being in the graduating class is going to feel like going to harry potter world and begging daddy to buy a wand and then trying to believe that the wand chose me.

Did the formulation for House Mongolian Sauce at 360 change?
As per title.

I definitely recall being able to eat it easily as it was the only non spicy sauce I could stomach, but now I can't eat any dish with that sauce without setting my mouth on fire. Not to mention, there are new red pepper flakes in the sauce.
--------------------------------------------------
For those getting vaccine on campus!

advice?
As many have read, I have dropped my classes and will be headed back to TX.

I am trying to sell everything inside my home, I have posted it in every SD page, UCSD 3.0, and offer up. I can not seem to get any response, any idea why? I have even posted "\*make any offer\*"

Incoming student here--what is SPIS?
I'm a Data Science major and I came across SPIS when I was researching what I could do over the summer. It seems interesting, but how rigorous is the program? My family is thinking of going a vacation during the same time, so I would have to miss a few days (1-3 days). Would this be ok?

Question for current dsc majors
Hi guys, I’m currently taking dsc20 with Marina Langlois and I feel extremely stressed. I cannot write a single line of code for some of the homework questions. For the other ones, I really struggle to get to the correct output. I am questioning if my decision to major in this field is wrong. For those of you out there, how did you make it through classes like this? I feel impossible for me get through the other classes taught by Prof Langlois. But there’s two more classes like this...

Edit: Also anyone planning on taking dsc30 this summer? Is that class not taught by prof Langlois? (On canvas it says staff right now and there is a notice that the class won’t be recorded so I’m hoping it might not be prof Langlois)
--------------------------------------------------
Computer Science VS Data Science
I’m a little confused about which undergraduate major to go into. I find both interesting and the defining point for me now is which one is more worthwhile in terms of their professional scope.

TL;DR what can I do with a CS vs data science undergraduate major?

Econ 100A
Was wondering if anyone else has Tocoian for 100A and is screwed for the midterm? She’s really nice and all but her lectures are so bad - she’s literally just reading the slides. She’s not explaining anything clearly (I’ve learned more from the videos and textbook than her lectures) and her midterm questions look nothing like the problem sets... 
idk might just me being stupid I’m just sad

What have the lines been like outside RIMAC this past week since everyone has been eligible to get a vaccine the last few days?
Curious if anyone who might be around there from time to time has a sense on how busy it is. Wondering if it’s better to try to get a vaccine now or if it might be easier to hold off another couple weeks for things to settle down.

I totally missed out this year living on campus and was hoping to live at or near UCSD in the fall. But I'm having trouble finding any information on how i could do this.
