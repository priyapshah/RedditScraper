Housing options near North Campus
Hey everyone, I'm an international grad student planning on joining Rackham this fall and I really liked Northwood community apartments I-II. The shared housing options seemed nice and the rent was reasonable compared to off campus options. While I submitted my application in mid April, I heard students only hear back about the allocation about a month before the move in date (which would be in early July in my case).

Since not all applicants get an apartment at Northwood and since most of the reasonably priced off campus housing options (e.g. Parc Pointe) get signed around May or June for the upcoming year, I wanted to know if signing an off campus housing lease now would be a good idea? Also, I'm not sure how the cancellation terms in the leases work. Is cancelling the lease an option if I get a unit at Northwood? What would be the typical terms or penalties imposed for cancelling an already signed lease?


PS: most of the information above is based on what I have read online and based on what current or previous UM students told me. So, please feel free to correct or point out any inaccuracies. Thanks in advance!

Ap physics C Mechanics credit at UofM?
HI, I just committed to UofM and I’m taking the Physics C Mechanics tomorrow. From what I understand, if I can get a 5 on this exam I will get more physics credit but I still can’t straight-up skip the phys-140/141 class, is this correct?

Summer gym passes?
I'm gonna be on campus this summer and would love to continue going to the gym, but I know membership changes depending on if you're taking classes or not. Does anyone know the current status for getting a membership pass as an unenrolled student? I'm getting some conflicted information on the website so I'm not quite sure!

Help sanitation workers in India brave the pandemic
**TL;DR Donate** [https://gofund.me/7e05bce0](https://gofund.me/7e05bce0)

A bunch of us students from EECS and UMSI are raising funds for sanitation workers in India who play a critical role in helping reduce the spread of COVID-19 but have received little training or protective equipment.[ A recent survey](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/little-protection-for-sanitation-workers-during-covid-19-pandemic-finds-survey/article32550790.ece) found that only “30.7% of sanitation workers received masks, 22.4% received gloves, 31.1% received soaps, and just 18.9% received sanitizers”. Of these workers, many are "manual scavengers," primarily from the Dalit community. These workers manually remove human waste from dry latrines, sewers, and septic tanks and face significant health risks, in addition to financial hardships and caste discrimination. 

We have put together a GoFundMe campaign for [Safai Karmachari Andolan](https://www.safaikarmachariandolan.org/) (translation *Sanitation Workers' Movement*), led by Ramon Magsaysay awardee [Bezwada Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezwada_Wilson) supporting them. Funds will be used to procure PPE and immediate rehabilitation needs of sanitation workers. Please donate if you can and share widely with your networks. [https://gofund.me/7e05bce0](https://gofund.me/7e05bce0)

Context: Over the past few weeks, India has been reeling from the devastating effects of a second COVID-19 wave. The official government tally has exceeded 350,000 positive cases and 3,000 deaths on average *per day,* leaving hospitals full and crematoriums overflowing. But, many experts, including U of M’s chair of Epidemiology, Dr. Bhramar Mukherjee, believe that the actual number of cases and deaths are at least [2-5 times higher than those reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/24/world/asia/india-coronavirus-deaths.html).

Math 115 experiences?
Decoy title/flair because I don't know who might see this. Sorry if you were actually ready to share your experience. I'm not actually taking that class it was just the first one that came to my mind. This is about something much different I just need to vent (sorry to the mods if this isn't appropriate)

I'm terrified and I am hopelessly trapped. I am so scared.

Just moved out of my dorm last Thursday. I've been dreading this moment all semester. I'm back with my parents, who just finished a 30-minute argument about me downstairs.

I hate my family. I hate them so much. And I am stuck here for 4 months.

Everyone always talks about how excited they are for summer break. I'm dying to get back to school.

I'm so scared of my mom I'm so terrified

My poor dad is always trying to defend me but it never works out well for him. That's how the fight started.

And I have no way out. I can't afford an apartment and even if I did I'd still have to rely on them for some things and be in contact with them. There is literally no realistic way out of this because I just couldn't cut them off if I tried. I got in a car accident some time ago and have huge difficulty driving now so I can't even leave the house on my own terms. Even though I'm a grown adult. I am physically trapped.

My brother goes to school in a different state. His lease lasts all through the summer so he's not coming home. It's just me. Stuck here.

Anyways if any eecs folks have ideas on how to make a discrete, makeshift lock for an inward door with a handle that can open up or down that would be great

Question Regarding Housing Email
Hey everyone! Around a week ago, I committed to UMich through the application portal and paid my enrollment deposit (of $300, if I'm not mistaken). I read on the UM site that the next step moving forward would be to fill out my Housing Request Form that's supposed to reach me by email, but it's been a week and I still haven't received one, whereas my friend got his on the day of his enrollment deposit. 

I was wondering if I should be worried or if this waiting time is standard. I also read that after May 5th, housing preferences are not guaranteed and so I'm really looking to submit my application before the that time.

Any help/advice would be appreciated!

Oh and my college is LSA (I'm not sure if this matters or not).

Advice for keeping track of and planning required credits
Hiya, just as the title says.

And additionally a way to tally credits you currently have


Maybe an app or a chart?

Residential College Roomates
I'm going to be a freshman in the residential college next year and I was wondering if the RC has a survey you can take about what kind of person you are/what type of roommate you would prefer before assigning you a roommate? I know that there is a general survey offered for housing but since I can only room with other people in the RC I don't think doing that would work as you can't specify that you're an RC student on it. Sorry if this question makes no sense lol, I didn't know how else to phrase it.

Ultimate Bucket List
Hello!

I'm currently trying to create the ultimate bucket list for students here at the University of Michigan. 

I'm hoping to poll the entire community to get inputs for this - because I think this would be something really cool to pass on to future generations, especially since there was a lot that was lost due to COVID concerns.

When this project is complete, I plan to do a follow-up post and share it with the entire community. 

If you have any ideas or possible inputs, please either comment them on this subreddit or submit them to this form - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTHlET1ix58ncDWCYDNoQKhrKy3f9JjeFIfk3RKyl-T0YJfg/viewform

Anyone staying at The One during the Fall?
Finding affordable off campus housing was honestly such a pain, but I think I’ve decided on staying at The One. I know it’s a little far (2 miles from central) but tbh $950 a month for such good amenities and a really huge apartment (1590 square feet or something) seems worth it. Although, I don’t really understand why such a new property would be so cheap... any clues on what the ‘catch’ would be?

Anyway, I just wanted to know if a lot of you will be staying there as well.
--------------------------------------------------
Downside to living south of campus?
Been looking at 1BD 1BA apts within a 15min drive of North Quad and there are a couple (Emerson, Woodland News, Briar Cove) near Briarwood Mall that have similar - if not better - prices than the lower-quality ones nearer campus.

Looks likes its only a 25min total bus ride + walk to North Quad, so thats not bad. Seems a little too good to be true.

What are some of the downsides of being this far out? It doesn't feel super "Ann Arbor-y" but i think that's ok.

Btw - i'm a grad student, so being near parties and a ton of social life isn't all that important.

Conflicted about the co-op I'm in, considering leaving
I'm referring to the co op I'm moving to for the Fall-Winter term 2021-2022 A big part of this is my own personal preferences / experiences so this is not a "shitting on co-ops" thread.

TL;DR: Had shitty roomates / dysfunctional family maknig me really nervous about moving into a house where I'm already getting egh vibes from the roommates. Wondering how mcuh money I'd loose in a Linder contract buy back and if it'd be possible / worth it to live in a different living arrangement. Thank you for any advice.

Here's the deal, I'm currently, until late August, in a rooming situation where the roommate has been a total hypocrite. On my ass to do, reasonable things like keeping the kitchen clean, don't be noisy . . .but guess what? She does all of the bad shit herself. She leaves dishes in the sink, does other annoying things, so many that I have had to hold my tongue back or else I'd be classified a bitch with all the complaining I'd have. Basically I've had to hold my tongue. She kept having her boyfriend and friends over when the pandemic was still raging strong, I had to spell out to her that wasn't OK finally and the place just, reeks half the time.

I had a . kind of annoying and demeaning roommate last semester too and lived with a dysfunctional family I cut off last semester. They taught me to just grin and bear when people were maknig me uncomfortable, hence the stream of roommates who just take advantage of me, because they find they can. And I just, I chose to live in a co op so that food was covered with my rent. I recently got to meet with my co-op house, and I just get, not great vibes? Like they aren't bad people, but they're going to not be amazing roomates. I feel sort of on the outside of the circle already. I just sort of have the same, ergh vibes I had when I met this roomate like "They're nice, but the idea of living with them feels kind of bleak". So I want to try to avoid making the same mistake of living with people I end up havingto jsut, tolerate while they eat away at my mental health out of having very different standards.

&#x200B;

So I'm considering doing a co-op contract buy out. I put down $575, do I loose any of that money I put down? I'm at Linder which is a popular place, so it shouldn't be difficult. If you feel like I should just sta, feel free to say that. Would it be difficult to find a different place now during the summer? Has anyone noticed the options left in the summer being sus? I don't know, I'm just assesing my options. I'd prob use the food pantry if not living in a co op, so I don't need to worrry about getting a job since right now my brain just cannot work efficiently. It's looking like that's due to undiagnosed ADHD as worknig through my depression hasn't really improved this.

&#x200B;

Any input is much appreciated. TL;DR on top.

UMSI Class Recommendations for New Student
Hi UMich Reddit,

I'm a new transfer student, who is going to start attending UMich in the fall and I'm extremely excited! UMich has been my dream school since high school, and as an OOS student, I never thought I could afford to go. Anyways, I'm going into the School of Information, and I was wondering if current students could give me some insight on what to take. I'm between taking SI 106 and SI 206. By taking SI 106 it delays my ability to take SI 339 and SI 206 till the winter semester, however, I am leaning more towards SI 106, because I am somewhat nervous about my coding ability. I am not the best when it comes to Python, so over the summer, I plan to take Umich's Intro to Python course via Couresa to prep. Could current students give me some insight on how hard the courses are and what they would recommend doing? Something else to note is I am going to try to minor in something too. I am currently a marketing and psy minor at my current university, however, I missed the deadline to apply to Ross and UMich doesn't have a psy minor sadly, so I'll probably have to start fresh when minoring in something.

&#x200B;

Thanks for your help!

Interview for MSW program.
Hello,

I recently applied to the MSW program and just got an email asking for an interview. I’m taking this as a good sign in hopes that Michigan is seriously considering me.

It’s always been my dream to attend UofM and with them also having the #1 social work program I want this more than anything. 

My gpa is good but not where I want it, I think I had a strong essay and really good recommendations...but I have no clue what the interview process will look like or what questions they will ask.

I wondered if anyone else had to interview for the MSW program and what their experience was like?

Any insight or advice is greatly appreciated!

Public Health Major
I am currently a junior in high school and plan on applying to Michigan for the Public Health major (community and global public health) and know that this is something you would do your sophomore year. I am wondering which majors I could apply for as a freshman to meet the requirements in the future. If any of you know about or know someone who’s done something similar I would appreciate any feedback!

Edit: I also hope to Major or Minor in Public Policy so any comments on that area would be appreciated as well I don’t know too much about it yet.

So much for UMich :(
Michigan has been my dream school since hs; however, I was hesitant in applying cause I didn’t think I would get in.  At the last minute some of my teachers convinced me to fill out an application.  In December, I was accepted into Wisconsin early action with a full ride.  I was so surprised and grateful that I committed a week later.  I withdrew my other apps and didn’t see my Michigan decision.

Fast forward a year and a half later, I regret not waiting.  I don’t feel as if UW Madison is the right school for me and figured I should give Michigan another shot (without withdrawing this time).  I applied as a transfer and a few months later received my acceptance.  It was one of the best moments of my life honestly because I wanted it for so long.

Then I got my aid... the aid wasn’t the best.  I would have been 100k in debt coming out of UMich if I transferred vs 0 from Wisconsin.  I just had to fill out the form saying I will not be attending Michigan and it was such a sad thing for me to do 😢.  Thank you all for being so helpful and answering a bunch of my questions!  Seems like you got a great community here.

MATH 217 Schedule of Topics
Is there anyone whose taken MATH 217 in recent semesters who still has a copy of a schedule of topics with what text is important. I want to get ahead on the material before I take it this fall.

Past BIO 173 A cutoff
I just got my grade inputted for bio 173 and had an A- with a 94+ %

Has anyone taken this course and can tell me there past cutoffs or what percent they got and ended up getting an A. I genuinely think he decided to make it harder to get an A on this semester even though it was online.

Math 412 and Math 463 difficulty
Hey all, hope everyone is doin okay in the final push or happy to be done!

I was thinking about taking math 412 (mod algebra) or math 463 (math model biology) or perhaps even both in fall (both seems like a bad idea with math at this school tho lmao) and I was wondering about their relative difficulty when compared to 217. I found the concepts in 217 decently intuitive, but the workload was definitely a lot. I know 412 is much more abstract. Are either of these classes close in workload? I understand 463 is near entirely computational, so a different type of work. Is taking both manageable? If not, which is a less taxing workload? I intend to take both eventually though, so no ultimatum there!

TIA!

Seeking a comprehensive understanding of housing
Hello. Going to be a sophomore next fall. I stayed home for my entire first year, only being to AA once in a great while. Understandably, my options for next year are many, and I'm making this post to hear about individual's experiences in their housing situation.

I'm aware of:

* Renting a house with many people
* Rending an apartment/condo
* Dorm contract with the University
* Co-ops

I suppose there are many learning communities, and special housing situations given by the university (I remember reading somewhere about an international housing community). Are there any more lesser known communities that should be brought to my attention?

Another question I have is the cost-analysis breakdown for trying to get a dorm situation versus an apartment. I've been told by my family (college grads) that the dorm experience from a social aspect is worth the thousands of markup in cost for rent and food. I'm not sure what to believe. The reason I ask, cost is definitely a factor in this, and I'm not sure what the tradeoffs are. Is dorm life THAT much social/superior?

Within this, there are many different types of dorms as far as the number of people, and many different physical dorms I could go to, with each their own quirk. I know I won't be able to decide this explicitly in my housing application, but any thoughts? Curious to hear any and all perspectives.

How to find an Honors Housing roommate?
I just got into LSA Honors and I’ll be attending next  and I don’t really want a random roommate but the roommate finder doesn’t have anything about interests/lifestyle, just actual roommate stuff (which is also important ofc but I care about the other stuff too).

All of the roommate matching services I’ve found haven’t had anything about only wanting someone in honors as a roommate and obviously I need someone in honors to live in honors.

Where should I be looking to find someone to live with from the honors program? Ty!

Chances of getting into Northwood I or II housing --- grad student
I'm an engineering graduate student moving to Ann Arbor in the fall. I recently applied to live in the Northwood I and II graduate housing dorms. Unfortunately, University of Michigan won't tell me anything about  availability in this apartment complex or even when they can let me know about availability!

I don't plan on owning a car and I'm going to be living off a modest Ph.D. stipend, so my housing options are relatively limited... Should I be signing a lease at another apartment complex now? Or should I risk waiting to hear back about the Northwood situation?

  
Thanks in advance!

I moved to NJ and I live with my mom, i’m happy here, I was offered a full time job in a laboratory, and I’m taking the other final credits I need to graduate online.

But this one damn class that I dropped last fall because I had a bad semester, I need it to graduate with my degree. I recognize this is my fault, I just need advice.

I emailed the professor, I’m awaiting a response. I emailed my advisor, he said basically said “you can’t take it remotely, just move back to ann arbor,” and I was like alright thanks for the suggestion....

What else should I do? Am I going to have to move back to Ann Arbor for one 3 credit class in the fall because I f’ed up last fall? 😔

Thanks in advance :)

Ann Arbor parties?
I have a friend coming to AA this weekend and want to drink with him pretty belligerently. Can anyone steer me to some frat parties/house parties this weekend I could pull up to? Bars are out of the question as he is under 21 without a fake ID. Please let me know, and covid is not an issue!
--------------------------------------------------
Greek Life
I want to join a frat that doesn’t haze but has sick parties? Any recommendations for next year. Also they need to be COVID safe.

How is commuting to campus?
Hi, I will be attending umich this fall and was wondering how commuting to campus is. I would have about a 30-minute drive from where I live, is it hard to find parking? I'm trying to decide if commuting or staying in an apartment near campus would be better. I'll be attending the school of public health for my B.S.
--------------------------------------------------
Where to UMSI grad students live?
I can't imagine i'm the only introverted grad student who's adamant on living alone this Fall. It seems like North campus is the best place for me because it's quiet and most of my classes will be on that side of campus. When people say North Campus, which apartments are they usually referring to? And is there any chance i can find a 1BR 1BA with decent amenities and in range of the buses for under $1500? And can I count on commuter lots if I need to drive a bit to be picked up by the buses?

Wolverine Powerlifting
Hey y'all! 

Back again with some Powerlifting news! 

Been applying to get the club created and official with CCI. However, I have begun compiling together a list of interested people, which has already surpassed 15 people ranging from freshmen to graduate students! 

So this is a call to all who are interested in joining a Powerlifting community @ Umich. We have an instagram group for the time being where we all communicate until more official channels of comms are stablished. 

Shoot me a direct message in my DMs and we can get is all started! 

This is also for all those incoming freshmen as well! We have a bunch in the group already :D 

&#x200B;

Special shoutout to u/tooth__ and u/EveryNightisTacoNite for the help!

PS: Good Luck on finals Everyone <3

What makes UMich unique?
I am trying to decide on a school and I was wondering if any of you could comment and tell me what is special about UMich that makes you love it and happy about your choice to attend? Maybe something along the lines of cool traditions or opportunities?
--------------------------------------------------
Help convince parents
I was admitted into Michigan early action and the school has remained my top choice since then. I also later got into Emory Oxford and my parents have been stuck on sending me there. How do I convince my parents to let me go to UMich instead of Emory.

The cost will be the same for both schools and I live in Georgia. I also plan on majoring in either pre-med or business.

They seem to like how Emory is in state and they think that the smaller environment at Emory would help me more and that I am too irresponsible to go out of state to a big school.

Probability of Getting off EECS 281 Waitlist
I just added myself to one of the 281 discussions and I am on the the 4th position. But all the lectures are full and I am on the 9th position of a lecture. I wonder whether it would be possible to get into any 281 class before the fall semester. Thanks.

EECS 203
I want to take EECS 203 this summer but from what I’ve heard I’m not sure taking it at Michigan is a good idea. What are the cheapest/easiest places to take EECS 203 for transfer credit over the summer if any of you have done that??? I was hoping to find somewhere where the class isn’t as awful, stressful, and time-consuming.

Is University of Michigan well known for it's STEM program because of it's close ties to the Automotive industry?
I have been researching college rankings quite a bit and I have noticed that University of Michigan is usually ranked fairly high up especially for it's Engineering and Medical programs. I am not too familiar with schools in the Midwest but from what I think, the reason University of Michigan seems to have a good reputation is due to it's ties to the Automotive industry.

&#x200B;

I know Stanford and UC Berkeley and others are known for having close ties to the tech industry like Facebook, Apple, Google etc. so does University of Michigan really have close ties and what relations does it have to the Auto industry particularly with Ford, GM and Chrysler? do a lot of alumni from UofM aspire to work for them?

CPT for undeclared CS-LSA
I’m an F-1 transfer (held I-20 two years) intending to major in CS-LSA. I would like to do an internship this summer, and am trying to navigate the employment sponsorship process and everything, but am quite lost. The [international center webpage](https://internationalcenter.umich.edu/students/f1-students/cpt) says for “Non-Required CPT”, a requirement is “You must have declared a major”. But I haven’t because I just completed EECS 280 this semester. 

How strict is this requirement, and does CS-LSA have “Required CPT” (and if so, how can I make use of this)? 

If it is very strict and I won’t be able to successfully apply for CPT, is there any other way I can do this internship? Or is CPT the only way for an international student to do an internship? (i.e., can the company intending to hire me sponsor me somehow? If so, would this make them think twice about hiring me?)

I’m just very lost and worried that I will lose this opportunity because of all the hoops I have to jump through and the little details in the requirements that I fail to meet. Can anyone who has been through this process or been in a similar predicament provide some advice, please? 

**TL;DR**: F-1 sophomore transfer intending to major in CS-LSA but not declared. Want to apply for CPT but might not meet all the requirements. Can I still do the internship somehow without CPT (and is this common), or is it necessary?

COVID Vaccine Requirement & Freshman Housing.
Incoming freshman and I just got the email about the covid vaccine being required. I haven't gotten the vaccine and don't plan to for a couple more years. Some questions I have:

1. Anyone else surprised that they are requiring it (seems illegal)?
2. Can freshman live in apartments?
3. If yes to 2, what are some cheap apartment options?

Thanks homies. xoxo

Re-applying to LSA Honors
Hi, 

I'm a prospective freshman recently denied acceptance to the LSA Honors Program. I was thinking of re-applying at the end of my first term at Umich. I heard honors advising and classes(supposedly GPA booster?) are helpful for premeds(like me). 

1. Would it still be worth it? 
2. Do I just need excellent grades my first term?
3. Do I still need to write the same application essays? 
4. What advantages am I missing out on for not being in honors?
5.  Do I move to South quad if I'm in honors my second term? 

Thanks! :)
--------------------------------------------------
My mind is going dark again
I only got into U of M from pure aggression, aggression fueled by anger. I was unhappy with where I was in my life and pushed myself beyond my normal capacities and ended up in U of M. 

I was scared to come at first because it was such a dramatic shift, but I decided to come and see what was different. The curriculum was more difficult but my interest in Computer Science kept me going. I love and do well on the projects given in courses like EECS 281, and EECS 440, I just like working on projects. 

But for some reason, I just can’t get past EECS 370, I might be failing it for a 2nd time, and I’m sure I’ll be the first student to be taking it a 3rd time. Even if I pass, it’s making me think, why am I so close to failing it again?
And I have to just accept the fact that maybe I’ve become complacent.

Now I’m feeling this anger that I haven’t felt in the 2 years I’ve been here. It’s the same anger I had when I wanted to leave my previous environment. I want to graduate from U of M but not in any normal way. I want to escape, just like before. I’ve become fearful over these past few semesters of how close I’ve come to failing and barely scraping by. I’ve only failed once so far which was EECS 370. Failing it again is too much. Anything more it’ll get to the point where I will burn through my grant money. At that point I won’t be able to afford coming here anymore and all the effort would’ve gone to waste. My time enrolled at this university has went from curiosity, and amazement, and has slowly been turning into annoyance then anxiety and constant fear, and now I’m seeing darkness and my body is shaking from intense anger. Now I feel like I’m being pushed to become that raging individual again... which brings the absolute worse out of me.

There are these moments in my life I can’t often remember because there’s just this intense amount of anger and aggression from within me in response to where I’m at in my life. I feel like I lose entire months sometimes because I just turn everything and everyone away. I came here because I wanted to experience something new and I did and it was fun. I don’t want to go back to being so angry, but I feel I’m going to let it happen again regardless if I pass 370 or not because... I unfortunately need it. I can’t go to full capacity without feeling a hatred towards something, and now that hatred is aimed at UofM. But I acknowledge it is my fault for getting to this position, for being complacent, for letting my guard down. I should’ve treated this environment like any other before it, an enemy something trying to hurt me either physically, mentally, or financially. I need to shutdown. Go back to how I was in order to pass. I need to pass these courses and move on with my life. I want to forget about ever being here. Just one more year. . . One more year.

I shouldn’t feel this way about this university, this was suppose to be my escape from a bad place, why do I feel this intense hatred and anger again I was suppose to love this place . . .

Leniency in EECS
Any thoughts or opinions on the leniency of EECS? Just realized that I had been emailing the wrong professor in order to get a short extension, and emailed the admin. Long story short, missed a quiz, realized I missed it and the autograder, took late days, and asked if I could get a quiz extension since I took late days for the autograder. Im literally like 2 points below a good letter grade and the quiz bumps me to it. 

What’re my chances?

MS in CSE?
Hey, I was admitted to the CSE master's program at UofM Ann Arbor a month ago but still didn't decide whether or not I should accept this offer. I am computer science major in undergrad. So I would like to ask some last-minute questions. Does anyone know if it is reasonable to finish the master's program in one year? (I saw it in the graduate program guide saying that it is possible to complete 30 credit hours in one year). I am planning to spend only one year on master's and looking for a job during this year. I don't want to spend too much time on it since I want to get a job asap, another reason is that the cost is kinda high for me for staying more than 1 year (I'm from out-of-state). 

Does anyone have any advice? How are CS courses at the EECS department? Is the cost worth it? Any information will be greatly appreciated! Also, how do Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) and Graduate Student Research Assistant (GRSA) work here? I saw that these positions can be used to pay for the tuition. Is it difficult to get a position from them?
--------------------------------------------------
A desperate request
Hello guys, since some months ago I'm trying to get a book that is avaible in your library, but I'm having no luck. I know that many of you will tell me to buy it and pay for the shipping, but it's literally imposible to me since I lack the necessary money (it's not only expensive by itself, but also, in my country -Argentine- you have to pay a ton of taxes for anything that needs some kind of currency change). I've found that this book is avaible in your library thanks to Hathitrust, which has an online version of it but it's only unlocked to students from your university. If some of you can help me downloading it (there are a lot of programs to do it from Hathitrust and it's legal), I would be extremely gratefull since its a major source for my thesis work.

&#x200B;

Thank you in advance, and I send you my best regards.  


PS: the book in question is "Memoirs" of King Abdullah ibn Hussein al Hashim of Transjordan

Pros and Cons on living on North vs Central
Hey! I'm currently a grad student who is living on North campus. I like how peaceful it is and most of my classes are on North but at the same time sometimes miss that everything else is on the other campus. I do have a car but sometimes parking can be difficult. 

I've been having a few issues with my current apartment and I'm hoping to move when the lease ends in August. I found an apartment by S Main Street and the apartment faces the road. It's also about a 10 min walk to Michigan Stadium. I'm just wondering what the pros and cons would be to move to central in terms of safety, noise, etc. Or if I should find another apartment on North. I've only lived in Ann Arbor for a few months now and was hoping to get some insight from other people who've lived here longer. Thank you!

Coming to visit Michigan this weekend (Sunday)

Completing an I-9 Remotely
I'm going to be working for the university remotely this summer and need some help with the authorized representative portion of the I-9 form. I am wondering if anyone has been in a similar spot? If so, how did you get the portion filled out (did you have to find an authorized rep in your local area or did the university give you one)?

I live 9+ hours away from Ann Arbor so going there to complete the form is not really an option. Thank you!

Edit: thank you all so much for the responses, saved me a lot of time and stress! :)

Should I do LSA Honors?
I was just accepted into LSA Honors and need to let them know if I want to do it by Friday. The thing is is that I definitely am not interested in the Freshman Honors Housing and am wondering if the program is worth it without it as everyone says that is the biggest pro. I also plan on going to law school and definitely don't want to do it if it will be a GPA deflator. Does anyone know how the difficulty or workload of honors courses compares to regular LSA courses/ if the program makes it any more or less difficult to fulfill requirements? Or grade distribution in LSA honors courses? Need advice!!

Asking suggestions for undergraduate summer research
I’m a transfer student who is not in Ann Arbor right now. But I hope to access some of professors to start my undergraduate research ASAP during this summer. By checking the official website, I think urop may be a good option, but I still wonder whether it is viable if I contact directly the professor whose topics I am interested in. Thanks for your suggestions.

Just bombed my last final.
Like, bad enough to where I'm almost certain I failed the class (which is an 8 credit course). It will entirely ruin any chance of me graduating when I planned to and my financial aid is surely gonna get whacked. But, weirdly enough, I don't care. Not in the slightest. Something like this would have been devastating to me at any other point in my life, but now I'm just happy it's over...

The beauty of English 125
 

Hey all, I am writing this as a student who has just finished taking an english 125 course. Throughout taking it, I have learned a lot, both regarding myself, and regarding writing as a whole, so I want to post it here to give you all an idea of what one can expect from this course. At the beginning of my time taking english 125, I was an unpolished writer who believed in the strict 5-paragraph essay, and that any deviation from that was incorrect or unnatural. Anything out of the ordinary, whether it be using “i” in my papers, or contractions, were simply not going to occur throughout my writing. However, through my time in this course, I have grown a lot as a writer. I am now more able to be flexible and elastic in my papers, and if I feel it will help my writing, I’m happy to use I as much as the “I” can see. I especially learned a lot regarding this idea in John Warner’s “*Kill the 5 Paragraph Essay”* (I will include the link to this piece at the end of this post). In my close reading of this text, I felt I became aware of what was most important as a writer, that being to appeal to one’s audience. There is a specific example of this in Warner’s piece as well, as he explains the importance of his instructor teaching him “a number of different things, genre awareness, audience, structure and sequencing.” (2) This truly does stand out to me, as in just having a flexible essay structure of our own, it is so much easier to develop our own ideas, and structure our own texts accordingly. I must admit, at the beginning it certainly felt like I was handling a bunch of stray ideas, with no clue how to piece them together at the start of my writing on both of my papers this semester. At the end though, once the smoke cleared, they both felt much more cohesive and honest than if they had been placed under the classic rigid structure that my 9th grade teachers of old would have employed. I truly feel that the skills taught to me in this course will be essential as I continue my journey as a writer, as the ability to work flexibly and alter one’s writing cannot be understated, especially in a world with so many possible ideas to write about. I definitely would advise any incoming students that read this and that are planning on taking an ENG 125 course to really try and use this class as a learning experience. Use your essays as foundations to put your ideas onto a page, and don’t worry about structure until after. If you really try to do your best and try new things during your papers in this class, you will 100% improve as a writer.  I certainly feel as if my writing is a lot more cohesive and structured now, and this has helped me a lot even just for assignments in my other classes that I’m taking. The main reason I’m glad I took this course though was because it was a sort of refresh in my mind. As young writers we are taught many rigid, rubric-bound ideas when it comes with regard to our essays, and we aren’t allowed to do much else. The problem with this though is that there is little room to improve and grow when trapped with the same means of writing. Through all the texts we read through this semester, there was a common theme; that being that growth and excellence in writing could come in a multitude of ways, and that one should not feel constricted to the format of their assignment. By allowing myself to be freed from the standard 5-paragraph MLA mess of a prison, I have grown innumerably as a writer, and I have to thank this course for it. Although this class seems intimidating, it is worth it. Consider taking it if you are incoming next semester. Have a great day guys and remember to kill the 5 paragraph essay.

C- in MATH216

UM Culture
Hi all, I am a prospective masters student for the MSI (UX specialization) and wanted to know what the general consensus around fall semester and beyond was going to be:

1. How much in person will the university potentially be in the fall?
   1. If the university has to cancel in person classes, are they well prepared to switch to virtual?
2. How has virtual changed how to get a job and build your resume for masters students?
3. Are people in An Arbor generally good about getting vaccinated?
4. How well do people follow stay at home orders?
5. What is the general UM Masters culture like?
6. Is it easy for masters students to get engaged and make friends?  Before and after covid?

My older sister went to state and I know their campus is more spaced out but she used her bike a lot while living there so I was wondering if you guys think it would be a smart idea to have one with me next year.

Incoming grad student. When do I get information and what are the next steps?
I’m an incoming Ph.D. student and I’m super excited to start! I may be a little too excited to start since I’ve been anxiously waiting for information from the program after accepting the offer. When do we typically get information? Also is our stipend supposed to show up on financial aid in the Wolverine website? 

I also wanted to know what the next steps are once you accept the offer. Do we keep in contact with the professors we met at the interview throughout the summer? Do we ask to join lab group meetings? Do we tell them we want to rotate with them? Just kind of wondering what the typical etiquette is.

LSA degree requirements and courseload
Hey, I am an incoming transfer student and I am hoping to pursue a pure math major and graduate in two years. However, I am quite confused about the degree requirements. For example,  can this RCHUMS 312 be used to fulfill ULWR, HU, and RE requirements? Or it can only be used to fulfill one of the three requirements?

Also, I still need to take 9-10 math courses to finish the pure math major. How will it feel if I take 3-4 math courses in one semester, say MATH 412, MATH 433, MATH 462, and MATH 555? Will such a courseload be manageable? Thank you!

I just miss feeling like a good student
With the constant imposter syndrome and ineffective online learning, I haven't developed a single relationship with a professor during my time here since my first semester of freshman year. My motivation to learn and connect is gone because I feel I don't have the ability to, and finals is just kicking me while I'm down. I'm really looking forward to a fresh start next year, but I say that every semester. Please tell me I'm not the only one.
--------------------------------------------------
Anyone else just feel like they’re not good enough?
I come from one of the worst school districts in the United States. I am also the only student from my high school attending umich at the moment. I have a 3.6 GPA, I work, and I volunteer a little, but I still feel like I’m not good enough for this school. Everyone here just seems to have all of these achievements that they earned easily, while my best work is still bottom of the barrel in comparison. Does anyone else feel this way, or am I just overthink it...?
--------------------------------------------------
I miss campus so much
I have a love-hate relationship with this school, so I never knew that I would feel this way, but I realized I really miss campus when I noticed myself watching people make youtube/tik tok videos on a college campus and I would try to see from the background if it was our campus or not. Any college campus I see I'd be like "That looks like U-M, lemme get a closer look." 
I'm graduating this week, so I'll never be back on campus 😥. Sorta upsetting.

Anyone knows is it permitted to double ds and cs?
I have seen from the major requirements on the stats website few months ago, saying doubling ds and cs is not permitted any longer. However, I just see this rule has been deleted.
I am a little bit confused about it.
--------------------------------------------------
Pursuing a CS minor but very hesitantly (advice?)
I took EECS 183 and enjoyed it. I understood most of the stuff and did well on most of the projects, the final group one was really hard for me but other than that I feel like it went well, so I decided I wanted to minor in CS. I am now on my second attempt at EECS 203 and I feel like I'm losing steam. This course is so hard for me, even the second time around (especially because I BOMBED the second midterm due to outside circumstances in my life) but I'm hesitantly hopeful that I may pass. 

I'm taking 280 over the spring semester and I'm very nervous. Is 280 more doable than 203? I've heard both ways and could really use some encouragement but also honesty because I don't know if I can do this.

Dorm beds
Hello everyone,
I was recently admitting to UM and I have a question about the dorms. I am 7 feet tall so I was wondering if it will be difficult for me to fit in the bed, and in the desk since I think they are placed under the beds. If not, is there anything I can do about it besides not live in the dorms? Thanks a lot.

Do International Students need to be vaccinated prior to entering the UMich campus this Fall?
Now that UMich has officially made it a requirement for any incoming and returning students to get vaccinated for them to be on campus, my question is: do International Students need to get the vaccine before going into the UMich campus? Because in my country, vaccines are rolling out VERY SLOWLY - I might not be able to receive my vaccine before going over to Michigan 😪😪

Thanks for your help in advance! :)

Anyone else tired from online learning/ Zoom fatigue?
Personally I am. In person lectures were definitely more engaging and I liked them much better. Online learning is so tiring and the asynchronous video lectures are so long. Not to mention that it is practically difficult to talk to people/socialize online. Seriously cannot wait for actual in person learning, what about u guys?

CS at Umich LSA?
Hey, I'm an admitted student and just trying to get a better idea of the program. What do you like? What do you not like?

**Edit: I'm looking to get a job right out of college -- no grad school. Not sure if that changes things.** My other option is UF (full-ride). I'd be in-state for Umich.

Umich Ross for tech roles
Hey y’all, I was accepted into Ross a couple weeks ago and still haven’t decided on whether I shid commit or not.

Incoming Student: MLC's (MRADS) and M-STEM (M-Engin) Situation
Hi! I'm an incoming student in engineering. 

I was recently admitted to the M-Engin Program (which sounds really awesome to me!), but I also want to apply to MRADS.

The thing is, I only have until April 29th to notify M-Engin of my intent to accept the offer, and I haven't even submitted my MRADS application yet.

MRADS attracts me because of the residential component and because I've heard mixed things about the M-STEM/M-Engin program (but also a ton of other things about the MLC itself haha). Additionally, most of the M-Engin program is online this summer, which takes away from much of its appeal (normally there is a 6-week residential program over the summer) and I think it might be a better use of time to get some credits from a CC (I'm an out-of-state student so I would save a lot of money). 

What should I do? I definitely don't want to turn down my offer, but it also doesn't give me time to see how my MRADS application works out. 

If anyone has any experiences with either MRADS or M-Engin, please share! 

&#x200B;

Thanks! :)

Questions from a prospective student
I am currently in high school and had some questions about the school

1. If I decide engineering is not for me would I still have good options in other fields if I change majors?
2. Will the engineering coursework be too hard if I don’t have any previous engineering knowledge?
3. Do engineering students hangout with people with other majors?
4. I am really interested in the arts and STEM, I wanna know how the balance is there? 
5. How bad is stress culture and how hard is it to adjust to the difficult level of the classes for engineering?
6. I want to know if the environment is more friendly and collaborative or competitive, especially in engineering?
7. What is the social scene/Greek life like there?
--------------------------------------------------
Any advice for prospective engineering student?
Last fall I applied to Michigan just to see if I would get in--I literally completed the application in a day. To my complete surprise, I received a substantial scholarship from UofM, one that I would be stupid to turn down. I've spent my whole senior year preparing to go to MSU, so I am rather unfamiliar with UofM. I was hoping someone could help fill me in on what to expect at Michigan and what I can do to prepare myself. I can't help but feel under prepared to study at UofM, partly because I lack self-efficacy. With that said, I do have a few questions that I could use some help with. For reference, I am planning to study computer engineering.

Does anyone know of any good online courses for physics and calculus? I haven't taken high school physics or calculus (I have taken college algebra tho), so I was hoping to gain some knowledge on the subjects prior to my enrollment. I am not looking  to earn any college credit. I was considering using Aleks for a math class, but I have no idea about a physics course.

Also, what programing language(s) should I learn before I start classes? I am currently taking a course on python at a nearby college (the course is programming logic), which I found to be extremely easy. I was waitlisted for Google CSSI, so there is a decent chance I could get into that. I think JavaScript is the language covered in the program. 

Not related to academics at all, but is there any parking options for freshman? I know it is discouraged for freshman to have cars, but I want to be able to go home on the weekends.

I really appreciate any insight or help that anyone gives. I'm sure everything will work out fine, but I just want to make informed decisions.
--------------------------------------------------
Living Business Theme Community
Prospective student here, I just wanted to reach out and ask what the Living Business community is like because I haven't been able to find any real student experiences online. 

Michigan's website simply describes it as a diverse, supportive community with academic and networking opportunities. 

Is it competitive to get into? Or do most applications get accepted? Any advice on how I can maximize my odds is welcome.

Thanks in advance!

hi! I'm very sorry if this is a bad question to post, I did my best to look online before posting this, but the links I can find online are broken and it's hard to find stuff about the michigan daily on this sub that isn't just news articles. so I'm hoping someone with a clearer answer might see this question!

I'm an incoming freshman for fall 2021, and I'm interested in joining the michigan daily, if possible. but like I said, I can't seem to find substantial info on how to apply - does anyone here know how? and can I join with no previous journalism experience? how competitive is it? 

thanks for any help :)

For people traveling soon, the 1 dose J&J vaccine is available at Meijer Saline Road, Ann Arbor this week
Helpful information if you're planning to move out of town/take a flight/go abroad after the semester ends and can't take the 2 dose vaccines in time. I've checked with most other pharmacies in the next 30 miles and none are offering the 1 dose J&J.

Currently the Meijer Saline Road pharmacy is pooling people for it, so it's best you call 734-997-3910 soon to get added (choose the option to talk to pharmacy staff).

That's all, best of wishes to you all for your finals.

Michigan LSA math requirements (Prospective Student)
Hi all,

I was just admitted to class of '25!  I was wondering how hard it was to fill the QR/Math requirement. I am considering being a sociology/Spanish major. I do not think I have to take Calculus, but I was wondering if fulfilling the math requirement for a non STEM major was too bad? I saw some sociology/ Stats classes that seem to fill the requirement. Also, do honors students have to take honors math? Thank you so much! Go blue!

MSW Program
Hi everyone! I am considering applying for the MSW program (to attend in fall 2022) and I was hoping I could get some honest feedback on the experience you've had, whether you were able to gain connections that furthered your career post-degree, quality of the content of the education was, opportunities for field work, etc. My biggest concern is primarily the price tag and whether you thought the program was worth it. 

For context: I've worked in a variety of human services/nonprofit positions (including currently at a food bank) and I have a bachelor's in theatre (lol I know). Should I apply I'd be going for the Policy & Political Social Work pathway. I would also be moving from Nebraska, so out-of-state tuition. 

Anything advice or thoughts you have to offer is very appreciated!

School of Information
School of Information

I am a rising freshman in college, and I got into UIUC, UMD, and UMich. I want to major in Information or Information Science, and focus in on UX Design. I got into UMich for LSA because the School of Information is not available for freshmen and sophomores. I was wondering if it’s worth spending that much for the first two years if I would basically be doing general education courses. I also wanted to know if I would have to apply again once I’m a sophomore in order to actually go into Information as a major, and what the details and chances of that are. If anyone knows about the path to a career in Product Design / UX Design from UMich, please let me know if we can talk! Thanks :)

Some questions about housing and RC
So I have a spot in the residential college but tbh I’m not that stoked about the randomly assigned roommates thing. I haven’t received my housing application yet but I was wondering if I could still apply for regular housing and then decide if I still wanna do RC once I get my housing assignment back? I’m honestly very confused about how the whole housing, rc, mlc thing works. 

Also if I don’t do RC, how hard is it to get into RC lang classes because I’m still interested in doing intensive language classes. 

Finally does anyone have any idea of what the rough distribution of freshman is across central campus, the hill and north campus? Is it pretty rare to see freshman assigned to a dorm on central campus? I’m just trying to get an idea of what my chances are.
--------------------------------------------------
Freshmen housing?
Hey all, currently I'm applying for housing as an incoming freshman. I'm wondering whether or not I should put north neighborhood as my first preference. The app says Bursley hall is where most freshmen live. is north campus close to freshmen classes (just in general,  I don't have anything chosen yet) Personally, I'd like to be on central campus.  I'm just wondering what the best choice is in terms of general proximity, environment, etc.

Just looking for some housing advice- I am completely in the dark, here.

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: I plan on being premed, so some of my classes would be in the world of science, like bio and whatever. I haven't explicitly chosen anything, however.

Double Major/Dual Degree
Hey guys!

First of all, i’ve been lurking on this sub for a while, and it really seems like Michigan is such a supportive community. I was accepted into LSA, for fall enrolment - and i had a couple questions.

Recently, I began wanting to double major - between Ross and LSA. If i am currently an LSA student, is this possible? What’s the procedure for this? Is it doable? Would really appreciate any light shed on this.

Secondly, are there any Dual-Degree programs for LSA students? I know it’s possible for someone who applied to, and got accepted to Ross, but what about an LSA student? 

I know i should have just applied to Ross, but this was a rather recent change for me. Would appreciate anything you can say.

Thank you :)

Any advice?
Hey guys, 
I am a freshman that just finished my first semester at umich. After taking eecs 183, and seeing how easy it was for others when it was such a struggle for me made me feel kinda lost. i was just wondering to all my comp sci peeps on how to improve in c++ or if there are any websites that I can go through to prepare myself for EECS 280. I really want to do understand this but I am having trouble for coding to click in my brain. Is this normal, and are there any websites you recommend that do a great job in making you proficient in c++. Thank you guys so much! I truly mean it.

CS-LSA major wanting to take EE/CE related classes
Hello!

I'm currently majoring in CS-LSA, abut after taking EECS 370 I've become interested in the hardware side of things. I also recently learned what an "embedded system" is and that might also be applicable to what I want to learn. I'm aware of classes like EECS 373, 470, and 270, but I'm slightly concerned that not being in the college of engineering and taking classes like EECS 215 would hinder my learning experience. At the same time, EE/CE classes like 215 sound really interesting and I would love to build a foundational understanding in that field. I'm kinda just spewing out thoughts at this point but basically, what classes would you guys recommend me to take if I wanted to learn how to build embedded systems as a CS-LSA major with very little knowledge of EE/CE?

Immediately taking 281 in Spring despite taking it in Winter
Hi, I was curious - is it possible to immediately register for 281 in the Spring even though I'm in it right now? I haven't seen any previous threads about this.

I don't think I did too well on the final and may not get the minimum competency. How will the timeline work out? Upon grades being released is there enough time to register for it in Spring? I really don't want to end up having to do 281 next Winter because I'm already doing 370 and 376 in the Fall.

Thanks for any help.

I'm On a Hunt: Have you ever worked at Quickie Burger?
Hey everyone! 

My name is Cheyanne, and I'm about to graduate from UMich. My freshman year, I fell in love with Quickie Burger (to this day, it is the best burger I've ever had). Something about their spice blend recipe and the secret sauce just absolutely blew me away and I fell in love. Coming back the next year, I was so saddened to learn that the owner had silently closed the restaurant's doors over the summer, and since then... I've told every family member, friend, and acquaintance I have about the mystical Quickie Burger. 

In the last few months, I've found myself once again craving a Quickie Burger. However, due to the development of chronic illnesses, I have some significant dietary restrictions... so even if someone could magically re-open the store, I couldn't buy one. My body doesn't tolerate red meat anymore. 

That being said, has anyone on this subreddit worked at Quickie in the past and still know the recipe (even a little bit)? I'd love to re-make it at home, within the scope of my restrictions, and I would give ANYTHING for my friends, my partner, and my family to be able to give it a try. I'd cherish that recipe forever and pass it down from generation to generation. I realized that this is likely my last hope, as I'll be leaving town in July for grad school. 

&#x200B;

**TLDR: ISO a former Quickie Burger employee who remembers the burger recipe, so that I can make and cherish it within the scope of my dietary restrictions for ages to come**

Instate cc vs instate university transfer

I know umich states that they need to have higher priority for residents that live in Michigan attending cc as they serve the people of Michigan. If I’m a person who is instate attending a 4 year university and I would like to transfer, would my priority be lower than a person instate who goes to cc? I have always seen that community college students have higher priority, I think it’s because they’re guaranteed to be in state. Do they only mention cc because of the guaranteed instate regarding the fact that only instate matters, or does cc vs 4 year matter?

Past Students Say Professor of Rock ’n’ Roll Sexually Harassed Them
"Six former University of Michigan students have filed legal papers accusing a [former lecturer \[Bruce Conforth\]](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/23/arts/music/university-of-michigan-bruce-conforth.html?searchResultPosition=1) of sexually harassing them and the school of not doing enough to protect them....

In 2008, one recent graduate complained to the university that Mr. Conforth, a lecturer in the American Culture Department, had propositioned her when she was a student. The university put him on formal notice but quietly resolved the complaint. Two more women came forward, though, in 2016, to report that Mr. Conforth had worked to engage them in sexual relationships when they were his students, and, in the midst of the university’s investigation, he agreed to quietly leave his faculty position.

Now six former Michigan undergraduates — the three women who previously complained and three others — have filed court papers announcing their intention to sue him and the university, asserting he engaged in a litany of sexual misconduct and the school failed to protect them.

“He should have been fired,” said Isabelle Brourman, one of the women. “But they allowed him to thrive. They allowed him to win awards.”"

I feel like  paper exams, and the lectures that are  no longer being recorded, would be a huge huge step back for specifically cs classes.  Can anyone tell me what it was like before covid. IE I'm going to miss using my own IDE and computer. Personally panopto videos were extremely helpful for learning the material. also being able to go to any  professors lecture, also proved useful. Last office hours were way more approachable when they were moved online.

UMich Student Life
I'm a prospective student for the 2021-2022 academic year who was recently accepted into LSA.

Could anyone perhaps provide insight into what the academics, support and residential life are like at UMich?

Note: I'm aware that um is known for the balance between the social scene and the academic rigor, however, one of my main worries is the sheer size of the school. I intuitively think that given the size, each student is less supported for things like internships or at the career center or whatnot.

Ross and Public Health
Hey everyone

I've been doing some research but I am a bit lost because I couldn't really find my exact answer, so I was hoping someone could help me answer it. Let's say you got into LSA and decided to apply as a transfer applicant to Ross and got admitted for your sophomore year, is it possible to do a dual degree with the School of Public Health. I know that you apply for public health as a sophomore and do the program for your 3rd and 4th year, but can you be admitted to Ross your sophomore year and public health your junior year? I'm just a bit confused. Thank you!

&#x200B;

tldr: Can you major in business administration and public health (B.A. or B.S.)?

What are UMich engineering students like?
Admitted student considering EECS and I was wondering what are UMich engineering students like? How nerdy are students? Are engineers different from LSA or Ross students at all? I know it can be hard to generalize but are there any certain types of engineers at UMich?

God Bless Nice Professors
Just got an alternate exam time for my physics final when I really was not expecting to get an alternate time at all.

I’ve been getting migraines like nonstop this past week and I’ve been super stressed bc I haven’t been able to study for finals, so I emailed the department on a whim and my prof granted me an extension(!!), even though it’s not in the exam policy. It’s not even a complete day later but honestly it means the world to me that profs are still trying to be considerate of students’ circumstances and more lenient during the pandemic.

Basically, Thank Goodness to all the professors who have tried to make this year just a little bit less stressful. T.T

Dear Dr.________ Canvas is not that hard.

CHEM 351...wow
Has anyone else felt like this class this semester is an absolute sh!t show? Im full aware that CHEM 351 was hard before COVID started, but I feel like I’m the only one who thinks Nolta’s lectures are all over the place with no structure! She laughs when our exam averages are in the low-mid 50s and we don’t really know what our  true letter grades are. It also doesn’t help when the GSI doesn’t get along with the instructor and they don’t coordinate their materials together, making the discussions useless. Please tell me I’m not the only one feeling these frustrations

Are undergrads working with professors usually paid? What are the hourly wages like (I’d imagine it’s something like 10-15$ )?
Should I bring this up if a professor I reached out to offered me a research position on her team, or should I wait for her to say something ?

I would be greatful for the experience itself honestly , I’m just curious and need to plan my finances

I am super stoked to come to Michigan this fall, I just have a question about high school GPA
Michigan calculates high school student’s gpa in a weird way. They go unweighted and don’t count +/- so an A- is an A and a B+ is also a B. My question regarding this is that for the end of this year should I stress on getting all As this year or should I just focus on getting A-s. Keep in mind I want to try to transfer to the business school after one year at LSA Econ.

To Lease or not to Lease is the question!
Hi Everyone! 
I hope you all are doing well
I am an incoming grad student at University of Michigan Ann Arbor and I have been looking at housing options near the north campus. I am an international student and US consulates in my country are closed due to the second wave (yayy covid -.-) and hence Visa dates are not available till September. The cases in AA have been increasing as well and that brings up the question of whether UMich will have online classes next sem. If that happens, I'll most probably defer my admit to Fall 2022. 

I have a lease in my hand of an apartment that I like but I've not signed it yet. The scenario is still very unpredictable and in case I decide to defer I'll have to pay 15k USD 🥲 
The housing options are selling out pretty fast and that just increases my anxiety. What should I do? Should I wait till I get a clearer picture about Fall 2021 or should I sign my lease?

Cheap housing
Anyone who’s looking for cheap housing for the school year should look into the co ops!! I currently live at them and it’s amazing. You pay about $750 a month and it includes food + dinner 4/5 days a week and amenities. Plus they have rad parties and the people you live with are pretty cool too. Black elk is my favorite just because it’s in a more chill neighborhood (near burns park), it’s vegetarian, there’s awesome outdoor space, and we’re really close to central. Only downside is you will probably have a roommate but honestly it’s not that bad, the vibes are still chill. Seriously tho you’ll meet the most interesting, beautiful, and kind people.[Icc website](https://icc.coop)

Laptop questions for graduate engineering student
Hi all! I am looking to purchase a new laptop, but I am not sure what I need to get. I will be a graduate student studying Biomedical Engineering starting this fall. My main questions are: Do I need a laptop that is robust enough to download necessary engineering software provided by a university? Or is all software accessible through a virtual desktop, so I just need a device that supports that? Alternately, do I need a basic laptop that is capable of supporting documents, PDFs, Microsoft office, note taking, etc.? Basically, I am trying to figure out how fancy I need to go, depending on what will be required of this laptop while I'm a student. Thanks in advance!

Urgent Question about declaring my major
Hello,

I'm LSA student who just finished my freshman year.

For some reason, I have to declare my major as Econ as soon as possible.

I understand that prerequisite of Econ major is

Econ 101 & 102, and Math 115, but I didn't take Math115 yet.

In fact, before I transfer in, I took Cal 1 class in other University, but Umich didn't transfer it to Math 115.

In this situation, will there be any way that I can declare the major?

Thanks a lot guys!

It shouldn't cost money to be able to succeed at the school after we've already paid out of our ass to be here
There are many students who could succeed through high school and, after getting depression or because they had a learning disability their whole lives that starts fucking them over in college's less structured environment, now they need to get evaluated for some disorder so they can get access to the help they need.

&#x200B;

Totally reasonable right? Only problem is, a lot of this stuff, is hella expensive. Particularly, a neuropsych evaluation, which is the only way to get the accommodations you need to succeed, is a whopping $1K+ depending on your insurance.

So to be clear, after paying a bunch of money to attend this school, and maayybbee get a degree, if you find your brain that got you into the school starts fucking up and won't cooperate, you now have to pay 1K just to figure out what's wrong with it, and get help if something is wrong wwith it.  There are cheaper options, but therapy copays quickly add up, medication if you're not lucky adds up, psychological evaluations still cost a lot . .. 

&#x200B;

There's no cheap way to get help if your brain craps out, and kids at a top rank school are more likely to deal with this and what the hell do we do. Yes there are emergency funding resources that can help you but those feel iffy, not guranteed, like it's jsut so messed up these school resources cost this much to begin with. That alone is stressful

Unsatisfying end of the term - anyone else?
I have a couple finals coming up within the next few days and while I'm more than ready to get this over with and finally end this semester, I can't help but notice this feeling of emptiness towards it all. Maybe it's that online, you don't get that satisfying feeling of walking out of an exam room into the fresh air and feeling all accomplished (not even knowing your grade yet) and excited to finally get home and have it be break. It's more so: submit - sit in your chair for a few minutes trying to recuperate after those stressful last few minutes - blink hard because your eyes are fried from the screen - and think uhh.. what do i do now?

I know in my heart that I worked pretty dang hard this semester, harder than any semester I've had before, as many of us obviously have this term, but that sense of fulfillment is just not there and instead just gratitude that the misery is over which i feel are distinctly different.

# Is it possible to transfer from LSA to Ross at umich?

Hi folks, I got into LSA for econ but am planning on a cross-campus transfer to Ross. I heard many say that this is very challenging and that my chances would be low. Does anyone know if this is true? also, if I don't get in, can I still minor in Ross while majoring in econ at LSA?

AP Credits
Hi, I am seriously considering attending Ross but I have some questions about how AP credits translate to the Business curriculum. If I have enough credits to skip most, if not all, the first-year LSA credits, does that mean that I can begin taking ross classes before my second year? Also, can any of the business students give me some insight on how the atmosphere is at Mich? The toxicity and competitiveness I've read in some places have been a small concern that I have.

Puzzlehunt Club @ UofM
Would anyone be interested in starting a puzzlehunt club at UofM? A puzzlehunt is essentially a competition of teams to solve puzzles, and when I say puzzles I don’t mean board game puzzles. It’s more involved and interesting, and uses a hugeee variety of mediums.

Lots of unis have puzzlehunt events, with [MIT’s](https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/) being the most famous.

Good examples of the kinda ~vibe of a puzzle hunts are like Cicada 3301, puzzle boxes, cryptography, like[ Kryptos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kryptos), the Dan Brown Robert Langdon books or really just any mystery books.

Also,[Wikipedia ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_hunt) description:

A puzzle hunt can happen at a particular location, in multiple locations, or via the Internet. In a puzzle hunt, a puzzle is usually not accompanied by direct instructions for how to solve it (although the puzzle's title and its "flavor text" will often hint at how to solve it). Puzzles may come in familiar types such as crossword puzzles, jigsaw puzzles, cryptograms, and others, but often involve an additional twist beyond the usual structures of such puzzles that solvers must discover; other puzzles may have innovative structures whose mechanics solvers must work out from scratch. Groups of puzzles in a puzzle hunt are often connected by a metapuzzle, which is a puzzle based on combining or comparing the answers of other puzzles.

I just created a post asking about interesting/fun classes that was deleted, and then I was referred to the megathread. Prior to it being deleted it was getting some really *helpful* discussion and answers. 

The issue with the megathread is, well, it’s mega big. Who wants to sift through that mess? For those of us who are asking for help here, I’d argue plopping a question into that pile will end up with lower quality answers. 

Sorry, fellow U-M folks, but the practice of shuffling discussion into the megathread sucks.

Looking for Judo/BJJ/Kali schools in Ann Arbor
Hello!

I'm close to getting my second vaccine soon, and I want to start exercising. I'm terribly out of shape.

I've always wanted to learn Judo and BJJ, but Kali also seem very interesting.

What I want to achieve from attending classes:

1. **Make friends** (most important)
2. Become healthier while practicing in safe manner (I've had nasty sports injuries before, and I don't want that again)
3. Learn the art, not necessarily for street fights or competitions, so instructors who're enthusiastic about educating would be a very big plus.

Can anyone recommend a place that have good people that aren't crazy competitive or aggressive, I would very much appreciate it. 

If the martial arts schools are either closed or only doing online classes, then I'll just wait until they can open back up.

&#x200B;

Some of the places I found:

1. URSA academy
2. Ann Arbor Mixed Martial Arts
3. Japanese Martial Arts Center

Worth transferring here from MSU?
Hey guys

I've been admitted to transfer to LSA for fall 2021. I lived in Ann Arbor my whole life and this was always the college I assumed I would go to, and I hear from a lot of people that it's supposed to be one of the best universities in the U.S

But from my time reading about what people write on r/uofm and comparing it to r/msu, I've become a bit hesitant to accept my admissions offer

Students here seem to be really unhappy with the classes on average compared to the students on r/msu. Here, I keep reading about stuff like:

\- rude professors with material split over multiple websites in a complex way, not giving rubrics or clear due dates

\- How horrible EECS 281 is with piazza posts going unanswered, long office hours queues

\- How awful Calc 1,2,3 are run

\- Labs that require a huge amount of work not actually related to the course or covered on tests

\-"Inquiry Based Learning" 

\-Normalization of mental health issues  


Whereas on r/msu, people more just complain about specific professors, or maybe how a class wasn't taught in a way that was "fun". Is it really this bad at Umich?

Spring/Summer Semester Finacial Aid
I enrolled in a few classes during the Spring and Summer semester and I am currently receiving the GoBlueGarentee to attend school here. I just found out that they don't allow GoBlue to cover the costs of classes over the summer. I was completely shocked that this is the case considering the GoBlue grant covers 4 and 1/2 years or completion of my 1st Bachelor's degree (whichever comes first I believe). I didn't even realize that I would be completely screwed paying almost 6 grand for 3 classes until I saw it mentioned all the way at the bottom of the GoBlue site just now. Is there any other way I can find grants this late? Maybe even grants that cover the summer semester? Any information that anyone can provide me would be greatly appreciated.

My reaction to Plasmadynamics and Electric Propulsion Laboratory
TL;DR: Pretty impressive laboratory. I mean, it is a multi-million dollar facility, so kind of expected. Nevertheless, the technologies researched **were more diverse and way more innovative** than what I imagined them to be.

&#x200B;

I got admitted to UMich CoE about 3 weeks ago. Here's my reaction to scrolling through the [Plasmadynamics and Electric Propulsion Laboratory (PEPL) website](https://pepl.engin.umich.edu/).

Starting with the mission statement, it sounds like the typical rhetoric of a research lab, but what caught my eye was *"Identify non-propulsion applications of EP systems."* Now that's an oxymoron. So I went to [*"Learn more."*](https://pepl.engin.umich.edu/about/)

Saw some history. It was a vacuum test facility started in the 1960s to simulated space and test for lunar rovers until it was donated to UMich in 1982 and converted into PEPL in the early 1990s. In 21st century, PEPL tested the [NSTAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Solar_Technology_Application_Readiness) and Hall Effect thrusters. So pretty impressive. I mean, kind of expected from a multi-million dollar facility.

Scrolled down, looked at some information on Electric Propulsion (EP). Figured out that PEPL does more than just ion engines (i.e. using an electric field to shoot out ions at high speed for thrust). Apparently, they do electrothermal and electromagnetic propulsion as well. I was like "wow. Didn't know that. Way better than what I expected it to be." 

People won NASA and AIAA Sperry awards, so that's good.

Now to the real part, what is the lab doing:

Looking to use Nitrogen and Water as potential fuel for ionization/propulsion. Honestly, that's so creative. How come I never thought of that. I was always like, just put some noble gases like Xenon and bombard it with electrons. But that in-situ resource utilization is so smart. Looking forward to that!

They thought of ways to increase thrust. That's expected. I mean a high-power electric propulsion lab in Georgia Tech is also working on that. After all, thrust is a downside to ion propulsion.

There are way more things PEPL is doing that I didn't get to react to. I have to go to dinner now. But whatever research PEPL is conducting is really creative and innovative. Look forward to working with these when I enroll at UMich. Go Blue!!

Bad experiences on the Ann Arbor Buses
I don’t know if it’s just because i’m unlucky or a girl or something but I’m majorly sketched out by the ann arbor buses. I’ve been catcalled on the bus and at the bus station. Last time I was on a bus a guy told me I could sit on their lap as a walked down the isle and a women who didn’t look like she owned a kitchen offered me weed brownies. I just don’t feel safe on the bus - and I’ve never taken it alone. It’s just lame because I want to get around.

Off Campus Housing - too late?
I'm a sophomore looking for a plan B in case I don't get dorm housing for the Fall 2021 term. I know that returning students aren't guaranteed housing, so I figured I might as well start looking for apartments/houses now.

I also don't wanna be spending more than $1000 per month on rent.

I also don't know anyone well enough to room with them, since this year was basically remote.

Are there any websites I could use to find people that are in the same situation and are looking to find housing too?

Thanks

Does anyone else consider timed, hand-written exams in a remote setting kinda inequitable?
Specifically engineering classes where you need to show your work for calculations, but yeah for me personally it adds a large extra layer of anxiety for every round of midterms/finals, when your grade not only depends on your ability to solve the exam in time, but you're also relying on your computer, internet connection, scanner, or for many people your phone that you use to scan the exam pages, all these things you need to perform properly in this exact time window. I say inequitable because these issues are more likely to affect low-income students. I've done well on my exams and thankfully nothing like this has happened, but I have had some "small" issues with my computer this year that if it had happened during an exam, I would've been screwed. Not sure what a better solution would be but yeah, feels bad.

for cse majors, what did your freshman schedules look like?
i’m an incoming student and was wondering about the typical ratio of stem-non stem classes, how many eecs classes people generally take during first year, gen eds etc. 

also i do have ap calc credit but i’m an international student and took it under atypical circumstances in 2020 so i was contemplating if it was worth not using the credit and just taking the intro classes so my basics aren’t weak for higher level classes. if anyone has done this pls tell me if you found it worth it or not!! i might be considering a stats double major if that’s relevant

Double Majoring in Computer Science & Information Science
Transfer Student Double Major Question

Hello, I am thinking of transferring to UofM as a junior. 
I would like to know if I would be able to double major in Computer Science and Information Science! Is that possible to complete and allowed to take at the same time? 
Thank you for anyone’s help!!

Financial aid appeal
So the financial aid office said to send in supporting documentation/a personal statement in order to make an appeal, but once I sent it in, they said they aren’t considering them until around July. Is it normal to wait that long for financial aid appeals? I’d like to go to Michigan, but my commitment is pretty much dependent on what I can afford.

Is Ann Arbor boring? Be honest with a prospective student
Hi! I was admitted to Ross for this fall and I was wondering you guys would be able to describe what Ann Arbor is like? I tried looking this up on google but all I found was another Reddit post by a millennial guy comparing about how “Ann Arbor is hell for young professionals” lmao. Is Ann Arbor boring, especially for someone who’s used to living near a big city? Where do you guys go for internships? Thank you so much!

Graduation Help
Hi friends -

Obligatory not a student but: my very best friend is graduating from UoM this semester. I'm super excited for him. Unfortunately, I recently had to move back to our home town in Colorado, because I was recently widowed. He is struggling hard. And a big part of that is the loss of any sort of support structure, because unfortunately even though I'm a mess, we've really relied on each other throughout covid.

All of  his classes or online, and he doesn't live on campus, so he hasn't had to keep up with the covid screening rules in place this year. He called me almost in tears tonight because he tried to go get his gown today, and cannot get into the bookstore because he hasn't had a recent screening. He has 3 projects due this week, and he is really stressed that he won't have the time to go get screened and go to the bookstore.

If there is anyone on campus who has the ability to take some time in the next couple of days to run to Ulrich's or Barnes's and Noble and grab one for him, I would be so appreciative. I'm not sure exactly what they require, but he's really intent on getting a UofM specific one, not one from Amazon. I'm not sure if you need his ID/school number, but I can get all of that information. I will obviously be paying for this - I have venmo and paypal, but I'd be willing to download Cashapp as well if they allows transfers on the same day as signing up. He lives in town, and I'd pass his number off so you can meet in a public place or however works best for you.

I know this is long and all of it is kind of a stretch. But I'm really banking on some of that Midwest hospitality. Ann Arbor was such a lovely place, and I miss it so much. This friend literally saved my life after my partner passed away, and I just really want to help in this small way. He feels really alone right now, and I'd love to bring a little bit of light to his last week of school. I can't be there for him actually graduating, and none of his family can either. I just want him to feel a little less alone

dining when living in alice lloyd?

Transfer student to UM
I'm a senior in high school who was accepted into Umich LSA (pre med), but I didn't qualify for financial aid, so I decided that CC was my best option. I'm local so I'll be attending Schoolcraft. I was looking at the transfer requirements for LSA and I'm just really confused. I was hoping some of you could answer my questions here.

1. How many classes should I take in CC to be able to transfer to LSA and get my degree on time?
2. Should I take my pre med classes in CC?
3. Is 1 year or two years in CC advisable? I want to spend the least amount of time as possible in CC but I don't want to pay more than 60k.
4. Do most pre med transfers graduate on time?
5. How are transfers treated at UMich? Especially CC transfers?

that is all.

Any Double Majors here?
Hi, I’m an incoming student at LSA and I was wondering if there were any double majors here willing to chat about their courses and overall experience. I haven’t really been able to find anything online on the school’s website about credit costs, overlap for the 60 credits outside majors, or examples of previous student’s course progressions.

Thanks!

Questions about what to expect
I’m getting ready to apply to colleges, and I’m having some trouble deciding where I want to go with my decisions.  I think I really want to go to U of M, but here’s my dilemma.  It seems like it’s a really prestigious school(planning on hopefully doing something engineering related) and I like that, but also through high school I haven’t been able to do a lot of social things and make really good friends and just generally do fun stuff.  I was hoping college would be a place where I can get to do this stuff, but I’m not sure if I apply to a prestigious school if I will be able to balance school work and have a full social life.  Does anyone have any insight?

CSE Majors: Is this degree worth the cost?
Hey there. I'm an incoming freshman in CoE hoping to major in CS, and was looking for any advice from anyone who is going through/has gone through the program before, from a financial perspective. I'm fortunate that Michigan gave me pretty good aid for an OOS student, but as it stands I estimate that I will graduate with \~$28,000 in principal debt after four years.

This is by far the best school I have been admitted to, and the outcomes ([$101k](http://career.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2020/04/annualreport1819.pdf) median cs base salary according to 2019 coe salary report?) make the school seem worth it on paper over my other options (FSU, full ride with $66k median base). However, I'd really like to hear from some of you who go here or have gone here and taken out debt for this program-- before I make any huge commitments.

Some General Questions:

Do you feel that an education here is worth paying a premium for over a less rigorous school? Do you feel that your degree has opened doors for you that would otherwise be difficult to find? Has it been easy to find post-grad opportunities with solid base pay? Have you been able to find decently well paid internships. The salary report lists the median monthly CS internship pay at $4,853-- Is this actually a common figure?

I would really appreciate any input on my situation. I'm trying to gather as many opinions as possible before I make this decision. Thanks a ton!

MCard access after graduation
I’m a graduating senior, and I’m wondering what MCard privileges I have access to after May 1st. Can I still go inside buildings as long as I’m tested? Will I have access to rec sports facilities? My card says it expires August of 2022, but I don’t know exactly what this means in this context.

Is there any difference between MRADS and UROP other than the housing requirement?

Opportunities for non-SMTD students
Hi! 
I recently found out after receiving the max LSA OOS scholarship that I may have enough to go to umich now.  This is awesome as I love michigan of course, however, I was seriously ill this year and messed up a couple of my prescreenings, one of which happened to be umich. I got into more ‘selective’ colleges/conservatories for my instruments, but I’m on the fence on whether I should attend without the guarantee of a music degree with the teacher. However, I did not like the teacher for my instrument at the school I’m likely to be attending if I don’t go to UMich (I couldn’t afford my conservatories and this teacher has gotten sued by students for sexual harassment, was/is an alcoholic, and I walked into a meeting to hear him *screaming* at his students). I’m open to transferring only because I could not afford any of my schools this year and would apply on music to a different set, especially if I have to do an audition for UMich SMTD anyways. 

My question is; how am I supposed to take lessons or have musical opportunities that are at my level (or just below) if I’m not in the STMD? I got into Eastman, NEC, etc, but what if I don’t get accepted to SMTD or the teacher doesn’t like me for some reason? Is there anything else I can play in until I transfer if I decide to do that? To be frank, I have no idea how I was accepted EA when half of my application was severed by being rejected on music but I love UMich. I’m afraid I’m taking the real chance of never playing again. But I’m always one to gamble, and I believe I can be good enough to win, I’m just scared.

Question From An Incoming Student: M-Engin vs Learning communities?
I'll be coming to UofM next fall, and I applied to M-Engin. I haven't applied to any learning or theme communities, but I'm wondering if I should?

If I am admitted into M-Engin, are there any reasons I should consider learning communities over them?

I've heard mixed responses (on a few posts here) about M-Engin, so I basically want to know what you guys think. Should I have the opportunity, should I join M-Engin or a learning community?

Thanks!!

going into cs?
If I hate EECS 280, should I even go into cs? I'm debating whether or not to keep going with it to see if I like any of the upper levels

Interested in MRADS
I’m an incoming Freshman who just committed to CoE and I’m trying to sort out a housing situation which is all pretty daunting. I love the idea of the MLC’s but the only one to really interests me thus far has been MRADS. For anyone who’s been a part of it, what were your honest thoughts? Was it worth it for you, and how was your experience?

Also a few questions if anyone can answer them:

- What are the chances of being able to work on a research topic related to my field of interest? (Aerospace Engineering)
- Was the additional workload of the research project overwhelming for anyone as a Freshman? I typically deal well with large workloads but I’m also aware most students here do and there still seems to be quite a lot of deadline-related stress going around the subreddit
- Did you feel like you surrounded by like-minded students? I’ve had some really positive experiences with this when I lived in other states, which made me a lot more engaged in what I was doing and is why I’m interested in MLC’s, but I’ve also really struggled to find anyone that I clicked with at my current high school, which is something I’d like to avoid if possible at UoM

Unsure of my college decision (going to u of m)
I've learned a lot about colleges in the past year, especially small liberal arts ones. I applied to u of m not excepting to get in, but what do you know: I was admitted. My parents (and almost everyone around me) have said I need to go because it is objectively my best option. But I love the small college feeling and I'm upset because going to u of m means missing out on d3 swimming.

What are some things you like about u of m? I want to look forward to next year, not dread it.

For personal reasons I am not sure if I will be able to live in Freshmen housing in the fall. I still want to pay the housing deposit so I am guaranteed a place to say.

stress about post college
I’m a freshman but I recently decided I want to graduate in three years so I could pay less tuition but I’m so stressed out by it. 

I feel like my entire life was so college focused, it was always “do this to get into a good college”, and now that I’m actually here, it feels like it’s passing by way too quickly. I don’t know what my plans are after college but I do know that for all of them, I should probably be actively looking for research or internships right now — which i haven’t started.

idk, there was no point to this post, i’m just stressed out lol

edit for context: i’m a psych student with a cs minor, and my dream is to be a school psychologist, so I will likely try to get a masters

Do international students have the option to select a particular person as their roommates (assuming that person also writes your name down for their housing application)?

Also since Learning and Theme communities have different applications, how do you specify your preferences for which one you want to attend if you get into both types?

Work-study spring/summer positions?
Places I've checked:

General student employment website


And no dice on any of the jobs I've applied for yet. Any other suggestions? I don't want to lose my work-study award. I've heard student life has a hiring freeze going at the moment so no luck there. I've already worked for UU and don't want to go back there. Housing has no open positions. 

I don't know what to do, I was supposed to start my new job in early April but the day before my start date they shut out everyone except upper-level employees. My current position at a different place initially promised spring and summer employment but I've learned to stop believing them when they promise things by now.

Please help an anxious, soon-to-be-unemployed soul.

Dual enrollment college credits taken in a high school setting
Hey! I've admitted to UMich LSA, and I intend to study computer science. As an international student, I was forced to pay OOS tuition and I hope to graduate in 3 years with AP+college credits I earned in high school.

I've heard about the recent policy about AP credits no longer count during registration and I felt lucky since college credits would still count and I've taken some of them during high school. However, as I dig deeper into LSA policy ,unfortunately it seems that LSA would reject all of my credits simply because they were taken in a high school setting.

It seems to me that credit transfer is managed separately from college to college, and I wonder whether this policy applies to College of Engineering as well. From their website they said that "a dual enrollment form is no longer required", does this mean that they don't care if your college courses are earned in a high school, as long as they are from accredited higher education institutions? If I were to transfer from LSA to CoE freshman year, would they still accept these credits despite I was not admitted to CoE as a freshman?

Sorry if this seemed a complicated issue. I'd be extremely thankful if anyone has had any experience with this process would offer some insight.

Thank you in advance!

Confused about grad school/work
I've been pretty confused about what I will do after graduation. For some background, I'm currently a Mathematics and Computer science major at umich (with pure and financial concentrations in mathematics). I decided a few months ago that I would eventually like to pursue a phd in either applied mathematics or computer science. My end goal is to work in industry (ideally something to either do with quant finance or data science), however I'd like the graduate degree since I am very interested in pursuing further education in certain areas of mathematics and computer science. The problem is, I am a low-income student, and throughout my entire life money has always been an issue. Since I'll have a 4-year degree and hopefully the ability to a work a good job, I'm inclined to want to pursue full time employment out of university. I heard that phd and full-time employment is possible but extremely difficult, since a phd is essentially a full time job its self. I am a very goal driven person, and I am willing to sacrifice a lot to achieve what I want. I was wondering if anyone here was a phd student, and can lend me some advice as to how I can either make PhD financially achievable for my self. Preferably, I'd like to continue a graduate program at U of M (however I know its competitive) if given the opportunity, how much work do the graduate programs at U of M require?

Switching college on app?
I’m planning on reapplying for the winter term as I was rejected from the fall term, I found that there is an application changing form where I could use the same application without paying another fee. Originally I applied CoE but thinking about it now I’d like to do lsa cs and possibly take advantage and minor in other things offered by lsa that isn’t in CoE, I see that changing from coe to lsa would require a 200 word essay explaining why I would like to switch but my essays essentially speak to CoE classes that umich offers, would this “why switch” essay wipe those essays out or would it be a bad idea to switch since my why umich and other supplemental essays deal with CoE.

I’d like to reach out to the moderators of the Facebook and Instagram pages these students would likely be part of to see if I can post ads on their pages. However, I’m not a big social media user (and much too old to be in these groups myself!) so I don’t really know what pages first year undergrads would follow. Would really appreciate your advice! Thanks so much folks.

Apartment available - 5 min from central campus!
My school plans have recently changed, and I’m leaving my graduate program earlier than I initially planned. I need someone to take over my lease, starting at the end of July. The apartment is a studio on Forest Ave. It is in an apartment building, not a house, so you’ll have your own private bathroom and kitchen. 

Some perks (IMO):

(1) the location is FANTASTIC:

- 5 min walk from central campus
- 10 min walk from state street
- 10 min walk from the gym
- 7/11 is right down the street, which is super convenient if you ever need a snack / drink 
- also super close to Starbucks, No Thai, Pancheros, Brown Jug, etc— basically everything on South U

(2) you can live alone. If you value your privacy, this place is perfect. 

(3) since it’s off campus, you don’t have to get a meal plan. You can save money and cook for yourself. This is really nice, especially if you enjoy cooking. 

(4) the apartment isn’t huge, but there is a ton of cabinet/closet storage. The main closet is really big. If you’re living alone, the apartment is honestly a great size.

(5) maintenance staff is super nice and very responsive. If you ever have an issue, they are happy to help, even after hours.

(6) the apartment building has limited parking, but the building right next door will rent out parking spots to non-residents for ~$100/month (which is much cheaper and more convenient than a lot of parking options in AA)

Is anyone interested in this? If you’re a grad student like I am, I highly recommend this place if you don’t want to live with other people. In my opinion, paying a little bit more in rent in exchange for privacy has been completely worth it. Most other affordable places in AA are bedrooms in old houses. If you’re an undergrad, I believe this place will still be cheaper than living on campus. Please let me know if you’re interested and I’ll DM you!

In a recent interview, Schlissel said he expects 95-98% of campus to be vaccinated in the fall. But he said we still will have to wear masks and social distance. Can anyone explain this to me?
Here is the article: https://www.michigandaily.com/news/schlissel-fall-semester-will-feel-like-a-transition-to-a-normal-winter-22/

CDC literally just came out with a study showing that vaccines stop transmission so why would we still have to wear masks if 95% of people are vaccinated

Residential College Student/Social Life
Hi there! I was admitted to LSA and was planning on joining the RC. I really love the curriculum, but I wanted to ask what social life is like within the RC. I've been told RC students are typically pretty quirky and the party scene is not equivalent to the rest of the university's. Could anyone confirm or deny this for me? What does the social and party scene look like within the RC and what kind of people typically join the RC? I really love what the RC has to offer academically, but I'm now a little afraid I am not going to find my people within the RC. Thanks!

Questions for graduate students
I applied and was admitted into the Biomedical Engineering MS program for this fall. I took a break after undergrad, so it's been a couple years since I've been in school and I'm really anxious. What are graduate courses like here? What is it like being a grad student at U of M, in general? I'm anticipating a ton of work, but I also know I'm probably over stressing. Also, I am a little confused how courses work...do I take courses through Rackham or do I take them through the engineering school? I guess if there are any graduate students here that would be willing to talk about their experience so far that would be awesome. Or even undergraduate students that could talk about the school I'd appreciate it. I went to a small, private university for undergrad so this is a big change for me. Thanks in advance! :)

How are the city buses during snow?
I am an incoming law student this fall and currently looking into housing options. I'm trying to limit rent and I found a good price for a studio at an apartment complex near the State. St Park and Ride lot.

Because it is not walking distance to campus, I'm thinking about using the city bus system instead. I'll either walk to (or drive and park if I'm feeling lazy) at the Park and Ride lot and then ride the bus onto campus. I also saw that the University provides free taxi services after hours to the State St. Lot so it kind of seems perfect for what I'm looking for.

My only concern is the reliability of the the bus system - in particular RT 62 -  during winter storms. The city bus website says it runs during the snow but is that actually true? Any experiences? Would it be better to spend more money to live walking distance or is the bus system generally reliable even in the snow?

Math 217 final grade distribution?
Hello,

This is a question for people who took Math 217 last semester (Fall 2020). I know the class is graded out of a total of 200 points, and I was just curious about the distributions for letter grades from last semester. (A general sense of the distribution is okay too)
--------------------------------------------------
Intership/Job stats
Are there an statistics that show how many CS students get internships and jobs? I known COE does a big report with average salaries, but I’ve heard that it’s likely skewed because people with no jobs don’t fill out the form. Regardless, I’m in LSA CS, and seeing good employment stats for LSA CS students would lower my stress levels significantly, but all I can find is one really crappy page with college wide employment rates and average wages which are really low because of majors with no job market in LSA. 

If these stats aren’t anywhere, I’d honestly be disappointed in LSA because they preach interdisciplinary education but can’t even throw together one statistics based report... 

TLDR; I’m stressed about my ability to find an internship next summer and I’m on the verge of emailing the career center about their lack of statistics but I decided to vent here instead
--------------------------------------------------
Why do classes here at umich never give you time to digest all the info you learned
It’s like hours of lectures and lectures and over a hundreds something slides of information every week, and then tons of assignments along with the lectures weekly, and then boom! An exam! And guess what, you have to learn 50 slides of new material DURING the week of the exam too! And this is just for one class, I have to do the same for 3 other classes! I feel like they never give us the time to just go back and review all the materials. It’s not like those are easy materials that you will get right away after watching the lectures either, like they’re hard asf and need time to be digested and memorized. Ugh I hate school so much.

How to take a class and not have it show up on you transcript?
I want to take organic chemistry 1 (chem210) over the summer before I take it in the fall for credit. Bare with me, I know this sounds stupid, but I have nothing else going on the summer and I would like to be prepared in the fall. I was planning to take it at Henry Ford CC (cus it’s next to my house and like 300$). 

Today I met with my advisor and she said that if I audit the class at Henry Ford I will have to submit that transcript to medical schools/ health graduate schools (assuming that’s the path I choose to take). Meaning, graduate schools will see that I audited the class and that I took organic chemistry 2 times. 

She said the only way for it not to show up is if I take the class ‘no credit’. Henry Ford and umich don’t do this for organic chemistry. 

Any ideas on how I can take the course without having to inform med schools? I’m willing to pay for the class.

Hello All. I'm a sophomore CS student looking for experience this summer, and was wondering if any one knew of any Research Assistant positions that would be open to hiring a CS major.

--------------------------------------------------
Double Majoring, which degree are you conferred?
Hey all, this is kind of a dumb and not terribly important question, but I was wondering if, say, you were enrolled in LS&A as a double major in 2 majors where one by itself is a BS and the other is a BA, BSChem, whatever. I presume you are given one of the two. Is there an arbitrary "primary major" you choose? Is it whichever you declare first?

&#x200B;

TIA!
--------------------------------------------------
(URGENT) What to do in case of a health crisis?
Hi all, someone I know in the CoE is passing a kidney stone right now. She's been in severe pain for the past 3 days and currently has a pretty bad fever. We're not sure how much longer this is going to last, but it could be days or even weeks. Deadlines aren't slowing down, however--she has an assignment due tonight that she haven't been able to work on, 3 projects due the 19th, another assignment due the 21st, and 2 exams on the 23rd. She's tried emailing professors and nobody is responding. We need to know if there's some kind of system in place for health emergencies that will allow her some leniency on her assignments. She's been working really hard this semester and it would really suck if her grades tanked right at the end due to unexpected health complications.

It should be mentioned that this isn't the first time this has happened. She once had a kidney stone in the middle of an exam and had to leave halfway through. The professor graded the work that she had gotten done by that point and didn't allow her to re-take it. All this is to say that I don't really expect much from her professors, so I'm looking for a way to get help from a place of higher authority.

EDIT: She called the Dean of Students Office, and they said that they'd contact the CoE and get things sorted out, so hopefully that will be enough.
--------------------------------------------------
Am I too behind for a CS major?
Currently, I'm a sophomore (Junior in the fall) in LSA undeclared. I want to do a dual major Cogsci and CS, but I'm worried I'm behind. I've taken 183, 203, and 280, and am taking calc2 over the summer so i can declare in the fall. However, I can't afford Spring tuition, so I have to take 281 in the fall along with 370. Most people I know in my position (sophomores taking 280 rn), are taking 281 in the spring. I initially registered to take it in the Spring but after the invoice hit our account, my parents and I realized it was way too much for us to handle. If I take 281 and 370 in the fall and postpone 376 (it's not a prereq for the ULCS I want to take), would I be really behind? I want to be in a good place when I graduate, I'm just really concerned I'm behind the other CS majors.

EECS 301 in Spring 2021
I was tossing around the idea of graduating a semester early, and taking EECS 301 in this Spring 2021 semester is the key to doing that for me. However, it seems that Mark Schlissel may have caught wind of this and wants to milk me for that sweet upper-level tuition for an extra semester.

What this actually means: I received an email today that if the class (currently has 14/40 slots filled) doesn't receive more students by this Friday, the EECS department will cancel the class.

So, please consider taking EECS 301 in the upcoming Spring 2021 semester. It's all virtual, all asynchronous, and COVID graded. I'll be your study buddy or setup something else up if you want, but I need this class to continue.

Quick housing question
I am doing my housing application right now and I came to the part where if asks for preferences and lists Single, Two Room Triple/Two Room Quad, Double and Economy Double.

My top two are Double and Two Room Quad/Two Room Triple. But now my mom is trying to tell me that Two Room Quad and Two Room Triple mean 8 and 6 people respectively when I thought it meant 4 and 3.

It does mean 4 and 3 right? Cause I don’t think living with 8 or 6 people would be all that pleasant.

FYI, UM library's can provide digital copies of items in its physical collection
You know how you sometimes look for a source on the library site but they only have a physical copy that you'd have to go and pick up in-person? Well it turns out that they can actually scan its physical copies of books, journals, etc, upon request and then either upload a digital copy to Hathitrust or send you a PDF directly.

Link: [https://www.lib.umich.edu/find-borrow-request/request-digital-copies-or-duplication](https://www.lib.umich.edu/find-borrow-request/request-digital-copies-or-duplication)

Also, I want to give a shoutout to the library staff. The site says to expect a turnaround of 3-7 days, but they've always sent me the scans within a day or so, and usually within a few hours of submitting the request.

Since we're coming up on finals and term papers and whatnot, and since a lot of people rn don't even have the option of going to UM's libraries, I just wanted to tell people that this is an option, in case anyone didn't already know. Hopefully, someone finds this information useful.

Css profile
Hello, I unfortunately was unable to transfer in myself but my girlfriend was just accepted to the taubman school of architecture as a transfer student. She missed the deadline for the css profile because she was unaware of it. She checked the homepage constantly and had filled out everything she was told to but the css profile was never once mentioned to her in emails or as a to do item on her profile. It was not until after she received her acceptance letter on April 1st that she had even heard of the css profile. I know that it is listed in some places on the school website because we found it after hearing about it, but now she is forced to file an appeal. How likely is the appeal process to work and is there anything she or I can do to better her chances to receive the aid she needs? She and I do not come from much and without aid from the University it will be incredibly difficult to afford the tuition. She doesn't know about this post. Thanks for your time and any responses I get.

Transfer Student Stigma
Hi everyone!

I’ve recently accepted admission to LSA and will be moving in during this Fall. 

I’m sure this is me being extremely paranoid and anxious to attend, but is there some sort of stigma against transfer students? More specifically, is there the mindset that, “oh you didn’t get in as a freshman, wow you don’t belong here” etc. As I’m writing this out, I feel like this is just a really stupid thing to be asking, but I can’t help but wonder if that sort of thing exists. 

Appreciate any opinions/responses/tips and honesty!

Anyone in need of MCAT tutoring?
I’m a senior graduating this May. I’m also a 100th percentile MCAT scorer looking to take on a couple students for tutoring. While Covid complicates things, I’d be willing to meet in person (with precautions) or virtually. Rates are negotiable, especially for those in need. (If you demonstrate need I will substantially discount my rates). Please let me know if you or anyone you know are interested by sending a DM my way. 

Please note: initial consultations are free of charge!

Good luck with finals everyone!

Snow Concerns
do you ever have to shovel snow just to go to class in the winter or is the snow already plowed for you? basically, does the snow get in the way of day-to-day life during winter? because my mom is convinced that it will & she wants me to choose another school instead for her own selfish reasons, but personally i would rather commit to umich despite the weather bc i’m sure it’s not as bad as she’s making it out to be

umich students: would you say that the snow makes your college life more difficult or is it really nbd?

I’m about to commit to UM this week as an upcoming freshman and I feel so overwhelmed and scared.
I’m so scared of how big of a change it is going to. I’ve been crying everyday for four days just thinking about how much i’ll miss my family. I was really excited when I got accepted but my excitement has died down over the past few months and especially the past week because of my anxiety and my friends all committing to other schools. Most of my friends are going to MSU or OU so i won’t really have any friends coming into UM which is only adding to my stress. Being more on the introverted side is only increasing my anxiety about attending UM and it’s large campus :/ on top of that i’ve been hearing all sorts of things about how hard UM is for premeds which is only adding to everything. I feel like its so stupid of me to let fear get in the way of pushing myself to attend UM and kick ass but i’m really doubting whether I should commit or not. Please comment things to make me feel better; whether it’s about your own experiences with dealing w/ anxiety or as a UM student,

tl;dr i’m a high school senior that is about to commit to UM but is scared to because it’s going to be a really big change and i won’t know anyone going into UM

What should I expect to change next semester, academics wise?
Rising sophomore here. I'm honestly chugging through the end of the semester, and worrying that next year's going to hit me like a brick. Maybe it's because I'm not a STEM major and/or I have lenient profs, but this year seemed much easier academically than what I was expecting. (Still stressful of course). Anyways, 

What are the biggest changes that you expect from a gradual transition back to in-person classes? 

Is it common to not have final exams/papers in intro courses?

What are you not looking forward to about in-person? (Besides having to wake up ;) )

Getting football tickets off of the waitlist? Is this a lost cause?
Hello! I am a current freshman and stupidly missed the deadline to buy student tickets for next football season.

Are the SAP requirements by semester, year, or overall?
I ask because I will have 14 attempted (and passed) credits from Fall, but 15 attempted with 7 W and 8 D this semester. If I don't get a D in those 8 credits, I know I'm screwed and will have to try to appeal SAP. But, if I do get a D in those 8 credits, I'll be over the 67% threshold for the year - but not for the winter semester. Which of these is what matters? Would a D in those 8 credits save me from SAP problems? 

I've asked Financial Aid about this and they've been very unclear, though I plan to schedule a real meeting with them ASAP.

I know the wait for anybody through Michigan Medicine is going to be forever. Does anyone know anybody outside of the health system that has been good in your experience?

Info: Not a student @Umich, just in A2 and going off to a college OOS in the fall, just seeing if anybody had info here while I am still in A2!

How do I know if my GPA is a good one?
Are there statistics available somewhere for the distribution of GPA scores for LSA students/graduates? Do I have to ask someone if I want to know that data for specific majors within LSA? Who would that be? (and by GPA, I mean college, not HS GPA)

Campus Visit for Prospective Student
Hi, I know that there aren't any campus tours being offered right now, but is campus open to walk around to check out? There was a self guided driving tour on the website, so I would assume so, but I just wanted to make sure there isn't like a strict students only policy or something right now, thanks!

What does P/NRC do to your GPA?
I'm a little confused on the impact of a P/NRC grade on GPA calculations.

Say I have the following semester grades (as an example, really wish I did though):

* A
* A
* A
* B

If I chose to convert the B to a P/NRC grade (P), will my semester GPA be 4.0?

Getting the second dose somewhere else?
Hello, I just scheduled my first dose for later this week, but they won’t tell me which vaccine I’m getting until the day of. As someone who is going back home at the end of the month, I was wondering if I’m able to get my first dose on campus and the second back home. I know the university website says no, but has anyone asked and succeeded?

Also for those who’s already vaccinated, did they tell you which vaccine you’re getting at the vaccination site or through the website in the morning?
--------------------------------------------------
Transferring to Ann Arbor
I currently go to a terrible CS school (ranked like 150th in the US) and really hate the quality of the curriculum. It is essentially very time-consuming with a lot of tasteless busy work. For example, we are never told to write test cases for our software, graded for them, or even have our software tested against edge cases. I try my best to test my software well and make sure it is as good as possible, yet other students just hand in broken software and we all end up getting 100's. 

I have the option to transfer to Ann Arbor. The issue is, I don't live in Michigan so I will have to pay out-of-state tuition. I would also graduate a semester late. After calculating the cost from the very little fin-aid I get, the difference between the two degrees (counting the money I lose from the extra semester I'm in school versus working full time at a company) is about $160K. My parents can afford it and don't mind paying the money (so I don't need to take any loans or pay them back) but obviously don't want me to pay a ridiculous amount of money on something where I won't make it back. 

I have interned and will continue to intern at a F500 company, and have a good chance of getting a return offer. So I will hopefully have some sort of job lined up if I stay at my current school. 

However, I hope to cover up all the holes in my knowledge (writing good test cases, learning how to deal with large codebases, etc) and work at a FAANG (doesn't everyone). Since I will be pushing back my graduation date and have already taken a lot of advanced (although poorly run) CS classes and already have internship experience, I think I will be a pretty competitive applicant for the higher-tier companies if I do transfer. Any advice on whether transferring is worth it?

Balancing classes and federal work study
Hey everyone! I was just recently admitted to the college of LSA & I intend on studying bio, health, and society on a pre-med track. I recently got my financial aid package and unfortunately have a lot of costs to cover out of pocket & I was offered $3,000 for a federal work study. I was just wondering if federal work studies are worth it, or if I'm better off getting taking out more loans and working a different job? Because if I do the work study I'll still have to work another job to keep up w personal expenses. I'm just scared that two jobs in addition to pre med will be really overwhelming, but I'm not sure what other choice I'll have. And given the possibility of medical school too many loans would definitely be inideal.

I'm first-gen and my mom doesn't really have an opinion on this, so I'm kinda on my own w/ this decision. It would be really appreciated if you guys could give your opinions or maybe your own experiences with similar situations? Thank you!

Cross campus transfer
Hi, a newly admitted student here. I have some questions about major/minor

***1.Is it possible to pursue a minor across different schools?***

For example, majoring in art and design at stamps but minoring in psych at LSA

***2. How challenging is it to transfer to LSA?***

I will be studying art and design, but If I end up with more interest in psych at LSA, is it possible to transfer to LSA? If it is possible, how challenging is it?
--------------------------------------------------
To All Prospective students, do not base your decisions or judgements off this year. It’s not a normal year!!!
Yes, this year has sucked. Yes Michigan has been completely online and very Covid conscious which has limited the enjoyment of this school year for many. And yes, many schools down South are way more open and “more fun.”  But do not take this into account. By all projections, this is a one off and we will be back to normal next year.  
I know it is hard to do, but tune out all of the noise and complaints about this year. Don’t ask the freshman whose only perspective is this year, ask the upper classmen who were here when basketball made it to the Championship, or for Winterfest. This school is a lot of fun in a normal year and do not let this year disqualify UofM. Have real conversations about what Michigan is normally all about, and then make the best decision for yourself. Go Blue

Residential College?
Hi, I just committed to Michigan, Go Blue! I've also been accepted to the residential college and I know that I would really appreciate the small vibe of RC in such a big school, I want to practice Mandarin, and east quad is nice. I've read other reddit threads about the RC, but here are my concerns:  


1. I'm taking AP Mandarin right now, and might get a 5? If I do, do I place out of the language requirement for LSA? If I don't how many semesters of language do I take at Michigan? Also, Mandarin is not an RC intensive course thingy, so would I just be chatting with other mandarin people at the language tables?
2. I'm a computer science major and really want to challenge myself with those courses and math and such. Would the RC requirement inhibit my STEM coursework?
3. Dumb question, but RC course requirements satisfy the LSA requirements right, so if I ever drop RC, those courses still counted towards my LSA degree right?
4. What are the disadvantages of RC if I'm not taking the intensive language class and the other RC requirements count towards LSA requirements. 

Thanks so much for the help!

Inquiry about Cognitive Science
I have been looking at the cognitive science major on the U-M website, and it is a discipline that has many branches. For those who major in CogSci, what is your experience like in terms of what you learn in the class, the rigor of the classes, and the kinds of internships that you do?

Can’t pick a major
In the process of transferring and can’t pick a damn major. I’m coming from a interdisciplinary program and I can’t seem to narrow down.

For career paths, I’m leaning towards business related, such as marketing and working in start-ups, but not sure. I want to graduate on time, and can’t pick between Econ (kind of interested), cogsci, comms, or psych. Could use some advice.

Clarification Questions for a future freshman
Hey! So like many others flooding this sub, I have a few questions as a prospective student. 

About me: I’ve committed to engineering, and I want to go into biomedical engineering (not sure mechanical side like surgical tech/prosthetics or something like tissue therapy yet, but I guess I have time)

1) MLCs- I’m interested in HSSP and MRAD. I was wondering what their acceptance rates were for regular decision (I heard 20%?). I was also wondering what their hour commitments were. I heard it’s a meeting on the weekend and another during the week? Because I am really anxious, having a community on the first day would be so helpful. I really want to get into one. I was wondering what the two MLCs specifically look for in students. 

2) Humanities requirements - I heard you need a total of 16 credit hours of humanities to graduate. Can you apply AP credits for these? Like APUSH and AP LIT? Or do you need to take 16 credit hours AT UMich? (Lol I wanna get out of taking the LIT test this year) If I need to take the humanities classes at UMich, do you have any suggestions for easy ir interesting classes? 

3) clubs/research - I know umich has amazing engineering clubs like the solar car team, Baja, and spark.  I’ve heard that sponsors hire from these teams, and that job prospects wise, these clubs are better than research. Most of these clubs seem very mechanically focused. Are there any clubs like these for biomedical engineering? 

4) Financial Aid - I’m not expecting any from UMich, but I applied for aid and haven’t received any notification of how much my cost of attendance would be. I was accepted early in February :). Should I reach out? 

5) Roommates- alright last question. I promise!<3 I’ve heard conflicting things about how roommates are chosen? Some say there’s a form the university has you fill out before you get matched, and others say there is no form this year at all. Which is true? Also, where do we find all the housing application stuff? 

A MASSIVE thank you! I’m really excited to attend in the fall and having these questions answered would clear so much up. Anyway, go blue 〽️〽️!!

Michigan Aerospace Science Association. Really Impressive
I just got accepted into the University of Michigan Ann-Harbor College of Engineering last wek. One of the reasons why I applied to this school is because of the Aerospace Engineering opportunities that exist. The tangerine space machine by the Michigan Aerospace Ascience Association looks really sleek(or "dope" colloquially).

The specs are pretty good though.

&#x200B;

[specs](https://preview.redd.it/ltwbj8oyams61.png?width=522&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3c8cbb1003e80f436af5195f948f293629f08b4)

Does anyone know what the specific impulse of this is? Just curious. I mean, there's probably a way to calculate it based on this info but I'm too lazy right now.

Anyways. I have confidence that our school will win the $1M prize. Go Wolverines!

Rush Process at Michigan Question
So I’m going to be a freshman next year on campus and I am interested in rushing both a social and a professional (business) fraternity. From what I understand you shouldn’t rush 2 at the same time, but I am wondering if there is both a fall and a spring rush for both social and professional fraternities?? I’ve heard that there is no official fall rush for social ones and am wondering if this applies to business ones as well? Any help would be appreciated.

Fellow School of Education admits?

--------------------------------------------------
I'm overwhelmed.
I've decided to attend the University of Michigan for this fall semester. I made my deposit and I'm getting more and more information about financial aid, housing, mcards, etc. And I have to say I am overwhelmed with the information I have to parse. I live in South Korea. I don't have any resources or people I can consult and get answers to.

There is just too much stuff I need to learn and doing it abroad is not helping.

"Ok, to get housing applications I need an Mcard.... what's and mcard,, oh a student card thingy.. it also works as a check card? Lets check the FAQ... the hell is a blue bucks.. wait, does the basic meal plan that is included with the housing application cover all three meals? are there other meal plans?"

Is there someplace I can chat and ask questions to UofM students or staff? Like a Discord or Element community. Or maybe even Telegram or What's app. I don't have a Facebook account so that's out of the water.

Good apartments preferably near North Campus
Hi everyone, I am an incoming master's student in ECE. I was an undergrad at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and have been living in an apartment for the past year. I'm sure a lot of students choose to live in apartments, so I was wondering what good apartments are near the north campus near the engineering school? Also are there subreddits that have more such information?
--------------------------------------------------
Incoming CoE Freshman Questions about WISE, MRADS, UROP, and project/build teams
Hey, everyone! This is my first reddit post so I’m sorry if the tone of this comes off as a little weird for reddit or if this is super long, I’ve got major issues with writing too much lol. I’ll put a TLDR at the end of the post.

I committed to the College of Engineering a few weeks ago and have seen a lot of differing opinion about these topics on the subreddit, so I wanted to ask about them in my own context to see if that changes anything.

For a little info on me if it helps, I’m a girl currently debating on Mechanical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, or Data Science for a major and definitely want hands on type experience in some things before declaring anything. I can be pretty social if I feel like I need to be and generally get along well with the people I meet unless they’re jerks or something.

I love French and plan on doing a minor and a study/internship abroad at some point, but I’m pushing for one of the summer programs so it doesn’t really affect anything else I might be doing.

The plan as of rn is to apply to MRADS and WISE RP. If I do MRADS, that’s pretty much it including a club or two, but if I join WISE, I’ll also either apply for UROP or join a project/build team depending on the feedback I get here. I would do MRADS/UROP as work-study if I do them, but project teams seem interesting, too.

I really like the idea of supporting/being supported by a group of women in STEM, but I’m not sure how I feel about fully female halls in housing even though I know Mojo is still a coed building. I like constantly being surrounded by all different types of people, and I’m not sure how different it feels living in one of those halls instead of a coed like I would get with MRADS. I also saw some people say that UROP is kind of shit compared to MRADS because there’s more busy work and less community, but tell me if I’m wrong about that at all and if they’re completely comparable besides the living situation.

How are the meetings and required classes for WISE, MRADS, and UROP? Are any of them so boring or annoying that you would advise someone not to join that community?

I’ve seen the websites for Solar Car, MASA, and some other teams, and I wanted to know what the time commitment generally was for someone who’s pretty involved in a team or for someone like me who would probably do some small random work for at least the first semester considering my lack of experience. Is the time about the same as a research commitment, or would I also be able to do it with 6-9 hr/week research? Any opinions on the teams themselves, preferences on any teams, or even advice on whether or not I should jump straight in as a freshman instead of trying to do research would be helpful. If I don’t join one as a freshman, I would still try to be in a project team during sophomore, junior, and/or senior year.

Last question is kinda random, but I saw on the housing website that a bunch of buildings have a “community kitchen,” but I can’t find anything about what that even means LMAO. Does that just mean the Mojo dining hall has a microwave and refrigerator for people to use when they need, or is it a whole kitchen that we can cook in if we have our own equipment when staff isn’t in there? Not like I would cook every day, or even every week if I’m busy, but it would be nice to know if that option was there if I wanted to use it. I love to cook, but wasn’t really expecting to get the opportunity until I moved off campus.

Tbh I know that this sounds like I want to do a lot, but I genuinely want to take advantage of/experience everything that’s available to me at umich, obv in a reasonable schedule and obv not actually everything since I probably wouldn’t have the time. My mom pretty much made me stay in and didn’t let me do much of anything in high school, so I really want to take the opportunity of this freedom to join what I want and run with it.

**Tl;dr :** I want some advice on whether I should join MRADS by itself, or WISE RP with UROP. If you’ve had the experience or know about it, is there a big difference btwn WISE halls and MRADS halls since they’re both in Mojo but WISE is all-female and MRADS is coed? Any huge differences btwn MRADS and UROP that you noticed besides housing? Is anything about any of the required courses or meetings in these communities super annoying or boring, or bad enough that you wouldn’t encourage joining? What’s your impression of the CoE project teams, and would you recommend any? How is the time commitment of a project time compared to doing research? Would you recommend joining a project team instead of doing research freshman year, or is it just as beneficial to join a team as a 2nd, 3rd, or 4th-year student?

Thanks to anyone who reads or replies since this is so long!! Really appreciate any and all help!!

UPDATE: Thanks again for all the feedback! I decided to change the priority on my MLC application to WISE RP first and MRADS second since the project teams seem like where I want to be and start out. I can always try something new as a sophomore if it doesn't work out, and research will definitely be there if I want it. Can't wait to start my freshman year! Go Blue!

Help with a digital library resource?
Edit: Someone has helped me out with getting access to this journal, thanks guys!!

Hey guys,

Sorry if this type of post is not allowed. I'm doing some genealogical research and found that there is an obituary for one of my ancestors in some old Gas Industry journal. Unfortunately, while the full text is searchable (I found it through Google Books), it is only digitally available from the University of Michigan library, and I'm not a student/alum. Links bring me in circles, I can only find it here:

[https://search.lib.umich.edu/catalog?query=isn%3A06385198&library=All+libraries](https://search.lib.umich.edu/catalog?query=isn%3A06385198&library=All+libraries)

which has a link to a HathiTrust pdf of the journal/obituary that I can't access. It is 'v.97-98 1907 Jan-Jun'. I'm super curious about the obit since I can see part of it and wonder what the rest says. Does anyone know a way for me to access library resources as a non-student? I have had no luck so far.

Thanks!

Looking for off campus apartment housemate for 21-22 year
I’m not sure where I should post this or if there’s a megathread or groupme or something.

I would like a housemate to split the cost with. I have found two 2 bedroom 1 bath apartments about half a mile from campus, each about $1300 per month. So about $650 each.

I will be a sophomore in the fall. My major interests are pure mathematics, computer science, and german. (Obviously undecided as of now) I like to work on cs projects with others, so that would be fun.

I am sort of introverted and I do not drink. I like quiet, but I’m okay with having a couple of friends over as long as it’s nothing crazy.

I do not smoke and I am quite hygenic.

Pm me if you’re interested

Funding masters with no financial aid? (international student)
I got an offer of admission in masters for engineering of a field I want to shift into, but I currently can't think of any way to pay for it except for a massive loan of $75k/ year (from budget estimate in umich website).  They stated that masters won't offer financial aid so I can give up on that, and I tried to look at other options but most are only for US citizens.  I'm willing to work part time, but I think the positions that waive tuition like TA/RA are very limited for masters and not a chance I can rely on, and I don't know how much other part time jobs can offset my expenses.  

I don't want to give up yet and I'm currently looking for other methods.  Would you have any ideas, suggestions, or resources I can look at that will help in my situation?

Our graduate student co-op has openings! We're on the southeast side of the University of Michigan campus, and **we're looking for new housemates starting Summer/Fall 2021.** We strongly prefer longer term residents (2+ years). 

**What you'll get at our co-op:** • Communal living with UMich grad students from all disciplines • A quiet neighborhood on the SE side of town, close to the Arboretum, \~1 mile from the heart of Central Campus. • All utilities included in a very competitive rent  • In-house laundry, street parking.• A pantry stocked with staples such as grains and spices• Your own room with most basic furnishings provided• Fun and community!

**What you'll give:** You'll be expected to work. Everyone contributes their time and talents towards their individual house jobs, and we all work together on improving and maintaining the house. If you’re someone who sees a project and takes the initiative to fix it, you’d be a great fit.

You're also probably a good fit if you are interested in living in community (and all that entails), if you're handy with tools, like learning new skills, and can work hard. We like the NYT crossword, sustainability, gardening, political engagement, eating good food, drinking good beer, documentary movie nights, and having fun!

Send us an email with a little about yourself. We’re looking forward to hearing from you!

Eecs 183
Do people receive honors codes for eecs 183. Seems like such an easy intro class with similar code that everyone’s code is similar. Would this MOSS cheat detector only raise suspicion if the similarity score was about 60%? I’m just wondering, because me and my friend were looking at out old eecs 183 codes and it was very similar and we were shocked to see that. I’m in eecs 280 right now, and I am now scared I’ll be wrongly honor coded because someone’s code is similar to mine

DS+stats major or DS+math minor
How is math minor at umich? If I am now a DS, will adding a stats major or math minor be beneficial? Any advice?
Thanks

UHS/UMHS billing
I went into UHS a couple weeks ago for some blood work that was sent over to the university’s hospital. I just got the bill for that lab work and it was a whopping $700. My insurance took out about $500 dollars but it’s making me question what I’m paying for for each test. Since I didn’t go through the hospital directly I shouldn’t be getting charged for wasting their space or having my blood drawn there. Does anyone have any experience with something like this or negotiating prices to make it cheaper?

advice on using AP credits
I was wondering if it would be beneficial to me to use the AP credits to skip classes and start with more advanced level classes or just not use the credits to somewhat refresh myself on the material.

The current credits I have are: Bio (5), Psych (5), Phys 1,2 (5), Stats (5), Calc AB (5)

The credits I anticipate to get this year are: Chem, Calc BC, Lit, Lang

I'm kinda worried if I'll get screwed over by the higher level courses if I skip the introductory courses with my AP credits, so any advice is welcome!

BSI Transfer: Minor Questions
 Hi there!

I recently got accepted into Michigan’s School of Information BSI program (UX path) as a transfer student and I’m extremely excited about it! However, I do have a couple of questions I am hoping current students could give me some insight on!

The first question I have is minors. At my current university, I am a psy and marketing minor, however, I noticed psy isn’t a minor, and my friends who currently go to Michigan told me I missed the application cut off to apply for a minor at Ross? I’m currently looking at minoring in art at STAMPS, but I’m unsure about it. I was wondering if anyone could give me any suggestions on minors that would complement my UX design major.

My second question is if anyone else who has transferred into the BSI program has found time to complete a minor, or if they would recommend I just stick with focusing on my major.

I’ve been talking to my parents about adding a minor and they are extremely worried for me. The current university I go to is barely a top 200 university and they are worried BSI’s workload will be too much for me to add a minor. I’m hoping there are a couple of BSI transfers or just BSI students in general that could give me some insight!

Thanks!

Engineering/CS Free Time & Study Time During The Week
Hey U of M engineering/computer science students, I'd like to hear an estimate on how many hours per week you study (I'm aware this can be variable) and how much free time you have? Would the amount of free time you have be enough to, say, work on a startup?

Thanks!

Why can't roomates site together in campus buildings?
Mostly title. If i want to study with my roomate on campus, to take a break from the same house iv been in every day, why can't we sit together? There have been tons of times where this literally puts one of us closer to someone else which is more of a covid risk. We've tried to explain this to building staff, but told its just the rule.

Feeling like I’m not smart enough for UofM
This is a little vent , I’m currently a junior going to be a senior in the fall semester . Ever since I transferred to UofM I  feel like a failure . My current major is statistics /data science and I’m struggling so much . I’ve completed most of the classes and only have  4th year upper level statistics classes . I feel like I’m not smart enough for the classes , when I was in a different school I thought I was good at maths cause I normally did very well in the calculus class and other pre reqs. However , now that I’m at UofM , everything feels like such a struggle , I keep retaking my classes . I know I have like 35 credits left to graduate , but I honestly just feel so unmotivated and dumb . Any advice would be appreciated.

Neighbor at Northwood IV called police on my partner
Yesterday afternoon I heard a knock on my door. My partner was puttering in the kitchen while listening to music on his headphones, so I answered. Before me stood a cop and two security guards. The first thing I noticed was the gun in the holster, and honestly my heart just sank because this didn't look like good news. They asked if my partner was home and when I asked what's this about they reiterated they could only talk to my partner. So my partner, who was like 2 feet away, comes to the door. Then they inform him that a neighbor filed a report that my partner was stalking the neighbor and asked him if it were true. Both my partner and I were absolutely shocked and looked at each other like we were just struck by lightning. Apparently, my partner was outside in the courtyard in front of our apartment like an hour before this, listening to a podcast and enjoying sunshine. He then went to check the mail, but vaguely noticed that someone was checking their mail so he walked back to wait for that person to leave since he didn't have his mask on. Once the person left, he checked the mail, and went on his happy way around the block. 

Apparently this person called the police because a) my partner didn't have a mask on while socially distancing outside b) he thought my partner was stalking him????????

We informed the police that we've been living in our place 3 years, we always practice social distancing and my partner always wears a mask in crowded places where it's impossible to socially distance. And the cop was like, well ok. Then I asked who the neighbor was, and he said he couldn't tell us. 

When I asked my partner if he noticed what the neighbor at the mailbox looked like he couldn't even begin to describe this person because he literally didn't look at him. 

Like wtf. Been living here for three years. I go and do community testing every week even though I'm never on campus. I follow the rules. I'm friendly to my neighbors. I break down my recycling. And BAM! No apologies. Nothing. 

Best part? I get an email from university housing administrator who says she wants to set up a meeting to discuss the incident with my partner regarding the mask mandate on campus. 

I am about to graduate and move but damn what a way to go. 

TL;DL Some paranoid neighbor called cops on my partner because he didn't recognize him as one of the residents.

Undergrad Laptop Program
Hey, I was taking a look at the ULP program and I had some questions.

Is the laptop program only for in state students or is it for everyone?

Also when do freshman usually get emailed about getting a laptop?

Financial Aid Transfer Student
Hey everyone.  I'm a student who transferred from a community college with 60 credits. I was at my previous in-state community college for 3 years (changing majors and working at the same time). I've completed two semesters at Umich so far and both were only made possible due to the Go Blue Guarantee and other grants. Next year I will be a senior, but I'm worried that I won't qualify for aid (either the Go Blue Guarantee or other school grants) because it will technically be my 5th year in school. Anyone have any experience with this situation?
