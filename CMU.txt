Is Triple Counting a class allowed
Can one get credit for a class in her major and in 2 minors at the same time. The wording seems to imply this is allowed but it is not explicit.
--------------------------------------------------
How often do people take on off-cycle internships?
Title. Wondering how feasible / useful this would be, potentially delaying a year to graduate and missing out on class bonding (is this a thing???) but also gaining more experience before applying for full time roles. Or is it generally considered better/ more standard to front-load relevant courses and get referred from friends/upperclassmen/alums? Not entirely sure how the tech pipeline works at CMU.

Would appreciate any first/second-hand experiences!
--------------------------------------------------
chem majors???
i got accepted into mcs but i never see any chem majors on here or really any mcs students talk much about their experiences on here (maybe bc they’re piled up with hw) but can anyone speak on their experiences as a student in mcs? how’s the workload, professors, job prospects, etc

\- Professors that are kind and want to help you

\- A kind student base that supports each other and lots of opportunities to socialize

\- More project-based classes

\- Prestige

\-  Nice dorms and good food

Any advice would be appreciated!

Summer classes outside CMU

I wanted to know if anyone from the Bay Area has ever taken summer classes for breadth/university core credits at a community college/CSU. If so, any recs would be greatly appreciated, since its kind of hard finding ones that match up with CMU classes. I'd prefer Unis/colleges in the bay, but anywhere in Cali is fine as long as they can be taken for transferrable credits.

CMU MSRD/MSR Admission
I am currently a 4th year Mechanical Engineering student from IIT Delhi. In the last 3 years I did a few projects in the field of Aerial Robotics, 1 Summer Research Internship and 1 Industry Internship at a startup. In most of them, I worked mostly with Mechanical stuff like Design, Prototype and Testing. I also have the knowledge of ROS, Basic PCB designing, Python/OpenCV...
My BTech Project is on Autonomous Ground Robots(Due to Covid, I only worked in the simulation). I also did multiple electives in Entrepreneurship and Management. But, I have a really bad CGPA of 6.7/10.

I will graduate by May 30th, 2021. I am planning to work under my professor for 1 year at IIT Delhi in the field of Robotics. 

How good are the chances for me to get into the programs like CMU MSRD/MSR?

Given, 
1. CGPA - 6.7/10
2. Good amount of research during my Undergraduate Program
3. 1 year of research experience under my professor


Also, kindly please suggest more programs in the field of Robotics that fits my profile.

My interests:
1. Aerial/Ground Robots
2. Vision/Perception
3. Learning Robots

I also want to build applications of "tech like neuralink" to make exoskeletons for improving human life...

Devon Towers Apartment Experience
Hey guys, so I'm planning to move into Devon Towers this coming fall into a 3B 2B apartment. It's at a great location and seems very cost-friendly as well. Is there anyone here who could tell me their past experience with the apartment, if you've happened to stay at the place?

It's located at 4920 Centre Ave.
--------------------------------------------------
Pass fail or C
Just wondering with the extra voucher that you can use to convert a class to pass fail after the deadline, would it be worth it to use it with a class I’m likely going to get a C in? For reference the class is not a prerequisite for any further classes I intend to take and would lower my qpa if I remained with a C rather than a Pass.
--------------------------------------------------
Taking Physics 2 at CMU vs. Pitt
Next semester I’m supposed to take concepts, 112, and physics 2 all at once. Is it a manageable workload? A lot of people have been advising me not to take all 3 at once and to take physics 2 over the summer at pitt. However, I am not sure if it would be much easier or smarter to take physics 2 at pitt. Also, I am an ECE major so I’m wondering if it would be more beneficial to take physics 2 at cmu.
--------------------------------------------------
Grad courses I can take as a ChemE student?
I’m an incoming chemE masters student at CMU and was wondering how i can utilize the flexibility of choosing courses to the best. Are there any highly recommended courses for ChemEs or people with some interest in business management courses? I was thinking of taking some courses at Tepper but not sure what could be beneficial.

Is Fairfax a safe place to live?
Rising sophomore here. Just wanted to know if Fairfax was safe and if it was home to CMU students only? I heard someone say it was also home to other residences so if someone could shed light on Fairfax (besides what’s on the website) that would be great.

Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------
Is taking hard classes worth it?
Hello, naive high schooler here! In high school, we were always told to challenge ourselves and take hard classes to get into a good college. Does it matter if we take challenging courses in college? Does it help to get into graduate school or to get a job? I want to challenge myself in courses I'm interested in. I'd rather not take a hard course that I won't enjoy. 

I don't know how college works. Thanks!

MSAII Program
Hey guys, I am currently finishing up my sophomore year as a Computer Science major at SJSU. I am interested in pursuing my masters and especially in an Artificial Intelligence sector, and am really drawn to this program. 


Some questions:
1) how selective is the applications process?

2) how can I start prepping now to make my 
chances higher of getting selected? 

3) how many years is this program?

4) anyone who has finished this program and would like to share their experience? 

5) any other tips?

Appreciate any help, advice, tips :)

is cmu socially dead
I've read this online (as someone wondering whether to attend CMU for undergrad) and was wondering what those of you with in-person experience think. I know the social life is not as diverse as at Berkeley for example, but how does it compare in general?
--------------------------------------------------
Roommate group?
Hi guys I know this is really late but I got a really bad time slot for housing as a rising junior. I'm female and was planning on going into general selection alone but now that almost all of the semi-suite options are taken, there aren't many options left.

Does one other person want to apply for a single with me in a suite in Highland Apartments?

Or is there any group I can join for Resnik/WW (I think 4 or 5 people are needed). If not does anyone want to form a group with me for a suite in Resnik/WW (combination doubles/singles)?

Thanks guys :)

I got bored and decided to rank all my classes at CMU. Here are the results
I ranked most of the classes I took at CMU. Some similar classes are combined and some nontraditional classes (such as seminar and undergraduate research) are removed. Dropped classes are not included (or else perception would be in the bottom 3).

50.Bioorganic Chemistry Laboratory

Report 1: 1200 pipettes. Report 2:  1200 pipettes (but in a well plate). Report 3: cut your hand since we had the wrong glassware. Report 4: No reaction. Report 5: report 2 again. Reports 6-8 and the presentation: ?. Classes this bad should not be permitted.

49.Mathematical Methods in Chemistry

"You can just assume that we didn't learn anything in math methods".

48.Seminar for Supplemental Instruction

I wish this could be lower. It had excessive busy work, made me sign a contract without the details of the position, and worst of all, made me finish CMU with a decimal number of units.

47.Topics of Law: Introduction to Intellectual Property Law

Taught by probably the rudest people at CMU. At least it is very very easy.

46.Student Teaching Practicum

I forgot I even took this class.

45.Physics I for Science Students

Why couldn't the crouching lioness come and tell the professor to make sure he taught the material before the test.

44.Computing at Carnegie Mellon

Does anyone else still play the phishing game? I wonder if the proctoring software is still stealing my data.

43.Concepts of Mathematics

Why did I take this, it's not even required. At least the professor was pretty nice.

42.Physical Chemistry (Thermo): Macroscopic Principles of Physical Chemistry

At least the professor warned us the class would be boring.

41.Survey of Western Music History/Repetoire and Listening

I'm sad this class was this low, the professor is very nice. Unfortunately, not much was really covered.

40.Neuroscience and Psychology of Everyday Life

Apparently you don't have to take two freshman seminars.

39.Physics II for Biological Sciences and Chemistry Students

Pretty generic, I'm still not quite sure what is covered by this class even after TAing for it twice.

38.Systems Neuroscience

Good material, but the mandatory quizzes due at 9:05 AM were very annoying.

37.Writing About Sports and Culture

I don't really like sports, so I'm not sure why I took it. Still a good class.

36.Revolutions of Circularity

A point is that of which there is no part. It was good for a freshman seminar.

35.Physical Chemistry (Quantum): Microscopic Principles of Physical Chemistry

Class is too hard, nerf now.

34.Modern Analytical Instrumentation

WHISPERING GALLERY MODES (is it yelling gallery modes if it's all caps?)

33.Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science

If you ever take this class, do a game for the final project. You will get a much higher score.

32.Laboratory II: Organic Synthesis and Analysis

Professor: "Note color change". Me: "Clear -> Yellow -> Black". Professor: "-2 you weren't supposed to say yellow."

31.Laboratory I: Introduction to Chemical Analysis

I do regret forgetting to fill out the form for group assignments. I was with random people I didn't know for most of the class.

30.Cognitive Psychology

If only this class did not meet at 8:30. If only we knew anything definitively in psychology and not just a lot of competing theories.

29.Genetics

iClickers should probably not be allowed for extra credit. Good thing I got one for free.

28.Advanced Systems Neuroscience

I needed 3 extra units for a minor, so why not take a class that is almost the same as a previous one.

27.Inorganic Chemistry

When the professor starts speaking German in class and doesn't realize.

26.Honors Chemistry

The TA might have gotten in trouble for telling us the answers to the tests. Averages probably shouldn't be 98.

25.Laboratory IV: Molecular Spectroscopy and Dynamics

Mathematica/Ampac/Agui/Avogadro/Gaussian/… has encountered an error and shut down. Some data may be lost.

24.Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Development

The professor keeps giving me stickers and the class is interesting. Unfortunately, it meets at 8:20 AM.

23.Global Histories: British Empire

Entertaining professor, even with the high amount of readings and essays.

22.Special Topics in Organic Chemistry and Chemical Biology: Remote Automated Lab

commandcenter.exe has encountered an error and shut down. Some data may be lost. Fun fact, this class has the longest name of any class I have taken.

21.Biologic Foundations of Behavior

Fun class, but the professor forgot to pay me when I was the grader. It was only $50 or so, but I'm kind of salty.

20.Special Topics: Synthetic Biology

Similar to biosensors, but even more quizes and student presentations.

19.Advanced Organic Chemistry

Named Reaction #267 - Zincke Reaction. These assignments are ridiculous. Otherwise, a good class.

18.Honors Biochemistry

Who needs the haters, I liked this class, especially the first part. Unfortunately, I have forgotten the Krebs cycle since taking it.

17.Introduction to CNC Router/Woodworking/Laser Cutting/ Metal Jewelry

These classes are always fun, but they kept getting canceled. I'm surprised I've never injured myself in here.

16.Professional Communication Skills in Chemistry

Good professors and I liked the subject material of my presentation.

15.Hot Glass I/Introduction to Moretti

What other class do you get to use a glory hole in? (Yes, that is really what the furnace is called)

14.The Molecular Basis of Polymer Mechanics

Interesting material, nice professor, a cool lab experience. Cleaning out the Schlenck line is not fun though.

13.Cellular Neuroscience

I really took the neuroscience classes out of order, apparently this is not supposed to be the first one. I did get a lot out of it though.

12.Summer Directed Study: Scientific Proposals

This is barely a class since I was the only student, but I enjoyed writing the proposal.

11.Quantitative Cellular and Molecular Biology Laboratory

A good lab experience, but RIP to all the poor cells we killed since we didn't know what we were doing.

10.Honors Moden Biology

The most informative class of my first semester. It almost made me switch to biology (I'm glad I didn't).

9.Bioorganic Chemistry: Peptides, Proteins and Combinatorial Chemistry

We studied whatever the professor was interested in that week. Still a good class, but I know more about the Impossible Burger than I should.

8.Introduction to Biophysics

After taking this class, I learned how to go and find the "tasty amino acids". The professor is very entertaining.

7.Biochemistry of the Brain

Chemistry and Neuroscience, together at last. Don't forget to like and subscribe to the podcast we made for an assignment.

6.Special Topics: Biosensors

Very interesting subject. Would be higher if the quizzes weren't so time consuming.

5.Modern Organic Chemistry I

It was here that I knew I wanted to study chemistry. The professor is very helpful and nice. The pKa of an alcohol is 16.

4.Redistricting and Representation

Not very relevant to my major, but I liked the class. Maybe the professor will get a certain position (not sure if it's supposed to be public yet)

3.Modern Organic Chemistry II

Had some of the best professors at CMU. I wish I won the face mug in the class raffle though.

2.Bioorganic Chemistry: Nucleic Acids and Carbohydrates

The most relevant class to what I want to do in the future. The quizzes were unnecessarily difficult though.

1.Transition Metal Catalysis for Organic and Polymer Synthesis

Really interesting, really useful, and really well-taught. The professor's favorite molecule is arshole and I think about that sometimes.

0.Chemistry of Addiction

It made me feel like I could make a difference. (I accidentally messed up the numbering, so looks like this list is 0 indexed now).

What counts as SCS core curriculum in regards to double counting for robotics major
 The robotics major curriculum states "CS Majors are permitted to double count a maximum of five courses from  their Primary Major core curriculum towards the Additional Major in  Robotics." Maybe I'm an idiot but I can't find anywhere in the SCS curriculum where it defines the "core curriculum." The only classes labeled core are the 6 core classes, none of which seem to have anything to do with robotics.

Any photographers willing to take a few graduation shots on campus?
As the title says, since I’m graduating this semester, it’d be a shame not to take at least a few grad pics on campus.

If anybody is shooting graduation pics, let me know and I’ll be glad to book an appointment with you!

Edit: my mom would be upset if I didn’t get any pics of me *actually* on campus so this is definitely for her. Lol

Recommendations for summer courses? ECE rising sophomore
Hi,

I'm a current freshman, going sophomore next year. I'm not one of the titans that enroll here with loads of APs and classes skipped already, pretty much started at ground 0 and working my way up (took Calc 1 in the fall, physics 1, etc). Granted I do have 18 units of gen eds from AP Gov and AP English I dont need to worry about

I got into the ECE major since it was unrestricted, and I'm looking to spread my load out a little to help with lightening the amount of work I'll have to do in sophomore and junior year. Pretty much need to still complete all requirements right now.

Currently I'm looking at 21-127 in summer 2, but as I hear its a semester's amount of work in half the time or so, though that will likely apply to all summer classes anyways.

carnegie mellon or northeastern for ece?
hi guys! i was recently accepted into carnegie mellon and northeastern for electrical and computer enigneering. i only got the chance to visit northeastern a year ago and i really liked boston, but i haven't gotten the chance to visit carnegie mellon. i'm not entirely sure if i want to pursue ece but as of right now, it is the major i am looking to do. i was wondering if anyone could give me advice on both of the schools?

Questions about CMU social scene from a prospective student
Hello! I am currently a junior in high school and I am very interested in CMU. I am wondering what the social scene is like there? I'm wondering because from what people have posted online, it seems like CMU students just study, even during weekend nights. Is that true? While I am definetley not a huge partier, it would be nice if they existed. Do they? Are there parties every day on the weekends? Frat parties? Thank you!

--------------------------------------------------
Questions from a prospective student
I am currently in high school and had some questions about the school

1. If I decide engineering is not for me would I still have good options in other fields if I change majors?
2. Will the engineering coursework be too hard if I don’t have any previous engineering knowledge?
3. Do engineering students hangout with people with other majors?
4. I am really interested in the arts and STEM, I wanna know how the balance is there?
5. How bad is stress culture and how hard is it to adjust to the difficult level of the classes for engineering?
6. I want to know if the environment is more friendly and collaborative or competitive, especially in engineering?
7. What is the social scene/Greek life like there?
--------------------------------------------------
Interesting Academic Electives?
I'm required to take an academic elective next semester (I'm not sure if all majors have these, but for me this just means it has to be a lecture-based course rather than a studio class). Does anyone have suggestions on classes/professors they took as that they particularly enjoyed?

parent meetings?
bit of backstory: my mental health has taken quite a hit this semester, and it's gotten to the point where i've had to talk to my advisor about it. but i haven't told my my parents anything yet, because i don't want them worrying unnecessarily about me.

i found out today that someone named catherine copetas from the scs dean's office is going to be meeting with my parents soon (i think it's an annual thing for donors), and i was wondering if anyone knows anything about what she usually talks about during these meetings?

i've been scared to death that she'll pass on what i've talked about with my advisor, even though i haven't signed the forms to disclose any of my information from school.

i know this is a really niche question, but i'm hoping someone has some info :(
--------------------------------------------------
Where can I find old schedules of classes?
Like the Fall 2019 schedule of classes? I can’t find anything :(
--------------------------------------------------
Upperclass housing
I'm working on figuring out where I want to live next year cause room selection is this week but I don't know much about any of the upperclass dorms. I know I can find stuff on the website but does anyone have advice about which are nice or which to avoid or just information in general? Really I just have to know which don't have bugs lol. I'm looking to be in an apartment.
--------------------------------------------------
Just curious has anyone gotten off the waitlist yet?

--------------------------------------------------
I don't have anything lined up for this summer
I was too depressed (like actually dysfunctionally depressed) during fall to apply for internships and I don't want to spend money on summer classes again after two summers of doing summer classes, I'm also far enough my course path that none of the offered summer courses are very useful to my graduation. I tried looking for summer research this semester but I was too late so that was a bust. I feel sick and insane.
--------------------------------------------------
Are intro courses truly introductory at CMU?
Hi! Most of the math and science classes I was able to take in high school were regular level (non-AP, non-honors). One of my biggest concerns about committing to CMU is the fear that I'll be starting out "behind" all of my peers. Am I expected to go into any intro classes with substantial prior knowledge in chem, bio, calc, or physics? (For reference, I would likely be majoring in ChemE and biomedical engineering.)
--------------------------------------------------
WOW

--------------------------------------------------
Can I transfer to IS from MCS
I’m an incoming freshman and I got in as a physics major at MCS, however I’ve realized I’m more interested in tech and IS seems like a great major for me. How difficult would it be transfer? I know cmu has a policy stating that I have to stay in my home college for the first semester, so I’m trying to transfer in the second

Need a baseball cap / hat from CMU people in Memphis, TN
So my school typically does a college day where seniors will take a group picture with a hat from the school they will be attending. However, I committed to CMU relatively late and my lazy self totally forgot about this event, and now Amazon ships CMU hats past the photo deadline.

&#x200B;

I was wondering if anyone was willing to lend / sell me a CMU hat and willing to meet up in Memphis. Any help is greatly appreciated.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I was able to find one (POGGERS). Thanks for the help guys!
--------------------------------------------------
Summer Courses + Grad School
I had a quick question about courses at CMU. Does the university allow students to take their classes over the summer? I want to look into this possibility to make tuition more affordable. If it does, will it cost extra?

Also, do I need to apply to do the CS grad school if I am already a CS undergrad? I'm considering doing the 5-year undergrad+masters program. I don't want to take the GRE though.

Thank you!
--------------------------------------------------
confused about AP credits at CMU
hi! I'm probably committing here soon so I've been combing through the [pdf](https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/docs/ap-credit.pdf) of AP credits and my GE requirements at SCS, just kind of confused why some of the course awards/equivalencies are just the name of the AP class repeated.

for example a 5 on AP biology says it counts toward "03-110, AP 5 Biology and complete the CMU attainment exam." is this even referring to a specific class? I couldn't find 03-110 anywhere and I really just want to know if it could by chance count toward 1 of my 4 science/eng GEs (even though its not explicitly listed on the SCS GE page). it's a similar situation with other courses like AP Lit & AP Euro

just wanted some clarification. also because if bio counts I wouldn't have to study for my AP chem test lol.

unrestricted engineering...?
hi!! so i was admitted to cmu and am SOO close to admitting! i was admitted into the college of engineering and my letter says "If you enroll in the College of Engineering, you will have the opportunity to select a major from the departments of Chemical Engineering, Civil & Environmental Engineering, **Electrical & Computer Engineering,** Mechanical Engineering or Materials Science & Engineering, as well as ..." I did some snooping around and it seems like people get different letters based on if they're admitted into the the ECE department or not. I want to declare the ECE major instead of the chemE major because it seems cool. Is this possible? Am I restricted from declaring ECE? Thank you so much!!! (sorry if this question is asked a lot).

Incoming PhD student tips
Hi everyone, I’ll be joining CMU as a grad student in the fall! I’m moving to Pittsburgh from Toronto, and I’ve never lived in the states before. 

Any tips that you have would be appreciated! Especially for international students moving to the city. I’ve also read grad student experiences and talked to a few students in the labs I’ll be joining, but I’d also appreciate some more specific CMU info, like social life, internships, cool things to do etc.

retaking 213 in the summer after failing this semester
213 is required, so I'd have to retake it anyway. Just wondering whether you all think it would be good to retake over the summer or just to take next fall since theres no fin aid for the summer sem? I don't have anything over the summer, but I've never taken a summer course before and wasn't sure if it would be tremendously more difficult or not.

I haven't technically failed 213 yet, but I'm projecting a high 60 for my final grade and a D won't cut it for me :( This was a disaster of a semester for me. I took too many core classes with 213 and ended up not being able to finish labs and doing horribly on the midterm. I was thinking of dropping a class for more time for 213, but for someone reason I didn't want to drop a class for the first time (idea was too disappointing or something at the time idk), and now will likely see all this effort go to waste and pretty much fail a class for the first time anyway.

**lesson here** (for me at least)**:** reach out to your advisors and professors for advice! They really do want to help. I just wished I did it MUCH earlier in the semester and not 1 month before the end of it.

I struggled with searching an internship the entire semester and finally got one in a startup. I was looking particularly for ML positions and I started getting calls from big companies around the end of March but couldn’t clear it because i am not very used to doing programming. 
First of all, i would need your advice because i have this summer to fix it up and do something bigger. Currently, i am totally unsatisfied with what i got. 
Secondly, why are our senior students who graduated act so unfamiliar to this situation? I mean its an uphill battle for international students here and then there were people who didn’t even bother to reply. Very few people did try to help and this is very disheartening. I thought tartan family will definitely help me and that’s what makes an institute better compared to others. “The Alumni Network”. How should i connect to our alumni on linkedin?

Details of the freshman housing options...
&#x200B;

[Hey guys as a fellow first year for the class of 2025 I have done some research on the housing options given to us. Hope you find it useful. ](https://preview.redd.it/1wm7jk5alyu61.jpg?width=2480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50a00e8f7f219c5caa8b06126134626409e60e30)

I've not included the following dorms as I don't think they would be popular options:

**Henderson House:** It's a themed living house meant for wellness and substance free living. Although I'm not against it, but yet it imo it would be a restricted environment and may be filled with some orthodox people. 

**Welch House:** Another themed living house meant for quite living. It would once again restrict the things you can do. Talking loudly isn't allowed, and it would be a little weird to stay silent and lessen your social activities all the time. 

**McGill and Scobell House:** It's all female and all male housing. Not a big fan of it. Since it's not co-ed, some people may even start doing weird things there. The college experience is quite dampened without interacting too much with the other gender. 

However if you feel any of these are meant for you it is absolutely fine. After all, each person has different needs and choices. 

Thanks!

Tepper Questions
1) what is the average gpa? What is achievable without going crazy? 

2) weekly workload on average? Heard SCS is 80 hours (including classes) yikes!!

3) what do people do for fun? 

4) What is the party and substance scene?

5) is Greek life big?

6) how quant is the curriculum? How many business classes do you take vs math and stuff?

Any pianist interested in a piano trio (during the summer)?
Hi!

My friend (cello) and I (violin) are looking for a piano player to play a piano trio with! We aren't majoring in music or anything, and are playing mostly for fun (I don't think there will be much performance opportunity anyway because of covid), so if anyone's interested in playing with us over the summer, dm me. Thanks\~

Cross-enrolling at CMU as a Pitt Student
I know it's really difficult to cross-enroll at CMU CS courses due to availability, but is there anyone who has been successful in doing so?

I was wondering when the best time is to even try to cross-register and what courses generally have more availability/which courses were you able to cross-register in successfully if you could?

CPT and SSN
I submitted my CPT request form quite late, and got little worried if I might run little late. How long did OIE took to process your CPT req (for the first time?) It says ten days but they always got everything later than ten days for me so far.

And did anyone get an SSN this semester? Are they taking in-person appointments? How long did it take for you?

Discord channel for incoming grad students
Someone made a discord channel for people coming to CMU this fall. It has people from multiple departments, and has various channels for majors, visa related stuff, housing, etc to hobby channels like reading, football, outdoors etc. Its a pretty cool channel with around 360 people as of now.

Research Team Not Responding
I’m kind of freaking out rn because I sent my resume to a research team for a research internship here and haven’t received a response back in almost a week after they said they will be in touch soon. On top of that, the same team sent my a google form to fill out and provide info, and they haven’t responded in almost a week as well. I don’t want to email them because I don’t want to seem like I’m nagging them but I really want to do their projects this summer since it’s been really hard to find stuff in data analysis and science. Any advice on how I should approach this situation?

MSPPM-DA loan related query.
Hello so I’m a fresh grad and recently got into the MSPPM-da track with a 50% scholarship. I’m an international student so was planning on taking a 60,000USD loan from prodigy. This would result in me making about 660USD payments per month for the next 15 years. 
My main concern is how bad is the job market? As an international student I’ve 3 months to find a job for my OPT to remain valid (if I’m wrong about this pls correct me). 3 months seems like an awfully short time to find a job and then start making my repayments of 660USD 6 months upon graduation. 
I get this question has no definite answer but I’m just looking for different thoughts/experiences people have and what’d they advise. 
My loan is independent of geography so I don’t have to be in the US to pay it. 
Thank you!!
--------------------------------------------------
Student discounts?
I’m an incoming masters student looking to purchase a macbook pro and/ or ipad pro and was wondering if CMU provides student discounts for apple products. 

It would also be helpful to know if CMU provides student discounts for any other services in food/ traveling etc. 

Thank you!

Two minors
Has anyone graduated with two minors? Is that a thing? I somehow gravitated towards taking enough electives to be able to declare two minors, if that is possible. I’ve spoken with my advisor only about the first minor as of now.

CMU tepper or UC Berkeley pre-haas

I was recently admitted to some amazing schools like UVA, UNC Chapel Hill, USC, UCLA, CMU and Berkeley and am super grateful to have the fortune to choose.

Im dead-set on going to Business school🐍 and would possibly like to do a minor in something tech (CS, information systems etc). In the future I see myself either doing consulting, becoming an entrepreneur in the start-up space or being a media/ entertainment industry execute (very confusing I know I’m sorry😭)

Anyway, I’ve boiled my top choices down to CMU and Berkeley and cannot pick between the 2. Ignoring any cost factor, I would love advice on which school to choose.

CMU: Pros: Tepper is a 4 year program and has around 150 kids, private school w a lot more personal attention, small classes, great tech ecosystem and a minor is a part of the syllabus so I can do IS, HCI etc, also has a great design program in case I want to do product design, not curved classes/grade deflation —-> I think I’ll stand out more at tepper???

Cons: Pittsburg is kinda dead, tooo cold, heard terrible things about the social life and workload (please bust the myths🥺), tepper is not as prestigious(debatable) or a feeder to consulting firms, idk how well it recruits to west coast(or internships), less school spirit so possible weaker alumni network than Berkeley

Berkeley

Pros: californiaaaaa, seems like more well rounded college experience, Silicon Valley, state school so diverse amazing people, haas dominates the west coast so recruiting and internships are easier, already have a small community of people I gel with, also road trips and food>>>

Cons: haas requires the admissions process all aver again, 30% acceptance rate and 2 year program, grade deflation, competitive stress culture scares me a lot, consulting clubs are suuper hard to get into, huge classes and fighting for opportunities, doesn’t have an IS program and declaring cs major is kinda hard.

I know a lot of these have assumptions so please feel free to bust them. I’m very confused and appreciate any help. Thank youuuu besties💖💖💖

C@CM asynchronous over the summer?
I'm planning to take C@CM over the summer and I was wondering if it's asynchronous.

CMU SCS vs Berkeley L&S CS w/ Regents
Hi! I'm super conflicted between these two schools. Here's where I'm at right now:

**CMU**

*Pros*: Higher chance of landing FAANG internships, easier to get interesting research (less people), more face-time with faculty, guaranteed computer science degree, more collaborative

*Cons*: Away from home, stress culture + harder academics (?), weather, Pittsburgh < Berkeley as a city

**Berkeley**

*Pros*: Great weather, Regents scholarship (so priority course registration, housing, faculty mentor), familiarity (super familiar with Berkeley + know a ton of people there), less stressful academically

*Cons*: Harder to get internships/research in areas that I like (I don't have a ton of connections in FAANG for referrals), not guaranteed CS (though I'm decently confident I can get the 3.3 gpa), more competitive

For context, I'm super career-minded and want to land a solid job hopefully in FAANG after undergrad. But I do want to have fun in college (not partying or anything, more like grabbing dinner w friends/exploring the city, etc). 

What are your thoughts? What do you like best about CMU SCS?

Thanks for your help!!

Is bike theft an issue on CMU campus/in Shadyside?
I’m an incoming grad student and the apartment I’m looking at won’t necessarily have space to store my bike inside. Should I be concerned about my bike getting stolen/are there extra precautions I can take? I don’t have the nicest bike in the world but it was a huge problem in my undergrad town.

CMU or Rice for Mechanical Engineering?
Hi everyone. I’ve been accepted to both Rice and CMU for mechanical engineering. I’ve visited both schools and the cost is not that different for each school. Obviously weather and size make these schools different but the culture of each school seems different too. Really hard to get a feel for the schools during COVID where no one even allows a guided tour and admissions offices are closed. I hear great things about the resources and cutting edge stuff going on at CMU but I hear amazing things about the collaborative culture at Rice which sounds like less of a pressure cooker. I’m not the most extroverted person so could see myself falling through the cracks at a large school which is why I chose these two schools. I hear that the MechE program at Rice is not as well-resourced as CMU’s but it’s ranked nationally in the top 20. I have 10 days left to make a decision. Where should I go?

Hi I'm gonna take 21-256 in the summer with Flaherty and I'm really nervous bc everyone I talk to is scaring me by telling me Flaherty is a really hard prof and saying I might fail... :( 

I'm also gonna be taking 70-122 at the same time but now I'm super worried and wondering if i should just drop 70-122 so that I won't fail 21-256

Could anyone give me some tips?

Tuition depending on classes enrolled?

Do employers actually care about the CMU degree?
Do you think that the degree carry value in the industry especially the tech degrees such as CS or IS? Do people really care if you are a CMU grad?

Is there anywhere to borrow cables from at CMU?
So my my Mac broke yesterday and I am trying to back it up to my time machine prior to taking it to get fixed (though since it is apple replacement is possible), but the drive used for the time machine is a seagate drive and I don’t have the proprietary cable.

So my question is would there be anywhere on campus from which one might be able to borrow a cable?
--------------------------------------------------
This is what I used to study for the exams. Hope it will help you too!

Grad Student Apartment: Shadyside Commons vs Bakery vs Albion/Coda
Hi, I'm moving to Pittsburgh in late July for my 1.5- year-long master's program and got to check out the city and campus for two days this past weekend. I toured several different apartments including Shadyside Commons, Bakery Living, Albion, and Coda, and honestly a little torn between prioritizing proximity to campus vs amenities. Shadyside is a 15 min walk to campus but doesn't have as good of amenities as the other buildings and is actually $200 more expensive per month. It does seem like Covid will die down by fall and the school's pushing hard for in-person classes... The other apartments are a 30-40 min walk from campus and 15 min by bus. What would you suggest to an incoming grad student? Any and all two cents is appreciated xx
--------------------------------------------------
Trouble finding roommates
I am having trouble finding roommates and the people I have tried to contact haven't yet responded so I was wondering if it was okay to continue on with the General Room Selection process and choose my preferences for the dorms after Thursday once my time slot is made available.  In this case, would I be randomly paired with another student who also shares similar dorm preferences?

Also if anybody else is having a tough time finding roommates, hmu! I am a rising sophomore btw.

I will (hopefully) be coming to CMU for exchange in January 2022 from Singapore, and I'm trying to plan my courses for the next few semesters. When will CMU release the course catalog for the next academic year?

For some context, I'm an economics major and I would like to take 73-365 Firms, Market Structures, and Strategy and 73-372 International Money and Finance in my exchange semester. Do any of you know if these courses will be offered in the Spring 2022 semester?

CMU art major honest opinions
I've been admitted into CMU for art, RISD, and SAIC, but cmu seems to provide the most financial aid.

So hard to meet people; feeling very lonely
a freshman here. Sorry for the incoming rant but it's just so hard to meet people here. Am off-campus rn and I just can't meet anyone at all. I heavily regret my decision to come to Pittsburgh. Seems like the social situation would've been better at home. And, I just cannot take social media anymore. I see fellow freshman out there, enjoying their college life and am so jealous of them. Heavy FOMO kicking in. I wanted to join some club but is there any that meets in-person? anyway, the semester's mostly over so ig doesn't matter. uhhh

I remember I was so excited of coming to cmu and meeting people but it's just all hopeless now. how do I make friends???

sorry again for the rant :(

Health insurance
I will be attending cmu this fall and was wondering if anyone has been able to find a cheaper alternative to the student health care plan, that still falls under all the requirements? My last resort would be taking out a loan to cover the cost of the insurance. On top of my RCOA, I won’t be able to afford the student health insurance. 

PS- I wish health insurance was optional. I hate that it’s required but not included in the cost of attendance
--------------------------------------------------
Super slow i20 process
International grad students at CMU, why is the i20 process so slow at CMU? Literally all my friends from other colleges got their i20s within a week. Why is it so slow here?

Expensive School
Dude why is this school so expensive, I come from a poor, divorced family (so literally half the income) and I would only get a 30k grant which leaves me paying 45k a year. I like the school but not enough to go deeply into debt for it when I can go to UMD for 18.5k a year
--------------------------------------------------
Is pedal and park still a thing?
I have heard there is a bike maintenance place around CMU where they have tools and pumps that are for public use. Is that place still open? If so, do they have any equipment for skateboards? If not, are there any kind souls on campus who have a skateboard wrench that they would be willing to lend to me for like an hour or so?
--------------------------------------------------
What do you guys do for health insurance + dental + vision
Decided to go to CMU instead of Berkeley mostly cause of fin aid and school population. Now I'm trying to figure out my health insurance situation.

Currently on medicaid, but if I'm moving states (to PA), would I be able to reapply successfully as a dependent college student? Anyone have experience with this?

Otherwise, what would be the best way to get normal health insurance plus dental and vision. I have glasses and also use contacts for sports. I also need dental insurance and checkups for chipped teeth from skateboarding.

Would appreciate advice because my parents are pretty clueless and can't find much info googling on college students/medicaid. Thank you!!!

ece imb worth it?
hi! i'm currently an undergrad ece and i was planning on doing the imb program for ece but I recently found out that they changed the ECE masters requirements. Now, all of the masters course requirements can only be fulfilled by CIT courses. I was originally planning to take a decent amount of SCS courses for my masters since i'm more interested in software but now i'm not really sure what to do. is it even worth it for me to do the masters in ECE? 

link to updated ECE masters requirements: [https://www.ece.cmu.edu/academics/ms-ece/standard-program.html](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/academics/ms-ece/standard-program.html)

Grad school- what are you expected to do over the summer months?
I'll be coming to CMU for a PhD this September. Though I am not 100% clear on what is expected of us in terms of the summers. My financial aid only provides funding for 9 months (which I now know is the standard package). I suppose this leaves you free to try an internship over the summer, but what if I want to continue doing research (although remotely- It would be nice to go back home and see family in a different continent then!)?

It is just a bit confusing for me, as I have read other college vacation policies are 'up to four weeks, including the school and national holidays' but that you are also at the mercy of your supervisor as to whether you get that full amount. Surely they can't expect us to continue doing research if they are not paying us during that time? (Although of course I would want to still be doing research, paid, during that time, but from home). But considering other school policies of just a few weeks holiday, it just doesn't seem to gel that they are giving us 3 months free time.

I have heard also that the source of the funding can change (from departmental to supervisor funding, once you have chosen your supervisor at a later stage). So perhaps it is the case that the early years are essentially regarded as a masters, and that is why we are given this vacation time and corresponding funding cut. Then in the latter years when the funding switcthes to supervisor funding, it is more like full time work with vacation time dictated by the supervisor?

If anyone can help me figure out how this works that would be great

RA positions in IS or CS
I’m an IS major (sophomore) and am considering getting involved in some research related to IS or CS next semester, however I have zero research experience, and I’m also having a hard time trying to find research labs that I can try apply to. I don’t really have any close connections with IS or CS professors, so I’m not sure whom should I reach out to. Any suggestions on interesting labs or research group from faculty members in these two fields? I’m mostly interested in software development and data science.

What are somethings that you like about CMU?
Hello guys, as a incoming freshman, I was curious what you guys think about the school.  What are somethings that you like the school?

Thank you and have a great rest of the day!

Housing questions
Hi, I am a CMU grad student and since I graduate in Fall, I was planning to share a room with a friend who is taking a full year lease. Most of the responses we got were that it is not allowed to have more than one person in a room or that we would have to pay extra. Just want to know if that's the scene in most places. Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this.

Is it worth investing in a bicycle?
I'm from a suburb and have only biked for occasional utility versus as a hobby. My knowledge about biking especially in a city is embarrassingly nonexistent and I will likely end up in the bus lane and get run over so I wanted to ask about it. I live about 15 minutes (both bus time and bike time) away from campus in Squirrel Hill south. I'm assuming we'll have on-campus classes next year. I wrote up a list of pros and cons but it got pretty long so for now I wanted to ask just in general. I know pgh has a a bike sharing program but afaik it's not very extensive (also there are no stations very near where I live), but if anyone has any experience with it and would recommend it I'd love to hear about that too.

I havent been doing well in 21127 (i dont think I will be able to pass) but i am also taking 15122 currently and 21127 is a corequisite for that class. Do you think I can drop 21127 and take it over the summer?

Edit:I have successfully dropped !!! it was some good stuff now i can celebrate

To the boy I do math homework with:
Please shut the hell up.

I don't need you to tell me every week that:

* it was easy for me to get an internship because I'm  female and a domestic student
* I am only interested in hardware because it's easy
* OS and Compilers are the "Main" software courses and if I don't take them, it's because I only want to do easy things
* I don't want to do a "Real" job because I want to go into product management.
   * Getting an MBA is easy and doesn't lead to any "real" jobs
   * Wanting to get an MBA means that I want to "take the easy way out"
   * Getting any job that isn't "\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ engineering" is a job where I "won't have to use my brain"
   * Any job that isn't 100% technical is "bullshit"

I hate you.

This got a lot more traction than I thought so ig I'll just say some general things here:

* His comments don't hurt me too much, it just really annoys me because I finally have found things that I like/care about and I can't enjoy it
* I would stop studying with him but its already so late in the semester and I just don't have the energy to meet new people 
* And thank you guys for all of the support

Best (or worst) Area to live off-campus for cyclists
Hello fellow redditors at CMU,

I'm a prospective graduate student of the MSIN (a program under INI - the information networking institute, located in the top-left corner of the campus). I'm currently looking for the best apartments (or areas) to live for bike commuters. However, I noticed that there exist extremely bike-unfriendly avenues (ex: Ellsworth avenue) that are quite narrow and have a single path). Also, there's an elevation between central Oakland and the CMU campus, and one between the squirrel hill area and the CMU campus, but in fact, I prioritize bike lane over elevation. Therefore, out of the options of North Oakland, Central Oakland, Shady Side, Squirrel Hills, only North Oakland seems to meet my needs. However, the apartments in the North Oakland area are way too expensive. Is there any CMU cyclist who could share any advice on where to (or never to) live?

&#x200B;

TL;DR:

Look for cheap housing off-campus where the commuting route is bike-friendly (has bike lanes or sidewalks where scattered people walk, doesn't have crazy elevation).

15-150 Appreciation Thread
Even with how the midterm may have gone yesterday, you can't deny that 15-150 is an excellent class. Both Prof. Crary and Prof. Erdmann put in an insane amount of work to teach it and I'm sure many people learn a lot from the class as a result. Even over Zoom the class has been a lot of fun and I learn new things every day from their lecture. The TAs also do a great job keeping up with homework and labs, the work they do is truly incredible and I'm glad to have the opportunity to learn from them.

Questions regarding SSN for MS.
Hi I'm an intl student and will be joining CMU this fall for the MSR program. I read on the official SSN document that to obtain SSN you need an on campus job. 

I know that jobs are common in other universities which my friends go to, but so far I've not heard anyone talking about on campus jobs at CMU.  

So my questions are:
1. How crucial is SSN? Do I absolutely have to have it?
2. If it is important, do students generally do on campus jobs? 
3. If so, what all jobs are least energy consuming/distracting from research?

Thanks!

CMU vs Berkeley (please help me choose a college for undergrad)
I posted this on r/csMajors and got mixed opinions.

I intend to major in L&S CS at Berkeley. I plan to do StatML (data science) at CMU, though CS was my first option.

**CMU**

Pros:

* Top CS/data science school
* I like the city
* Great average starting salary
* Great interdisciplinary study options (I really like design and I hope to take some classes)
* Smaller classes
* Good financial aid offer (cost of attendance after aid: 22k per year)

Cons:

* Stress culture/crazy difficult workload (have seen a lot of negative posts about this so I'm kinda scared)
* Weather is meh
* SCS is nearly impossible to transfer into (maybe I can do a minor instead?)
* (allegedly) social life is dead (if anyone can give insight on this, that'd be great)

**Berkeley**

Pros:

* Top CS school
* Can do CS instead of data science
* I like the city/weather is nice
* Near silicon valley
* Great job opportunities
* Nicer campus than CMU (imo)
* Good social life
* Considered as an Education Opportunity Program student
* (minor pro) One of my friends is going here which would help with adjusting since I live outside of US

Cons:

* Out of state tuition (cost of attendance after aid: 62k per year) My parents have said that they are willing to pay but I don't wanna put too much of a burden on them. Can I pay this debt off with a CS job?
* Stress culture/competition
* Much bigger school (not as good connections)
* No guaranteed CS major (have to meet major requirements)

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Edit: Thank you all for the insight, it’s been super helpful during the decision making process! I’ll be attending CMU in the fall!

MSCS Incoming Students group?
Hi!

As the title suggests, I’m wondering if, by any chance, somebody has already created a WhatsApp/discord/telegram group for incoming MSCS students to communicate! Would love to get in touch!

15150 and 15213 together
Is this manageable for the fall semester? I plan on taking 18202 and another ECE core (either 220 and 290) or one or two gen eds.

Edit: To clear it up, I plan on taking one of the other ECE cores or instead take one or two gen eds (so 4-5 classes total)

Avoid Chicken Curry at Taste of India Today
Usually, the food at taste of india is tastefully undercooked- tender enough to have you questioning, but cooked just enough to be safe. Today, this was not the case. The chicken was literally pink inside, and tasted raw to go with it. Good luck out there friends.

Dropping a Class with a Wavier
How does dropping a class with a wavier work?

I am looking to drop a class this semester and I have sent my wavier to my advisor, how long will it take to officially be dropped from the course?

Also I am probably going to be taking the course i dropped over the summer cus im actually failing it ;) lol is it just me or does this semester really suck butt like last semester was ok and i thought it should get easier since we were already used to online learning for one semester but its gotten 15 times worse I really thought it would be ok bc the stuff we r learning is so interesting but holy shit its actual torture right now.

anyways if anyone knows how long it takes to get a course dropped and if theres anything else i have to do pls lemme know
--------------------------------------------------
Pretty sure I just failed the 15-150 midterm :/
Not sure if anyone of you have felt this before but whenever I take exams I’m literally not capable of critical thinking because I’m so nervous and can only do the super easy problems.. so sorry to the TAs that will have to grade that. I’m so disappointed with myself rn, I studied really hard for it too

Funding for MS Mechanical Engineering Advanced Study
Hello, I've been admitted to the MS in Mechanical Engineering - Advanced Study program at CMU, planning to specialize in robotics. However, before committing, I'm having some last-minute reservations about the very high tuition. I definitely am hoping to apply for funding through any possible method (being a TA, assistantship, fellowships, etc). Could anyone speak from personal experience on whether the opportunity to apply for such funding would still be available before the fall semester? Thanks so much for the help!

Just committed to CMU for Graduate School!!
Hey everyone! I just committed to CMU for graduate school (MS in Mechanical Engineering - Research) and am so excited to begin my program in the Fall. Does anyone have any advice for me as a potential graduate student regarding housing, socialising events, things to do in Pittsburgh and anything interesting that may or may not be major specific? 

I also couldn’t find any communities/groups for admitted graduate students at CMU and would love to meet people beforehand, so feel free to shoot me a dm if you’d like to connect :)

How difficult is CMU SCS?
Hi! Im trying to decide between CMU SCS and Cornell cs. I’m worried that CMU is overly difficult and time consuming, but at the same time that I’m missing out (on the #1 cs education) if I choose to go to Cornell. I guess it’s a choice I have to make but I’m wondering if anyone can say roughly how hard and how many hours per week SCS students work? 

Thank you!

Appropriate number of sources for a 6 page history research paper?
Hey guys, first year here and I’m really not sure how many sources are required for my term paper in a history class. I’ve been having a debate with a friend and she insists that more than 20 sources are required at minimum, but I am only able to find 10 or so that are reliable and relevant to my topic. Any advice?

Upperclass housing
Basically I really like having a single this semester cause of covid so I want to try to get a single next year too. But when I was looking on the housing website it looks like even the apartments that are "apartment singles" aren't actually singles but have shared living spaces. Are there any that are truly singles?

CMU SE in Silicon Valley for Fall 2021!!!
Hello World!

I recently got admitted into CMU SE in Silicon Valley for Fall 2021!!!!!!!!! How exciting :) I know it's a super small campus compared to the one in Pittsburgh, but I just want to make some friends prior to the start of the term!

I've got some amateur questions for all the seniors here tho:

1. Is there a social group for newly admitted students? Can't wait to meet all the cool people out there
2. What is the international student tuition? I've looked it up on many sources but I couldn't find the price specifically for I N T E R N A T I O N A L
3. Where do people live? Finding a cheap accommodation nearby the campus is probably unrealistic, so I'd like to find a place that's within 30-minute drive to the campus. 
4. What is the must-do list in SV campus? I've heard that it's boring, no-life, small campus... but trust me, nothing is comparable to Waterloo, Canada

Let's network! Cheers.

Incoming Freshman Dorm Application Advice?
Hi, I'm an incoming freshman and was hoping for some guidance on dorm applications! I noticed that as an IPS student, a lot of my classes seemed to be centered around Posner Hall, so I centered my dorm search around that area (I'm also not sure if this is a good strategy to begin with). 

So far, Boss and Donner seem to be my top choices, but I was hoping to hear what some of you guys had to say about them, since I've never had the chance to be at campus. I also heard that some dorms do not have AC, and I was wondering how big of a factor / detriment that should be in my decision making process. 

I would appreciate any amount of advice / comments, thank you for reading!

Aid for a to-be US resident?
Hello everybody! I'm sure that many of you already know that cmu doesn't offer aid to its international students. However, I have lived in the US on a visa for 13+ years and I have been waiting to get my green card (which would make me a US resident) for over a decade. My status has just started its processing (YAYAYAY!!!) and I predict that I will be able to (hopefully) get my GC within the next year or two. Could I ask for aid when this happens or would I have to complete my degree as an international student? Also, if I did my masters at cmu, would I get aid then? 

I know this is a very niche topic so ANY information at all would be extremely helpful! Thank you :)
--------------------------------------------------
I love CMU
I love the campus. Its beautiful! A mix of super Gothic hard-core winter tank architecture like Wean, hamerschlag, and doherty, contrasted with the modernity of Gates and Scott hall. You can tell that the Tepper building was like a mix of the two styles. I seriously love the Tepper building btw, its like a building from the future!!

The makerspaces with the meches grinding away look so cool. Im proud of going here because I'm surrounded by such talented and hard working people. I like to imagine that when I get out into the working world, ill tell people I went to CMU, and because they can imagine what my classmates are like, they think some scrub like me is on their level!

I'm just playing. CMU is my home away from home. The professors have my back so, so much. My department is like a family. I dont like some of them and I think some of them are annoying, but man I love them all. Because everyone in this school seems to have my back!

I didn't always feel this way. I HATED cmu when I first came here. Absolutely hated it. In my first few years here, i wanted to jump off Pausch bridge a few times. I felt so, so, so alone. So homesick and resentful. I had some dark winters at this school.

But I stuck through it. No, WE stuck through it. Together. Every office hour, every frat party where the nerds finally let off some steam, every crappy taste of India plate, every amazing exchange sandwich, every ice cold night waiting to paint the fence, every holding the door open for the person behind you, everything. Every bit of it, we did it and do it together.

Today, I am a proud tartan. So, so proud. I love this school. I love its people, its pride, its passion, its innovativeness, its inclusiveness, its resilience, its accepting of all people from anywhere and any background, its solidarity in the face of adversity, and just, its CMU-ness!!

I love the way CMU embraces all its quirks.

I love the way I've always been able to find a listening ear, as long as I asked humbly and expected nothing. Maybe I couldn't get an extension every time, but im grateful nonetheless.

And I love the way that my experience here has shaped me into the person I am today, for better or for worse.

I love this school. If you don't feel this way, I respect that. But I dont feel the same way as you.

I love CMU. I love it deeply in my heart. So GO TARTANS!!




Edit: more things I love about CMU:

 I love going to Schatz and eating until I feel like exploding. 

I love seeing freshmen start to make friends, and overhearing their conversations with each other and theyre awkward as hell lol. Freshmen everywhere are awkward, but these are CMU freshmen. Now This is awkwardness on steroids!

I loved breaking into the graduate ECE lounge, getting to the top of the hamerschlag rotunda, and smoking a joint up there with friends. (Im not advocating for you to do this,, im just acknowledging that this happens.. also dont do drugs.) 

I love flagstaff Hill. Its view is so hard to beat!

I love sleeping on those reclining chairs in Sorells.

I love going to the 2nd floor of wean and picking out candy and chips like a goddamn child to prep for the all nighter ahead of me.

I loved when orgs would set up in front of Doherty and I would have to look straight ahead and avoid eye contact because sorry, im not interested!!

I love that doherty hall kind of smells.

I love that non SCS students can't get above the 5th (6th?) Story of Gates, because I like to tell visitors that they do some crazy missile tracking, drone bombing, Middle East terrorizing computer science up there. But they probably do do that, which is kind of fucked up. Still, Its funny to see visitors eyes widen from imagining the mystery of it.

I love the first day of spring thats above 65 degrees each year. The entire campus is ALIVE with activity.

I love the gyms in the UC and in Tepper. Non-CMU students tell me that when they drive past our school on Forbes, they get super jealous of our gyms, and sports fields.

I love the evenings when I'm having a pleasant evening and I hear the Kiltie Band playing from the cut. On moodier days, im like "Yo keep it down!!" But more often its just another quirk of CMU im proud of.

Carnival is cool too, which may be the understatement of this entire subreddit!!

Walking to the sky looks like shit though imo ngl. They need to bulldoze that thing over asap. Its funny though, it actually used to have half the number of "people" on it, and then one day we woke up and they filled in the gaps with more "people". It kind of freaked us out, as if they were starting to multiply or something lol.

I love walking from Gates to Donner through the path next to Gesling Stadium. When its winter and they have all the xmas lights up. That walk is really nice!

Edit2: a few more things

I love how from around 5 pm to 7:30 pm, everyone that lives in squirrel hill is at the forbes and morewood bus stop, but sometimes the busses just get too full of people to let more people on.. when its super cold, this is the worst!! I had a method though, I would always flank the crowd from the right, somehow that always worked and I always one of the first people to get on the bus.

Booth and buggy are cool!

I loved giving blocks to my friends as a freshman. It was a great way to become friends with upperclassmen
--------------------------------------------------
Anyone have photos of CMU?
I can't visit CMU due to the pandemic, but I would love to see photos of CMU from students' point of view. A lot of photos online are v edited, so I can't feel the actual \~vibe\~ of what it's like to be a student there on a normal day.

Why is life so shitty this semester
I remember coming to Pittsburgh thinking I would be happy and make new friends this semester. My roommate is a hermit. We barely talk and I technically only have one good friend or so I thought. He likes to spend time and party with his other friends, so I usually don’t see him often. I made some new friends as well but they live on campus and I live off campus, so we don’t see each other often.  Life feels very lonely and my classes just drain my energy. I just want this semester to be over. In high school, I had so many friends I never got to feel lonely. Now I feel lonely 90% of the time. Sometimes I wonder if I should kill myself. I know it’s stupid and I don’t have the guts to do it, but the thought has crossed my mind a few times. I genuinely just hate this semester so much.
--------------------------------------------------
Is CMU worth 80k per year?
Hey, I am currently an international student, so that means I would have to pay full price for a CMU education. I didnt actually get in, just waitlisted, but Im not sure if I should take up another person's spot on the priority waitlist. My alternative is UIUC where I would pay around 50k per year. In terms of rankings on US News, CMU is 1 and UIUC IS 7 for the Computer Engineering Major
--------------------------------------------------
Is tying your self-worth to your work and grades a very CMU thing?
I feel like out of many other college subreddits I lurk in, r/cmu has the most posts ranting about the fear of failing or otherwise getting a bad QPA. I feel like even in other similarly rigorous schools (MIT/Chicago/Princeton) at least they find some fun in the process and ultimately look upon their college experience fondly. For instance, MIT has the duality of IHTFP (I hate this fking place / I have truly found paradise). But I feel like the overall sentiment I get from the students/alums here is that the grueling work pays off financially, but nothing else. 

And I mean, investment wise I guess we're in a lot better place than ppl from a lot of schools where the work doesn't even end up paying off in the long run but also?? I'm a fun-loving person and so far staring into the screen for 10+ hours/day while watching lecture recordings hasn't been the most favorite part of my life.

Is it bad that I hate my first year writing class the most out of everything right now
Well... hate might be a strong word, but I definitely don't like it. I dislike the topic of the section I'm in, and literally the only reason I'm in this section is because that's really the only time that works out for me. It's hard for me to get started on assignments and I don't really know anyone in my class. I'm in harder classes but I don't think I find any of them as annoying...

How is 15-440/640 course from SCS?
I've heard it's tough. Can anyone who has taken tell me how the course is and about the outcomes?

Computational Finance (BSCF)?
This is my first time posting and I’m not sure if I’m doing everything right. So basically I am a senior in high school and was recently admitted to the Tepper School of Business at CMU. I am interested in pursuing a career in finance and have heard that CMU’s computational finance major is top-notch but is extremely difficult to get in. I’d like to ask that, as someone with absolutely no background in programming and computer science and finance, how likely is it for me to get the major (assuming I have good grades in multiple math courses)? Also, is the major really as good as it seems?
--------------------------------------------------
How to prepare for 15-122/21-127
I've heard people say this combo is pretty tough. What can I do to prepare over the summer? Any particularly hard concepts?

What are the negatives to committing to CMU?
I just finish my virtual tour and everything mentioned was super positive and great. I want to know the opposite side. Let me know!
--------------------------------------------------
Feeling kinda stupid
Earlier this semester I dropped 15122 and added a gen-ed because the workload was too much with concepts, interp, and matsci. I thought I was going to have a chill semester because I'm only taking 37 units now, but somehow I've still been struggling. I did really well last semester with a much heavier courseload so I though I could handle this semester but it turns out that I cannot.

Everyone says Intro to MatSci is an incredibly easy class, but it just doesn't make sense to me, and so I've been doing poorly. Everyone said that concepts with Ervin is easier, and I'm still struggling with that too. And all of the people that I've met virtually and keep in tough with are taking have harder courses and heavier courseloads and doing perfectly fine.

I think I'm going to end up with a B in concepts, which I would have been fine with, but now its making me feel really bad because I have such an easy course load. Also I'm an ECE freshman so I know that it only gets worse from here, and I'm terrified that I won't be able to handle the rigor and that I will graduate with an insanely low GPA. I also feel bad that my parents are investing so much money into me to put me through college and I feel like I'm letting them down by not doing everything as well as I possibly could.

:(

weird question... but dating life at CMU o-o
hey I mean... from the title I just gotta ask...

likely going to fail class for the 3rd time
okay not really failing but equivalent

Did super bad 2 semesters ago so I dropped the class

Took it last semester- stuck it out- but ended up with a D. Needed a C for credit, had to retake it again :(

Likely going to get a D again, and I'm going to have to take it again next semester :( I feel so down that i'm probably going to have to take it again junior year. 2 years of pain...

:(((( enjoy your weekend everybody, I'm going to grind the hell out of the next few weeks to just get a 70 please

don't know what the point of this post is but wanted to let it out 
--------------------------------------------------
hi all! im really into public policy and data science, seeing that CMU is renown for being an interdisciplinary school, would I be able to pursue both of my interests?

Question about declaring an Engineering major
I'm an incoming freshman and I was accepted to the School of Engineering, but when I applied, I chose Civil/Environmental Engineering as my first choice (and that is my only option on the CMU portal). Does that mean that, when declaring a major, I can ONLY choose Civil/Environmental Engineering, or am I free to chose a different engineering major like ECE?

Thanks!

Difficulty of course
How difficult is 36-218 compared to 15259,  21325 and other math courses? I already have a heavy rest of my schedule so I can’t afford to take this class for my probability/statistics requirement if it is too much work.

is cmu a primarily stem school?
i guess i’ve had this notion in my head that cmu is just a stem school but now i think i may be wrong. i’m accepted as an engineering major, but if i end up wanted to switch out, are there other majors besides science and technology? i just don’t want to end up stuck

CMU Waitlist
hi guys! I'm about to fill out the CMU waitlist update form and for those who were admitted off the waitlist in previous years, did you treat it as a LOCI or just a space for any updates? I'm not sure how I should go about writing it and I know CMU doesn't consider LOCIs in general. should I just give basic updates about my academics/extracurriculars or are they also looking for stuff about why CMU is my top choice and my fit there? (I'm opting in priority waitlist if that makes a difference)

the prompt is still "What additional information or updates would you like Carnegie Mellon to consider?" I think

advice would be greatly appreciated :D thank you!

Best "can't miss" spots for a prospective student visitor?
I'm an admitted student for the Class of 2025 and I'm going to be visiting CMU next week. Any recommendations (either on campus or in the broader area) of things/places I should make sure to check out? Trying to get as much of a snapshot as possible of the student experience.

How do you like BEPO?
Any BEPO majors here? 

How do you like it? Is it stressful (like i hear about engg majors)?
--------------------------------------------------
how bad is stress culture and how hard is it to adjust to the difficult level of the classes for engineering?
hi i got accepted into the college of engineering for the class of 2025, and in all honesty i’m fucking scared to go. 

i’ve heard that stress culture is really bad, and i’m also scared for the courses since i don’t know if i’m prepared for the intensity. i consider myself a hard worker and i try a lot in school, but i’m just having second thoughts about attending because i don’t know if i’m going to struggle a lot. does anyone have any insight? also if i can minor in compsci even as an engineering major?

About taking 15213 in the fall semester of junior year by a CS major.
Hi all,

I just wanted to know what are the disadvantages/problems of taking 15213 in the fall semester of junior year. Usually, the CS majors take the course in the fall semester of sophomore year. What kind of problems may be created for taking 15213 one year later than the standard time? Will it impose any problem in graduating on time? 

Thanks.

High school senior questions about ChemE at CMU
I am a high school senior and right now I am deciding where I want to study chemical engineering in college. My career goal is to work in r&d in the pharmaceutical industry. I have a few questions about the chemical engineering program at CMU, so if you have any insights/advice that would be very helpful!

1. From what I can tell, the engineering school at CMU is strong but more highly focused on electrical/computer engineering. Do you think CMU is strong for ChemE?
2. Does any pharma companies recruit from CMU (ex: Merck)?
3. Is PISCES still a program here? If it isn't, does CMU have a good co-op program?
4. The job placement rate for ChemE majors at CMU seems to be declining (from 77% in 2017 to just 43% in 2020). I know that the pandemic messed things up, but rates were declining before then too. Why are more students at CMU choosing to go to grad school now?

CMU Tepper advice
Can any current Tepper student comment on their experience in terms of culture and overall vibe? I am a senior and a prospective student. Does the school have a very quant vibe. Do people go into consulting jobs or primarily finance or technical (operations/ data scientists etc). Any help would be appreciated.

How helpful is 15-150 stuff for SWE internships?
Taking it this summer. Interested in algo dev / trading stuff as well, but I don’t have 122 under my belt so wondering how I’ll fare if I take it next fall. 

Also can anybody who work as algo devs for HFT/quant funds shed some light on the recruiting process (GPA requirement, helpful courses, etc)? So far I’ve only seen core devs and systems engineers who are CMU undergrads.

What do 0xx humanities courses do? (AP/transfer credit for SCS)
Hi, I'm an incoming student in computer science at SCS for the Fall 2021 semester.

I noticed that my humanities APs count as 0xx courses, but it seems like none of the 0xx courses count toward the humanities and arts gened requirements: [Humanities and Arts Requirements (cmu.edu)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/academics/undergraduate/humanities-and-arts-reqs) It also seems like the 0xx courses aren't prereqs for any courses either (correct me if I'm wrong)

I heard that while some APs may not neccessarily count towards certain requirements or prereqs, I should still take their exams because I can use the units from the 0xx courses to graduate early. How does that work? Can someone clarify? Thank you!

CMU Engineering vs Olin Engineering
Hi! I've been super conflicted choosing between the two. Cost is relatively the same, and I really do like both schools. I'm most likely going for ECE, but not completely committed to that

 I know the biggest pro for Olin for me is location (its much closer to home) and the amount of involvement I would get at an undergrad level in research and projects. But I'm not really on board with going to a school where the class size is around 80 and the opportunities outside of engineering seem really limited. 

On the other hand, I'm in love with so many aspects of CMU and all the opportunities it brings, but its 10 hrs from home, which I'm not necessarily sure I want to do. I've also heard rumors about people being really competitive with one another rather than the collaborative environment I'm looking for, but I'm not sure how much of that is true. Also, I'm not sure how often undergrads get the opportunity to really get experience in projects and research.

Any current CIT students who can help?

Tepper for consulting/ media & entertainment career
Any thoughts on the above? As I look at the positions that people take up, they seem to be very technical in nature. Either it is finance or even in consulting more operational/ data scientists types. Can an existing Tepper student pls advice if Tepper is more a good fit for students who want a quantitative/ technical career interests. I am considering Emory and USC as other options.

Should I fill out the priority waitlist form right on April 9?
Applicant for the Class of 2025 here. Got waitlisted at CMU and I plan to join the priority waitlist. Their FAQ says you can submit the form any time between April 9 and May 3, but doesn't mention whether or not it's first-come-first-serve or whether you're otherwise advantaged by submitting the form sooner. I ask because I'm planning to visit campus next week, and would rather wait until then to see if anything new comes up, but I'm not sure whether that would set me back compared to those who filled out the form immediately. Anyone have any advice?

CS minor at CMU vs. CS major at another school
Hi! I was admitted into the School of Art, but was rejected for my first choice (BCSA), so I plan on transferring into BCSA if I end up attending. I want to get an education in both art and CS, so I'm looking into CMU because of its interdisciplinary opportunities. Could anyone provide some input on doing BCSA/ a CS minor at CMU vs. doing a CS major at another school? My other choices are WashU and NYU. Thank you!

Northeastern vs. CMU for business
hi guys!!

so the waitlist opens in 2 days (I'll be doing priority waitlist, and I'm kinda on the fence)

&#x200B;

Northeastern NU In program seems cool and is still a decent business school...

Boston = super fun area but high cost of living

NU = co op opportunities and more scholarship was given to me!

&#x200B;

but... if I did get accepted off the CMU waitlist... CMU has much more career prestige especially since I'm interested in consulting. The price however... yikes (my grant only lasts 1 year since my brother is graduating this year too...)

&#x200B;

so in the long run CMU will be better for my career although it's quite quite expensive... but I was just wondering ur guys input on this and whether Pittsburg is a fun city?

&#x200B;

Also if anyone could elaborate on Tepper culture, opportunities, grade inflation / deflation, social life, city life, and dorms that would be cool! Also how expensive is off campus housing for pittsburg (i'm trying to map out future expenses)

Comp archi Mac os?
Since my windows laptop has been constantly freezing for couple of seconds, I'm thinking of going m1 Mac this summer, but I'm a lil conflicted cuz I heard I might not be able to run some softwares on the M1 Mac os. Can anyone confirm this, and should I just stay on windows? Also, if I were to buy anothee laptop, is 8gb fine for comp archi stuff? Thks ahead

Dropping a course now?
I’m thinking of dropping a course rn and i was wondering if I could use my voucher to drop it. Is there someone I should talk to before I take action. Sorry, this is my first time so I was just wondering what the steps are. Also how will my GPA be affected?
--------------------------------------------------
Anyone (vaccinated) play squash?
I saw it looks like the courts opened up. I'm a first-year PhD getting 1st vaccine dose on Tuesday.

CMU has such nice courts and I feel like they don't get used.

I'm not a pro (never played consistently) but am athletic and can (maybe) hold my own. I'd be interested in playing with someone technically better than me.

Please Offer Some Suggestions about My Offer Choosing
Hi, I got three offers and one waitlist for my M.S. application of this Fall. I will list them in the following and if you can offer anything information I will appreciate it! 

Something about myself:  I majoring in Mechanical Engineering in my undergraduate study, concentrating on robotics and control systems. I did some projects and researches about computer vision, auto-driving cars, and AI. All the following offers are in ME and concentrating on Robotics. In the future I still not make the the decision of if I want to go for a job or keep doing researches, but my financial condition is a little bit tight for the graduate tuition. To be specific, I can afford it with struggle. 

Here are my four choices:

1. MEng of UC Berkeley
2. M.S. of U-Michigan Ann Arbor
3. M.S. of Cornell
4. PHD of CMU (currently in the waitlist)

I know in the robotics field, the RI of CMU is one of the best in the US but I'm not sure if a ME PHD only concentrating on robotics is as good as totally robotics. Thus, if anyone know, please give me some information about this. Thanks!!!!!!

How bad is the physics program really?
I’m sorry if all these incoming freshman questions are annoying but I’ve been doing research on CMUs physics program since I applied and there seems to be conflicting opinions. I want to focus on astrophysics and I hope to go to grad school and I saw that some people think the physics department is really bad. Is this true?
--------------------------------------------------
How is the Finance recruiting scene at CMU?
Prospective Econ/Business student for the class of 2025 here. I’m interested in pursuing internship and club opportunities in finance at university, but haven’t been able to find much information on CMU’s resources in this regard. For reference I suppose I’m most interested in IB. I know that there’s the Tepper Finance Group which comprises 4 clubs, but aside from that I couldn’t find much on:
- how competitive club spots are. At the 1 other school I was admitted to (UCLA) I know they are extremely competitive there.
- what you do in the clubs
- placement of members into the various banks for internships every year

Would greatly appreciate anyone’s inputs on this!

Applying for housing alone (help)
Hi, does anyone have any info on my chances of getting the housing I want if I apply without a roommate group?  I'm thinking Resnik/West Wing, Fifth and Neville, or the new place but I have no idea how this will go.  I'm a current freshman btw.

&#x200B;

Should I try to find a roommate group? I'm very lost on this, so if anyone can give me any advice I'd appreciate it.

Should I accept the waitlist if I get off it?
Hi! I was placed on the waitlist for CMU and I’m currently accepted to the University of Southern California for Environmental Engineering. While i am not expecting to get off the waitlist, I want to decide ahead of time which school I would pick. I’ll be picking the priority waitlist (which isn’t binding but gives results sooner), but if I get off it, I need to make my decision and submit a deposit within 72 hours of that decision. I’ve gotten extremely attached to USC over the past 1.5-ish months of being accepted, but I want to consider my options as CMU is one of the top 5 engineering schools out there.

First, some details about USC: I am a recipient of a full tuition merit scholarship for USC as well as Viterbi Fellows, which gives me an additional 3K/year stipend for housing/food/books/travel, an undergrad research grant, special priority placements, and networking opportunities with the Dean of the engineering school.  I plan on going to grad school, so these opportunities are huge for boosting my chances. I would be considered top of my classes at USC because of the fellowship.

One thing I love about USC is their focus on interdisciplinary academics. I’m an avid actor and singer and wish to be part of many theatrical productions in college, and I am interested in topics like LGBTQ+ advocacy, environmentalism, and public policy. USC encourages engineering students to explore things outside of engineering, so this is perfect for my interests. 

As for CMU, I am slightly worried about 2021 being the first year to introduce the ENE undergraduate major, though they’ve had the masters program for a while. If anyone has insight on how good the masters program is, I’d appreciate it as I assume much of that will be translated to undergrad. I also heard that CMU is very major-focused, with students pursuing primarily engineering extracurriculars rather than taking an interdisciplinary route. Is this true? Will I have time to pursue these things, and would I be one of few engineering students who do so?

CMU has the stronger name brand within engineering and the higher ranked undergrad engineering programs (CMU 6 vs USC 29 or something like that). Given that I want to go to grad school to specialize within ENE, does this REALLY matter? Especially since I can do a 5-year masters at USC, whose engineering masters is ranked 10. With Viterbi Fellows, I can apply to the grad school early and would definitely have a higher chance of getting in due to all of the opportunities I can take advantage of in my undergrad.

The cost of each are similar (USC is slightly more unless they give me aid on top of my scholarship), so that is not a factor in my decision. CMU gave me lots of aid, though a scholarship is more consistent than financial aid. As a note, my language in this post is definitely biased towards USC because of the attachment I’ve made, but I can become attached to other schools like CMU if I feel they are better for me. Given that this subreddit will be biased towards CMU most likely, it balances out. I just want to be absolutely sure of my decision in the unlikely case that I need to make it.

Thanks in advance!

Edit: I value academics most, but also want to enjoy my college experience. I’m fine with being stressed as long as I think that it will benefit me to get through that stress. I’m not a partier like a lot of USC, but I do want a somewhat social life within clubs and orgs. I don’t want to feel like my free time is extremely limited.

VLSI/circuit design
Hi guys, prospective CMU ECE here.

Switching majors within CFA
Hello, I recently got admitted as architecture major in the college of fine arts. After I submitted my application to CMU, I realized that architecture major might not be financially suitable for me since I'm a low income student (the job itself, not the school-cmu gave me a lot of financial aid). I still have passion for architecture and art, but I still want to pursue a major that will get me a job right after I get my undergraduate degree. To earn a solid pay in architecture, I would need to get a licensure, start my own firm, and I'm not sure if my family could support me for >10 years from now (both financially and mentally).

I heard it's relatively easy to switch to Dietrich, but I was wondering if I could change my major to design. Is it easier because architecture majors are required to take drawing classes and are in the same college?

Prospective freshman questions about Institute for Politics and Strategy
Hi everyone! I've been admitted to CMU's Dietrich College (Institute for Politics and Strategy) as class of 2025. As this is a relatively new department and CMU seems to be more widely known as a science oriented school, I was having some trouble finding information about IPS online. 

If there are any IPS students here, how are you guys liking the school? Does CMU really have a culture of looking down on non-CS/engineering majors? Do you guys have anything to say about majoring in intl relations & politics or economics & politics? The Cybersecurity & Intl Conflict seemed so interesting, but also relatively new, so I was wondering what any of you guys thought about it from a student perspective. Finally any general advice or comments? 

I'm so sorry for the word vomit here, CMU is one of my top choices right now, and I've just been a bit anxious about this whole ordeal. Any advice or comments (even if you're not a Dietrich student) would be much appreciated, and thank you so much for taking the time to read this post!!

Study Opportunity
Hello! I’m a graduate student working on my Master’s project. My teammates and I have designed a sound-based virtual coworking platform and we're looking to evaluate its effectiveness and usability with undergrads and graduate students who have experience visiting public spaces with others around (libraries, coffee shops, etc.) to study or do their work.

If you're interested in volunteering, you will participate in a two-part research study. The two sessions will take place on separate days, and each session will last up to 1.5 hours max. You will be asked to complete three different tasks while using the virtual coworking space and a comparable system. With your permission, we will also ask you to take a screen recording and screenshots while using our system for a small portion of the session. At the end, you will answer questions about your experience with using our system.

We expect to enroll up to 20 participants for this study. Participants will be compensated $15 for the first session and $20 for the second session, totaling $35 for the entire study. Compensation will be provided in the form of an Amazon gift card. If you or someone you know is interested in participating in this research project, please complete this 3-minute eligibility survey: [https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_5yCsTWmulgjXkWi](https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5yCsTWmulgjXkWi)

Please only respond if you can commit to attending both sessions.

Any advice for an incoming Grad student?
Joining CMU in the fall, never been to any uni in sates. Is there anything at all you think I should know about before coming (Need not be related to uni per se - even advice about the city like places to stay and places to avoid is also welcomed)? 

Also, how is the social scene for grad students?? I have heard that CMU is not a very social uni and that is cool - I am not either, but I don't want to be an absolute loner in a foreign country. In my undergrad, there wasn't really any divide between grads and undergrads i.e. same events and parties for everyone. Is it the same for CMU?

Can I switch my major before enrolling?
I applied to mcs as a physics major and was accepted for that, however in between the time of applying and now, I’ve realized I’m more invested in data science. I wish I applied to Dietrich for StatML, is there anyway I can contact an advisor to see if I can switch before going to cmu in the fall? Or do I have to stick with physics and attempt to transfer later down the line?
Any help is appreciated!

Freshmen Housing
Hi, as an incoming freshman I am going to be applying for housing soon and I really like Mudge and Morewood gardens and I was wondering if anyone has any experiences or photos they could share? also I am probably going to go for a single room (is that a bold move as a freshmen?) or will I still make friends easily (I am a pretty social person but my parents just want me to get a single because of covid and since I am going to be an international student they are kinda scared for first year)

CMU Tepper or UVA McIntire?
Hello, I am really struggling with deciding between Tepper or mcintire! I am a resident of va so tuition would be much less at UVA than CMU. 

They both seem to offer a lot for finance and are highly ranked. At UVA there seems to be more school spirit for sports but at CMU there is more of a city setting. 

I would like to hear what others think? My goal is to get the best education but also have free time for myself to be happy and enjoy college.

Prospective (biomedical?) engineering student wondering about workload and difficulty of classes
Hi! I got into CMU for engineering (I think I may be interested in doing biomedical engineering). I come from a rural high school with a weak background in biology (I and II, but I learned very little in level I) and average background in math (calc AB) and chem (I and II). I just was wondering if I'm expected to go into any first-year classes with substantial prior knowledge about these subjects. Also, to anyone who is pursuing biomedical engineering, do you find the workload to be manageable? How difficult is it to do well in your classes? Also are there any harsh grading curves/grade deflation practices at CMU? What are the professors like in this department? What does career counseling/advising look like at CMU?

Sorry if this post is all over the place, I'm just feeling really overwhelmed and scared about my future rn. Also I come from a small school where it was easy for me to do well so I feel like I'm gonna fail the minute I step into the real world :')
--------------------------------------------------
How do you guys like CMU?
I just got waitlisted at CMU for Tepper which was quite a shock because, to be honest, I was 99.9% sure I would be rejected. Because I had basically no expectations for potentially actually getting in, I haven't really done any research into what the school is like.

I already paid my enrollment deposit at IU Kelley, but now I want to do some more research into CMU on the off chance I get in. These two schools seem to have vastly different cultures, and since I can't really visit right now to get a feel, I wanted to see what your guys' thoughts are on Tepper's/CMU's culture.

Are students really competitive? Collaborative? How is the social scene (not necessarily greek life, but clubs and that kinda thing)? What is your favorite/least favorite thing about CMU?

Feel free to respond to none/all/any questions not listed here, I'm just trying to get a general feel for what the school is like. Thanks!

Is touring worth it during the pandemic?
I’m nearly certain that I want to go to CMU, and while touring before committing is a common recommendation, I’m not sure if it would be worth the hassle. If this were normal times, I’d feel differently; I’d love to see the dorm options firsthand, sit in on a class or two, and talk to current students. But as it stands, it seems like all I’d be able to do is walk around outside and look at the buildings, which I doubt will change my opinions in any significant way.

So I’d love to know, what could I expect to get out of touring CMU right now? Would you recommend it? Anything interesting happening on campus this month that I could plan a visit around?

Thanks so much!

Help regarding ECE
Hey guys,
I applied for the ECE major in CMU. However, I am looking to work/ study in the electrical energy generation field. I do enjoy programming but that’s not something that I would necessarily want to pursue a career in. I would be grateful if any ECE students could tell me how their experience was in ECE. Did you find it stressful? Did the course lean more towards either Electrical or Computer Engineering or does that depend on the modules you take? I did hear that the course focused a lot of cyber tech. Is that true? Or do you think I’m better off doing just Electrical Engineering at some other uni? How did you find the internship/ co-op opportunities to be? Was the job placement good? 

Any help much appreciated :)

Meeting with my AO!!
Hi everyone! I was accepted to the school of engineering as a member of the class of 2025. Along with my decision letter, I also got my financial aid notification and sadly it isn't enough for my family to be able to afford. 

Since I really do want to attend, I emailed my admissions officer explaining all the reasons I want to go and why I need more aid, and she set up a zoom meeting for us to talk about it on Friday! 

I was wondering if anyone on this sub has ever set up a meeting like this with their AO before committing? If so, what sort of questions did your AO ask? Was it more interview style or more conversational? 

Also, has anyone successfully negotiated their aid to get more? If so, what sort of tactics worked for you?

Any help is greatly appreciated!

Looking to improve my tennis game
I'm an intermediate player in tennis and haven't played in a while. Now that the weather is becoming better, I wanted to take some tennis lessons. Does CMU have any tennis instructors? If not, any recommendations on outside tennis instructors in Pittsburgh?

Also, is there a recreational tennis club at CMU? I joined the CMU Tennis Club on Bridge last semester but I haven't got any response and the Bridge profile still shows "Membership pending" for me.

Is Tepper worth it?
Hi! I was recently accepted into the Tepper school of business and was overjoyed!! I plan on majoring in finance in hopes of working on Wall Street! I’ve heard great things about Tepper and it’s ranked very well. I just toured the campus this past week and it feels depressing (IK covid plays a role in this). I’ve been lurking this subreddit and keep reading how CMU is depressing and the atmosphere is competitive. I’ve also researched about the school and it comes up as #3 most depressed student bodies. The only good thing I’ve heard about CMU is the academics and I can’t seem to think of anything else. The food was awful, the city doesn’t have a lot to do, students are unhappy, and not to mention it’s 80k just for the “prestige.” I know it won’t be easy at the school but my worst fear is being depressed while having to pay a lot for it. I’ve been accepted to one of my state schools, Virginia Tech and can do a double major there in four years and walk on with AP/DE credit. I’ve also toured tech numerous times and it’s so lively with football games and a great student atmosphere. I also keep coming back to the point that no matter where you go you can be successful if you work hard and still end up in the same place. I felt so upset when I toured and the school didn’t live up to my expectations because I had such high hopes for the school considering it is ranked so well. I want to hear other people’s opinions while I’m making my final decision on what to do.

For those who have done or know about the ECE IMB program, what are the pros and cons of doing it in either Pittsburgh or Silicon Valley? I'm trying to decide where I should do it or if it even makes a difference?
--------------------------------------------------
Help trying to schedule my path
So, they announced ECE won't be restricted this year and I am now an ECE major(freshman). One problem is, I haven't taken 112 yet. So, I'm really hoping to get an internship for next summer, and I've heard a lot of upperclassmen telling me I should get one too. Since I am a little behind in courses than other ECE majors, I was thinking of taking concepts over the summer. However, now thinking abt it, if i wanna apply for internships in the fall, ill prolly need programming experience by the time I apply. Ive never had any coding experience, and I'm trying to focus on computer architecture. My question is
1. Anyone know what the requirements/interviews for hardware side companies are? 
2. Whats like the timeline for applying to internships and interviews?
3. Should I take 112 over the summer instead of concept (I don't have coding experience) and 122 this fall and grind leetcode for potentially a swe internship?
4. Just try to find a research if possible (would be great if I can get some info abt profs or labs doing research in computer architecture)
I already see ppl taking 122 as freshman this sem, and I really don't wanna fall behind and be the one doing nothing next summer... it'll be great if I can get some help...

So hard to do well in this school
I literally just can’t. I put fucking every day studying and getting an A in any course for me is pretty much impossible. I’ll always be fighting to not get a C and do shit on HWs. 

I literally go to OH and study so much. This school is so ducking demotivating. I literally am drowning. I can’t even get enough sleep, sometimes I get sleepy and sleep for 1 minute during lecture.

It feels like everyone else can aim for As, people around me work less than me and do better . I am just so done and all I see is people complaining that they got a B. Meanwhile if I get a B it’s a good day for me, I could never imagine the feeling of an A :(

I also can’t with the people that ALWAYS talk about grades and compare scores. Such a fucking competitive school like why do you care about my grade???? I just hope when I graduate I don’t have to deal with this shit again coz this school is toxic and will make you drown until you graduate

Like is it just me? When I have fucking vacations I am doing physically so well. My body is in shape I don’t feel tired. Then I come to CMU my body is literally fucking shit, I’m always tired even if I sleep and everything’s fucking trash. Food is fucking depressing man, like wtf is this shit. There’s literally no good places on campus and they closed Resnik and other decent places and decided to open a place called ducking Beefsteak which ironically only served veggies.

Can we also talk about how everyone tries to act smart? Like sometimes I’m collaborating with people and people genuinely act smart and not try to explain well in purposes as if I’m retarded. Like I’m sorry I’m not as smart as you? Like tf? Like why does everyone here feel the need of being smarter than the other one? Honestly for any incoming student I would say if you don’t like people who only talk about grades and academics don’t come here because this always happens to me: At the beginning I can cope it but 3/4 of the semester in I can’t stand CMU. It’s p much a shit place at that point and am counting the days until I go home.

Can anyone tell me what’s so fucking good about this school? I honestly think if I had gone to another school I would be so much better off. Don’t even think it’s worth the effort.

Should i reach out to Swim coach for recruiting
 

Hi,

I got waitlisted for CMU .I have been a varsity swimmer with pretty good times and wondering if i should reach out to the CMU swim coach to see if my chances of getting in improves with that ?

Financial Aid Possibility
I recently was admitted to the Mellon College of Science but didn't send in my financial aid documents (excluding FAFSA) before February 15th. Does that basically make me ineligible for financial aid as this school would be a really good opportunity for me but if I cant lower the price I can't attend.
--------------------------------------------------
toured today, gsa racist?
i'm on spring break visiting grandparents and i toured cmu (it's definitley in my top 3 schools atm)- a little underwhelming with all of the buildings closed, but it was a nice experience and it got me kinda pumped for college. 

on that fence y'all paint, there was something about a "GSA racist"? I know anyone can paint on it but what was that about? (I'm a lesbian, if it's something about a gay-straight alliance I'd like to know that)
--------------------------------------------------
Is it worth getting in from a waitlist at CMU?
I'm worried that if I end up getting into Carnegie because I got in from the waitlist I won't be able to keep up with the academic rigor of the courses there. 

I'd love it if some of you guys who got in from CMU's waitlist can chime in and let me know how you ended up doing academically once you were accepted.
--------------------------------------------------
Update??
Hey y’all. Any idea about the mode of teaching for fall 21? (Masters students)
My graduate advisor won’t respond so had to resort to reddit. :(
Can we defer our admits in case it’s gonna be online?

Cross Registration Concerns
Hey guys! Pitt Engineering Student here.

I need to take one (maybe two) CMU engineering classes this **fall,** and I noticed your academic calendar says "registration week" is in June (7-11)??? If I can't get into a certain materials class (27503), then I need to take it at Pitt over the summer (which is not good for my schedule). Pitt's summer add-drop ends May 21, so I can't register for the summer class and drop it in time. The is all time critical because I am graduating in the fall.

Can someone confirm that I can't register for a fall class at CMU before June? For my fall classes at Pitt, I already registered a week ago.

Edit: I have emailed my advisors, and haven't heard back, so I am trying to figure this out on my own.
--------------------------------------------------
Feasibility of part-time internship + 122 over the summer?
Has anyone taken 122 over the summer recently while also managing a part-time commitment? My summer internship's part-time policy is minimum 15hrs/week and assuming 122's summer FCE of 25hrs/week is accurate, 40hrs/week over the summer sounds not ideal but doable. 

However, I get that this is 122 we're talking about and it's probably barely survivable on its own over the summer so I just wanted other people to let me know if I'm completely underestimating summer 122.

My advisor recommended me either push 122 off to the fall or give part-time+122 a try for a week and see if I can stay alive and I'm leaning towards the second option since having 122 done by the fall would make my future semesters a lot better. They also suggested against cutting my time with my internship short for the sake of future references, etc.

I'd appreciate other people's input on this, thanks.

Research Across Majors & As A 1st/2nd Year
Hey! I just got admitted to CIT and am planning to pursue MSE. I am especially interested in doing research on renewable energy or biomaterials for environmental applications. 

As I have done research on the programs at CMU, I have noticed that there are many different majors and programs that seem to have renewables/energy research opportunities. Are there programs that only certain majors can participate in? Or do research groups have fairly open recruitment across majors?

Also: how difficult is it to get involved in research as a freshman or sophomore? What does that typically look like as an underclassman?

Thank you in advance! I am currently debating between CMU and UW Seattle, so I want to be as informed as possible :D
--------------------------------------------------
Are there any scales on campus besides the ones in the gym?
If not, which ones are the most accessible and which gyms are the least popular? As in, I don’t need to go far into the gym in order to use it and there aren’t huge crowds of people. Idk where any of the scales are in the gyms on campus, and I need to measure my weight for the COVID vaccine :’)
--------------------------------------------------
What are your thoughts on the Clyde House?
I was accepted to CMU last Saturday and I’ve been reading  about housing for incoming freshman. I found the “Clyde House” on the housing website and it seems like a really good option. I like the fact that it’s actually a house for 24 people. Since I haven’t had the chance to tour the university yet, I wanted to know what was your opinion on the Clyde House?
--------------------------------------------------
Is this school really worth the 80k price tag?
I recently got admitted into CMU for engineering, but I’m having a hard time deciding wether it really is worth it for me to splurge 320k over 4 years for undergrad, when I’m planning to go to grad school anyways, where I think prestige would matter more. I already got accepted into my state school (University of Maryland), and it’s already pretty good in engineering and it’s only 27k a year. I’ve tried to see if CMU would consider giving me any financial aid, but it seems that they won’t budge. I understand that this is a T4 school for engineering, but is this so called “prestige” gonna get me any further in life? I understand that it’s not about the college you go to, but what you make of it, and I’m definitely planning to go all out when I go to college. Is CMU truly worth it for this much money?

2021 FALL
Hi everyone, I was admitted to MS program at CMU 2021 Fall, but I was hesitating about this offer, since MS was relatively short compared to undergraduate and Ph.D. and I don't want to waste my money and time having online classes. When can school decide the mode of 2021 Fall? Thanks.

Opinions on the Entertainment Technology Center
Hi! I was recently admitted to the ETC and I'd love to hear your opinions on the program. Why did you choose the ETC/CMU? What's the best part? What's the worst part? If you've already graduated, how have your job prospects been? Anything else that you wish you knew when you were making your decision? Thanks!!
--------------------------------------------------
Quantum Computing at CMU
Hello, I was wondering if CMU is involved with Quantum Computing research at all? I'm talking more on the theoretical/algorithms side rather than the physics/EE side.

I can't find anyone involved in this area that isn't associated with the physics department. If there are any researchers, I would love to hear about them!
--------------------------------------------------
touring campus?
hi! i'm visiting my grandparents in Pittsburgh for spring break (grandpa's a cmu alum, i'm from denver, colorado) and i'm going to be visiting campus tomorrow or the day after (29th or 30th). i'm SO excited, cmu is my second top school atm (university of toronto first) and I've been researching colleges for months now.

I think we'll go to phipps after (both grandparents are master gardeners) and my grandpa wants to show me some things, but does anyone know of pretty/photogenic/important spots to hit up, especially to get the feel for the campus? I'm assuming I can't really go in places bc covid but would there be anywhere I could see the inside of? I'm interested in biology btw.

I'm actually so excited, I love Pittsburgh weather (I know, right? I love rain/dreary days and my lungs are too weak for Colorado altitude) and I've been zooming around on google street view for months leading up to this. no, i do not have a social life, thanks for asking.

edit: a little underwhelming with all of the buildings closed, but it was a nice experience. y'all are so quiet lol. also question- on that fence y'all paint, there was something about a "GSA racist"? I know anyone can paint on it but what was that about? (I'm a lesbian, if it's something about a gay-straight alliance I'd probably like to know that)
--------------------------------------------------
Question about the Social Scene
do the cs majors here lead fulfilling social lives? my top 2 choices right now are cmu and berkeley, and i know berkeley cs is also notorious for having a lot of shut-ins and whatnot, but i'll have a lot of friends i already know going to berkeley so i feel like the social life will be fine

do people interact with each other and go out together and all that stuff at cmu (even within cs)?
--------------------------------------------------
Moving out of Dorms Experience
Hey CMU! 

**What is your moving-out experience at CMU?** At Rice, it is very unorganized, wasteful, and frustrating. We are a team trying to optimize our process. Our Design For America team is working with H&D on more sustainable move-in and move-out procedures. 

This is a quick survey to see how other similar colleges organize move-out. [https://forms.gle/DGSsJzW62vGe9MvT6](https://forms.gle/DGSsJzW62vGe9MvT6)

&#x200B;

**Or just comment in the thread on some things you think CMU does well and is sustainable or is a real pain in the ass when it's time to move out of your dorms.**

For instance, Rice does a freecycle at the end of the year, but it is super unorganized, people just pile their unwanted trash there and nobody is really interested in picking up items there. 

Also, a lot of large items (i.e. couches, lamps, fridges etc.) get trashed at the end of the year because we have to empty out our rooms and there's no convenient or affordable place to store them over the summer.
--------------------------------------------------
Where should I go to College
 

I have recently been very fortunate to get into all of my top schools for Electrical Engineering. I got into Ut Austin, Georgia Tech, and Carnegie Mellon. I want to focus on energy systems and renewable and sustainable energy. I don’t know many people who go to any of these schools, so if any of y’all could offer insights, that would be a huge help. Down below, I just have some pros and cons for each school.

Ut Austin

Pros:

* I would enter in with enough Ap credit to essentially make me a sophomore
* Austin is a fantastic City
* Large Alumni network
* Balanced student body

Cons:

* Very far away from home
* Less prestigious
* Hard to change major
* Large classes

Georgia Tech

Pros:

* Highest ranked Electrical engineering program
* I can get my masters in 5 years
* Offers a concentration in sustainable energy
* most afordable

Cons:

* High Male to female ratio, I am a girl, so I worry about misogyny and whatnot.
* Pretty much everyone, there is engineering, so not a lot of student body diversity.
* Far away

Carnegie Mellon

Pros:

* Very prestigious
* Highest paid graduates 100k+
* Best career connections
* Close to home
* Best female to male ratio

Cons:

* No focus on sustainable energy
* Most expensive
* I don’t like the campus as much

Thanks for helping!

Course notes for Principles of Functional Programming
Is there any way I can get a PDF of the course notes?

I see course notes available online here: [https://www.studocu.com/en-us/course/carnegie-mellon-university/principles-of-functional-programming/433017](https://www.studocu.com/en-us/course/carnegie-mellon-university/principles-of-functional-programming/433017)

But this site charges $23.97 to download the course notes, which isn't right. I'd happily pay that to buy a book, but not to download the free course notes.

Advice on 21241
Hi,

I'm planning to take 21241 during summer and I hope I can get realistic advice or how is it like to take it during summer!

I think the  professor is Xu for summer and I've done great with multivariable analysis but not so good with concepts.

Considering my mathematical background as this,  I wonder how would the course be like and how hard would it be to get a good grade?

Thank you so much in advance!
--------------------------------------------------
Small Rant on 15213
Just failed the fuck out the 213 midterm ;_;. I felt like I've been doing pretty well in the class, and my grade is actually still kinda high just because the midterm is worth so little, but it feels kinda conflicting when u score so much below the mean and the mean was quite high. One of the questions was particularly harsh, since the parts of the question depend on the first part, so if u missed the first part, that was an immediate 10% off of the final score. Idk, maybe I should've just studied more...

CMU Architecture Programs
Hello! I was just admitted to CMU to study in the school of Architecture and I know there are two programs (the 5-year and 4-year programs). I've seen some work from the 5-year program but none from the 4-year and can't really decide between the two. From what I understand the 5-year is best if you want a fast track to becoming a traditional architect and the 4-year is more interdisciplinary? I originally applied looking to be in the 4-year program (because I go to an art magnet school currently and think I could enjoy the chance to make my work more artistic/sculptural) but I also see the appeal in getting the 5-year degree and starting a serious career. If anybody has some insight about the different programs and the differences between them I'd really appreciate it :)

How hard is it to double major in ECE and BME?
So I was just accepted to CoE today. I'm interested in majoring BME on a neuroengineering track, and choose my first major as ECE. But I'm a little concerned that ECE is too hard for me to handle both of them, and I notice most BME students choose CE as their first major. Any advice, please?

Edit: CE I mean chemical engineering

ai vs cs major
I'm currently trying to decide which major I wanted to choose and hoped some of you might be able to weigh in? originally I thought I'd choose ai no doubt (given that I got in ofc) but I'm wavering a little bit now. the ai mini was fine in terms of difficulty but I found most of the concepts a little uninteresting at least at the level we were learning them and the computations all seemed extremely tedious. those of you who are in ai currently, is the work at higher levels similar to this, i.e. a lot of algorithms/math/probability? does it ever get more "hands-on"?
--------------------------------------------------
CMU vs Virginia Tech CDP (Electrical/Computer engineering)
 

Hey guys, I'm having a very hard time deciding between these two schools for electrical & computer engineering. Of course, I'm so grateful to have this problem in the first place,

For some context, Calhoun Discovery Program (CDP) is a program at Virginia Tech that gives me a full-tuition (not full ride, i still have to pay for housing and fees) scholarship and access to industry projects (CAT, Boeing, GE) for all four years of college. I also get a 2.5k stipend every year for "experimental learning" (Study abroad, research, etc.). Here's my pros and cons list for both schools. I'll put two comments, one for VT and one for CMU, and you can upvote the school you would pick if you were me.

**Virginia Tech.**

*PROS:*

\- more social student body 

\- beautiful campus.

\- nature! (i love nature).

\- very good price (I'll pay 30-50k after 4 years for housing).

\- slightly more of a culture fit.

\- best food in the nation.

\-students seem happier.

*CONS:*

\- lower average salary in my major (\~70k for EE, \~80-90k for CPE).

\- less companies I like recruit from VT

\- less prestige, less prestige in my major (#15-20 for EE and CE, Doesn't really matter too much because I'm in engineering)

\- being in the middle of nowhere means I could get bored sometimes maybe.

\- very narrow specialty in engineering.

**Carnegie Mellon.**

*PROS:*

\- thicc average salary (\~100k. although most students go to software & computer hardware which are more lucrative so the numbers are swayed).

\- companies like AMD, NVIDIA, etc. recruit that don't in VT. I will probably go into some hardware engineering role, or maybe embedded systems; however, if I go into something more traditionally EE like Radio Frequency or PCB design then there isn't much of a salary benefit to CMU.

\-Lots of stuff to do in Pittsburgh.

\-Lots of companies recruit from California and I'd love to live in Cali for a bit after college.

\-More prestige in my major (#1 CPE, #6 EE)

\-Really cool curriculum for ECE.

\- Really cool data science curriculum. I like data science and might take a few statml courses because it's interesting.

\- Cooler extracurriculars/engineering project teams.

*CONS:*

\- More "nerdy". Not a complete con, but I think VT would push me to become social a bit more and I'd be able to grow out of my shell more.

\- expensive. (\~90k total after four years when factoring in tuition increases and potential income increases in my family. I'm not getting any help so I have to pay all of it.)

\- Intense workload & stress culture. Not a huge con for me as I think I can manage stress well, but it's something to note.

\- no nature : (.

\- hard to change majors.

I'm having an extremely tough time deciding between these two amazing options. As of right now, I'm leaning slightly towards VT because of the price, but the prestige and opportunities that CMU offers is really hard to turn down. I'd like to hear some input  from cmu students : ).

CMU Tepper vs Georgia Tech CS
I am grateful I got in to both places. While Tepper is a semi-target for business, I would need to get a double major in CS or math to break into quant finance Hedge fund industry. CMU SCS and business is a more powerful combo but CS at GT is guaranteed. My dream has been working in the QF hedge fund industry and Tepper has a BCSF program which allows u to enter in with the requirements. I really don't know where to go. Should I take the risk and go somewhere harder or take the easier route. Or I could go to Tepper and get an OMSCS at GT and break in. What do y'all think?

waitlisted at CMU MCS but rejected for CoE
hey guys! i’m a current senior and i just got my decision for undergrad RD.


so i have the decision to do a priority or regular waiting list. i didn’t get in for my first top (engineering) which really sucks but got waitlisted for my second major in science. i’m really confused bc i want to go to CMU but i also want to know how hard it is to switch majors and go to different colleges in CMU. i want to switch my major if i decide to go to CMU to biomedical engineering. 

so how hard is it to switch majors once ur in CMU? can i still become a BME even if i wasn’t admitted as one? and how does the priority or regular decision work?

idk what to do lol

I am a current undergraduate majoring in computational neuroscience that wants to take some time to explore some hardware-oriented classes that would (vaguely) relate to neuroscience (reminiscent of neural engineering stuff). Does anyone have any recommendations? The only courses I've seen on the BME curriculum would be Neural Data Analysis and Neural Signal Processing, but there's nothing related to a hardware aspect of neural engineering that I could find (that's why I'm looking for hardware experiences in general in addition to neural-engineering related courses).

Physics 2 Over Summer
So CMU rejected a course from another school that had credits for the same course and now I’m stuck taking Physics 2 through CMU. I was wondering how Klein is and how the workload/how busy the course is over the summer?

Scholarships for international students
Hi! I received an admit from CMU, I am pretty excited for the journey ahead and wanted to know if CMU provides any (merit) scholarships to international graduate students for a masters program? 


Would I be okay if I ask my program advisor for some funding/ scholarships ?  


Thankyou

Concepts over the summer?
I'm thinking of taking a class over the summer if I get into ECE. My advisor recommended either 15112 or concepts, but personally, since I do not prior programming experience, concepts seems a lil better. Has anyone taken concepts over the summer? I think I won't have a problem graduating on time even if I don't, but if I want a cs minor, I think I'll have to take smth this summer to catch up.

thoughts on luxury apartments
Internship just got moved virtually, so instead of moving to california for the summer, I'm going to be moving back to Pittsburgh for the summer (and the fall semester in-person hopefully).

Thoughts on splurging for the $1300+ luxury apartments like skyvue? Anyone living in these places have thoughts on whether it's worth it or not? Bonus if you have suggestions for places

Advice on Apartments for Fall 2021 Semester?
Hi,

I am an incoming CMU student for the Fall 2021 semester in graduate school. Any advice for apartments and where to look/finding roommates? I hope I am not too late looking for a place to live for the 2021-2022 academic year. I have never been to Pittsburgh, so any advice would be greatly appreciated! If you can please let me know, I would greatly appreciate it!

Thanks, guys! :)

Switch from Chemistry to Econ as incoming freshman?
Hi! So I was accepted into MCS for chemistry so I’m class of ‘25, but after more consideration I don’t think I want to major in it anymore. I like the subject, but it seems too much work for a topic I don’t really really love. I feel really stupid and disappointed in myself for not thinking it over more like I should have. My goals have changed. 

I want to major in Economics and i know that’s in Dietrich-Tepper. How hard would it be to transfer? I heard it can be pretty difficult to transfer across schools like SCS and CIT considering they are very competitive. How soon should I talk to an advisor about it? Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------
This school is not what I thought it would be (rant)
I’m an MS ECE student who has sped run their degree to complete in two semesters, which is all fun and games until I have teachers that don’t care to help their students. 

Im being proactive, starting homework’s on the day they’re released, reaching out to TA’s, trying to get the help I need to complete the assignments but the TAs either don’t care or are too busy to bother, almost every piazza post (not just mine, everyone’s) goes unanswered for at least a day, and when they finally do respond, it takes another day to get another response for a follow up!! The teachers aren’t available either, they show up to class, teach, and then don’t interact with their students outside of that. Heck, in one class the teacher doesn’t even know what the actual assignment he assigned us is. I’m trying so hard to get everything done, and not fall behind. Trying to get everything done early, but because there is no help realistically available, an assignment that should take a few days at most, is taking over a week, throwing me and others either so close to the deadline or past the deadline having to use a grace day. 

I’m so sick of trying to get help and having my questions go unanswered, I’m so sick of stressing about assignments longer than needed because of it. I’m so sick of this school. I’ve never felt so stressed and depressed in my life, all I want is to get my work done and get out of here but HOW am I supposed to do that when faculty don’t even bother to help the students. 

Every day I just want to quit but I know if I do that I’ll just end up having to take another semester of classes in this hell hole and do it all over again.

Maybe it’s just the classes I happen to take this semester, but this is not how I thought CMU would be.
--------------------------------------------------
When is the ideal deadline?
Many aspects of an assignment are derived from the *day and hour* it is due, such as the timeframe in which the majority of labor is performed.

If something is due at 12 AM, I am working on that lab/essay/problem set through dinner and the late evening.

If something is due at 12 PM, I may skip morning lecture from another class if needed.

If something is due at 5 PM, I might not do anything else beyond working for that morning and afternoon.

This begs the question: what day of the week and hour should assignments be due?

Some general observations:

-	Many classes assign deadlines at 12 PM, so further congesting rush hour may prove inefficient.
-	Weekend deadlines are in violation of the Geneva Convention.
-	Early morning deadlines are presumably designed to prevent people from taking up an additional evening, but likely have the side effect of inducing all-nighters the day before.

My working assumption is that students exhibit rational behavior and therefore conform to a [just-in-time labor scheme.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_manufacturing) I am also assuming students observe Pittsburgh time.

Thank you for participating in my dissertation.

36225/226 vs 21325
I’m trying to decide which of these I should take over the summer and was wondering which people usually choose? from the sound of earlier posts 325 is harder so I’m inclined to go the easier route with 225 lol but at the same time I don’t want to potentially disadvantage myself by missing out on important (though difficult) concepts in 325.. if anyone has any input or experience with these classes please lmk!!

Should I take 21-122 if I have AP credit?
I need to take 3D Calc or Multivariate Calc later and I have AP calc credit but I've forgotten much of calculus and haven't thought about it in about 2 years. Should I just take 21-122 over the summer or is it not worth it? I don't want to be lost in 3D/Multi Calc later.

I am interested in storytelling and drawing. Is there a specific course/major/minor/interdisciplinary major that has these elements?

I hate this school
I hate this school. Classes are fucking hard for no reason. I used to have plans and dreams for my life. Everyday, I do my stupid fucking shit classes and hate everything. I feel genuinely hopeless. I’m stressed as fuck. And for what? Go work a job I hate? Honestly, it’s all one giant ass shit show. 

But of course, I’m too much of a coward to leave! And what else would I do with my life, I’m worthless and dumb here, but at least I can give the illusion that I have some sort of measly fucking plan for my life. If I leave, I’m a lazy entitled asshole who didn’t try hard enough. But I did fucking try!!! I’m just useless, apparently. Not that it would fucking matter to you anyway cmu, or anyone for that matter. 

Everything is so disappointing. I wish I could redo my whole fucking life.

Which undergrad should one choose for masters in computer science(artificial intelligence)?
Hello, I'm going to Rutgers, NJ. Currently confused between Math and Computer science or Electrical engineering and Computer engineering. I wanna come to CMU for my master. Which undergrad combinations is suitable and desired ?

I'll also be working on many side projects with my major like, CompTIA certs, competitive programing and few cloud cert.
--------------------------------------------------
CMU ECE Pittsburgh
I got accepted to CMU ECE for 2021Fall MS at Pittsburgh campus. My desire study area is doing something like analog / RF IC, or Mixed-signal IC things like that. I know CMU is pretty dedicated towards CS stuff or just anything with programming. I have been browsing the CMU ECE website, and the only professors that conduct research in related areas are Prof. Rick Carley (anyone knows if he is retired yet ?) , Prof Venessa Chen, and Professor  Larry Pileggi. 

CMU has a lot of research positions for people who enjoy coding. but if I want to do analog IC related research such as A/D converter, D/A converter, high speed RF IC ( VCO, PLL, CDR , mixer), DC-DC converter, things like that

**So overall, I am still wondering how is the ECE program there in terms of professors, research, courses and job opportunities if I study analog / RF / Mixed-signal IC.**  

You answers to me will be invaluable. Plz be as specific as possible.

Does undergrad uni matter if I’m applying for a competitive grad program?
Hey so I’m thinking about going to a state school that has no prestige and it’s not well known either (university if Idaho) to get my bachelors. My plan is to get my bachelors there and then apply for cmu’s MHCI program. However, how competitive is this program? Would it matter that I went to a less known school? Would my chances be higher if I went to a prestige school like Purdue?

Tuition Question for Late Semester Add/Drop
So I'm in an elective class this semester that turned out to be pretty bad. I won't go into it, but the professor simply is not holding up their end of the bargain and the class has done next to nothing worthwhile. I've been able to arrange another class where the professor would let me in this late and have an accelerated assignment schedule to do all the necessary work. My advisor agrees with the plan and with the COVID class waiver I can drop the current course with no repurcussions.  


I know I probably need to talk to HUB people, but does anybody know if switching the classes will increase my tuition at all? If it helps, I will be transferring from a class outside of my department into my department.

Thanks

Getting GenEds done over the summer
 I'm an incoming freshman in Dietrich. Has anyone taken classes at a local community college and gotten credit for it? Other posts say I would have to talk to my advisor but since I'm a prospective student I don't know when we would get set up with one. Is there anyone on this sub that I can talk to regarding the whole process of getting credit for GenEds at a local CC?

MSHCA program
Hello, I recently got accepted to the MSHCA program at the Heinz College and I’m just looking for some people who are in the program or alums. I understand it’s fairly new, but I want to know what people’s experiences have been like. How are the professors? What did you like/not like? Would you recommend any tips? What opportunities did you receive (job or otherwise)? I’m really excited about getting in but I’m just nervous about actually going 😅

How did people find mentors for SURF?
Yes I know that the deadline for SURF is in under 2 weeks, so I don't plan to apply. At any rate I'm curious about how people found mentors. Did you already have a good relationship with a prof or did you cold email, look at faculty listings in the related field and see their past research or something, things like that. I just assume that professors are busy and would rather not have anything to do with unknown students.

Hey all, is anyone aware of or currently in active outreach programs for CS?

Can I transfer from the SV campus to Pittsburgh?
I got into CMU SV and before I thought it was a good choice because its close to home and I won't have to move, but I am visiting the Pittsburgh campus and am attracted to go there. Is it easy to transfer campuses? I spoke to the program manager and she said you can apply after one semester but it is not guaranteed at admission. Any one done it before? 

I am in MS ECE btw.

15411 (Compiler Design) What language ?
I am planning to take 15411 (Compiler Design) next fall, and I'd like to start preparing. I was wondering what the best programming language is for this course. I was thinking scala + fastparse library but the course [website](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~janh/courses/411/18/resources.html) says:

>\[...\] we strongly discourage the use of Scala due to efficiency issues.

Why do they say that? Scala is super fast. Are they talking about the Scala standard parser combinator library? Or by "efficiency issues" do they mean that it is too fast and would be cheating? And if they are right, what is the best language?

Should food be a factor in considering colleges
Just wondering cause I'm scrolling through some posts and a nontrivial number of them mention bad food (+meal plan issues). Is that something to consider for choosing your colleges (if I get accepted, prob won't :(( ). Like can it make or break your day/affect your mood. Might sound dumb but I'm a big foodie. If it really sucks can I cook meals myself in freshman apts?

Is Accepting an Offer Binding?
Hello. I have been accepted into the MRSD program, and I'm super excited! It's definitely one of my top choices. However, I am also waiting to hear back from several other universities. I have to send my response (accept or reject) by March 25th. Another university I'm waiting to hear back from will release its decision on March 25th, and another will release its decision on April 1st. If I accept the acceptance letter, is that binding? What're the repercussions if I accept and then change my mind? The offer letter says there is a non-refundable tuition deposit; is the only thing I'll lose if I change my mind that, or are there other consequences?

Apartment Advice
Hello CMU students! 

I will be moving to CMU with my girlfriend in the beginning of Fall / end of summer 2021. I have been searching for 1b/1b apartments close to CMU and have a shortlist, and it would be great if I can get  information / your comments about my shortlist on the following parameters 

1. walking distance -- all my shortlisted apartments are within 45 minutes walk according to google maps, but let me know if there is any catch (such as diversions due to construction etc. that I should know about). 
2. safety -- ideally it would be nice if the streets have good lighting and are not too deserted in the evenings.  
3. noise -- I read in some reviews that there are train tracks near some apartments which make a lot of noise. If you know any such factors about these apartments please let me know. Since both of us will be busy with research, we would like to avoid such apartments. 
4. grocery stores -- this is not very important as we mostly use instacart; but let us know if there are good grocery stores within walking distance for smaller errands. We don't eat outside, so proximity to restaurants /cafes is not an issue. 
5. general info: anything about how the management treat the tenants, whether the buildings are well maintained, how thin the walls are; or anything else you have to share. I am mainly looking for information based on experience that is not available on the apartment websites. 

Here are my shortlisted apartments. If you have any other recommendation please feel free to add: 

* [Schnley Apartments](https://www.apartments.com/schenley-apartments-pittsburgh-pa/h2wzm10/)
* [New King Edward](https://offcampus.housing.cmu.edu/housing/property/unit-905-new-king-edward/ocpwe3wsfl)

Partys at CMU
Hey everyone, I am an entering graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University and I am curious about the party scene at CMU.

MSBA Interview Tips
Has anyone here gone through the interview process for the MSBA program (online program specifically but not sure if it’s different to the in person program)? Or just any CMU grad school interview who would be able to provide some tips/examples of questions that were asked?

This is my first grad school interview and not really sure what to expect so definitely appreciate any help at all!

21-373 study tips
Am I the only one who is kind of lost in this class? The course feels so unstructured, and the professor keeps recording these 'optional, supplementary' lectures that he references the next class and doesn't define the terms he uses but just goes on and on *explaining* if you can call it that. I'm trying to read through the book, but honestly, I don't really see the value in teaching myself the whole class with a book. There are no TAs on canvas, and the professor keeps saying that we can ask him questions over email, but I don't think having him write in text the content of the past 2 weeks will help.

Any study strategies that you found helpful would be very much appreciated!!

Does anyone know why gates has that smell?
I’ve been wondering for years, I just walked through it tonight and finally decided to see if anyone knows. Specifically the forbes side entrance to the fourth floor, I haven’t really noticed it anywhere else. The smell reminds me of going to an aquarium, but I’m reasonably sure there aren’t any tanks of jellyfish in there. Sort of chemical and sort of musty

15251 advice
I am a remote student currently working through this course and have not been doing well on the homeworks (currently getting destroyed by this one).

However, from what I've heard, retaking this course is terrible and that on average it is possible to pass, but with my grades it doesn't feel like I can do it, even though I have been putting in effort to do my proofs and enjoy the material.

I'm kinda at a crossroads for dropping the course, wherein, I have a decent group (we meet over zoom), and I have enjoyed working with them versus conserving my energy and taking the course in a different semester, maybe when I am on campus. Personally, I would rather not drop the course as taking it is inevitable as a CS Major, but I also know that it'll be very difficult to even make the threshold of a 70%... any words of advice?

Where can I go to do interviews during the day?
I have an interview this Thursday and I want to find a quiet place on campus to do it (home isn't an option unfortunately). Is there a place on campus where I can get a classroom or private room to do the interview?  I noticed a lot of classrooms in buildings say Available on the LED screens outside the doors but I can't actually get into them with my ID card.

Schedule 3 form?
A couple months back I sent all of my financial aid info through IDOC. Then I just checked today and there is a new document that is marked "Not Received".  It just says Schedule 3, unlike the other documents that specify if its from the parent or student, this one just simply says Schedule 3. Anyone know what to do with this?

Anyone want to work on my startup with me?
Here's a quick rundown. Sophomore at CMU right now. Have about 25k in grants to spend on the first prototype. I'm currently talking with the swartz center to find technical cofounders. Figured I might as well reach out here.

Looking for mechanical engineers/electrical engineers/SWE/ or anyone who wants to create a startup. If you want to burn $25,000 making something cool — and potentially making something great, message me! Undergraduates completely welcome. Worst case, you get something to put on your resume for the summer!

I'll give you the rundown on the idea, give you my qualifications and ask for yours, and see if you'd like in on the ride.

P.S. If you love boba tea, you'll be a great fit!

edit: Thanks for all the interest. However, we're looking for people preferably in Pittsburgh right now, and definitely in Pittsburgh over the summer. If aren't in Pittsburgh, I'm sorry but we can't accommodate you! Thanks for the interest anyway!

 edit2: all done thanks all, no more requests please!

How to deal with depression
I probably shouldn't be saying this just as a freshman, but how do you deal with depression, when you feel like what you have done or the way you have done things seems to be not working anymore and feel like all of your effort is doubted? I've always been like this, but recently, it has been hitting me really hard. I am considering calling caps, but I heard that it's not like they can really help people "cure" this stuff. I have friends in school to talk to, but I do not wanna make them my emotional dumping friends, and same to all my high school friends, not to mention everyone is also busy and I do not want to bother. Anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with these...
--------------------------------------------------
Does literally everyone do CS here?
Physics major here. Does everyone, and I mean everyone, go for software engineering jobs here? I swear everyone at Cmu and their moms all want to code. I'm good friends with 4 other physics majors in my class; they all want to do SWE. Everyone wants to transfer into SCS (until they see the requirements at least).  Instead they all transfer to IS/statml to do cs. They all grind leetcode, and have internships this summer.  

Obviously exaggerating, but dang does cs have such a god damn big focus around here. Bro I just want to look at stars and work at nasa.

What are 15-210 exams like?
I have the first midterm for 15-210 next week and I'm terrified. I feel like I haven't learned much in the course yet to be honest. The homeworks only have one coding question and there seems to just be a lack of practice material for the course. Any tips on how to prepare?

Virtual Interactions Research (CMU First-Year Students Only)
Hello! My team and I are conducting research on the nature of virtual interactions for one of our classes, and we are currently looking for first-year student responses. We would really appreciate any input you can provide in the form of anonymous responses on this Miro board: 

[https://miro.com/.../W7E1XoqjSzdeTZgoxVhQix4WVKWwJQ5sM9wh...](https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/W7E1XoqjSzdeTZgoxVhQix4WVKWwJQ5sM9whkLnuPaKNxADTXNe9xNJWXKPQtQAf?fbclid=IwAR1RiR_m4sKrL0yAM_bPrAenY8dIyhQUdUu-duVKa4SWXRKoFJDsApZxNiY)

Difference between HCI and IDEATE for Game Design?
Hi! I'm a freshman at Dietrich College majored in psychology. I'd love to stick to my home major but I'm also thinking about pursuing video game-related things as a career. 

The two programs that I'm currently looking at are an additional major in HCI and minor in the game design branch of IDEATE. I've finished 15-112 and am taking 15-122. Based on the experience in these two courses I feel like the pure programming is manageable but not so much fun in comparison with another mini-course on Unity I'm taking. It seems to me that IDEATE has more courses closely related to the game design. Yet since they only offer minors, I'm kinda afraid that it wouldn't be as impressive as a double-major on the resume.

So I'm wondering what it is like in these two programs. Does one of them have a lot heavier workload than the other? Are they providing necessary education for people pursuing jobs in game design? Also, is it hard to get into these two programs? Is a decent GPA enough or you'll need some other recommendation letters or internship experience?

Thanks!!!

Need some Heinz/MSISPM insight!
Hey y’all,
Recently got accepted to the MSISPM program, and I have a few questions: 
1. The course catalog shows the program takes four semesters to complete, but we’re only billed for three?
2. How are the real-world job prospects? I’ve seen a lot of mixed opinions about Heinz masters degrees (some people are calling them “cash cow” degrees)
3. Has anyone successfully negotiated their scholarship?
4. Anything else a prospective Masters student might want to know? 

I’d greatly appreciate any insight!

Phys2 for engineering
Hi, I'm a freshman in chem E taking phys2, and trying to transfer over to ECE if possible. Sooooo I just had a massive rip with my physics 2 exam, didn't know what the F was going on for half of the questions and just scribbled down bs. What's the curve for the first test on phys2? Also, if I get a B on this class, will my chances for ECE be none? I had a 4.0 last sem, and hopefully, if I get all A's and 1 B on phys2, I can have like a high 3 QPA. Anyone mind telling me what QPA people had that successfully transferred to ECE?

Views on MS Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical engineering
Hello People, I got admitted to the program MS Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Engg a couple of days back. The coursework seems amazing, but it’s a new program at CMU, the first batch is yet to graduate in 2021. 


I was unable to connect with any seniors. It would mean a lot if this community gives their valuable opinion on this new program or if you can guide me to a current student.


Thankyou

thoughts on cold-contacting alumni?
Through linkedin or email for example. I'm a senior who still doesnt have a fulltime job lined up after college. For reference, I'm applying for data science positions. I don't want to annoy anyone, but wondering if it would be acceptable to cold-contact alumni to see if they'd be willing to help my job search in some capacity. 

Also, any advice on the job grind in general? I definitely messed up by not finding an internship junior year because my response rate for new grad positions has been super bad. I'm extremely worried I won't be able to find a job by graduation. Not just financially, but I don't want to disappoint my parents by having to move back in with them.  And then I have to deal with the student debt somehow :(( In general, just super worried about my future, regretting past decisions, and trying my best to get a job.

Kiron Skinner is NO LONGER head of Institute for Politics and Strategy!

Dear Faculty, Staff, Students and Friends of IPS:
 
In order to enable her to provide increased focus on the completion of two books currently in process, her work with The Heritage Foundation on an Atlantic Strategy initiative, and her involvement with the newly formed Forum for America and the World, Professor Kiron K. Skinner has announced her decision to step down as director of Carnegie Mellon’s Institute for Politics and Strategy (IPS). 
 
IPS is a University-wide institute conducted under the supervision of the Deans of the School of Computer Science, the College of Engineering, and the Dietrich College. As its inaugural director, Dr. Skinner has been integral in building IPS which includes degree-granting programs offering Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees, the Washington Semester Program, the Center for International Relations and Politics, and the Institute for Strategic Analysis. On behalf of the University, we recognize and thank Kiron for the depth and breadth of her contributions to IPS.
 
Dr. Skinner will continue to serve as the Taube Professor for International Relations and Politics. She also holds appointments in the Heinz College of Public Policy and Information Systems, and the Institute for Software Research in the School of Computer Science. We look forward to her future contributions to CMU.
 
In addition to her CMU faculty position, Dr. Skinner is the W. Glenn Campbell Research Fellow at the Hoover Institute. From 2018 to 2019 she served as the Director for Policy Planning and Senior Advisor to the U.S. Secretary of State, and has also served on numerous policy boards, government panels and nonprofit boards. She is a lifetime director on the board of the Atlantic Council, and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Pacific Council on International Policy.
 
Carnegie Mellon and Professor Skinner remain unwavering in their commitment to the mission of IPS and to fostering an environment where all viewpoints and the free exchange of ideas are welcomed as the bedrock of our academic community. As Carnegie Mellon begins a national search for a new director, it is pleased to announce that Dr. Mark Kamlet, University Professor of Economics and Public Policy and Provost Emeritus, has agreed to assume interim leadership of the Institute.
 
Sincerely,
James H. Garrett, Jr.
Provost and Chief Academic Officer

15150 rounding fall 2020

Getting into robotics from software?
CS junior here, wondering what the best way to get into the field of robotics would be with about 1 year of courses to choose from.  Would prefer practical courses.

Preferably leading to a job in robotics OR starting ability/knowledge for a robotics startup.

Also would love advice as to how to further myself aside from classes. I tried getting an internship @ some robotics company, but no luck this year :(.

I have no experience with hardware/electrical engineering stuff/advanced physics aside from required courses, but I really think robotics/automation is going to be the next big thing and want to be a part of it. Thank you all!

Hey so like how to I actually meet people right now?

Any freshmen feeling lonely ?
I just feel like it’s been really hard to meet new people and take part in ~social activities~ this semester. I feel like I’m the only one because I see people around me socialising and having fun all the time but maybe that’s just a social media thing.

Vector Analysis (21-269) and ODE (21-261)
Hi I’ve been reading enough CMU posts recently to know I’m not the only one struggling with the course load they are dealing with this semester. Right now I too am more or less drowning in my courses. Can anyone give me any helpful advice for doing well in these classes. I should mention I am overloading this semester and taking 15-112 and other classes. Should I just drop 21-261 before it’s too late?

Concentration in Security & Privacy
Hi I was interested if anyone's done or is doing a concentration in security and privacy in either the CS or ECE departments. I was just curious on how that is and if it coincides well with both majors. 

I've taken a recent interest in cyber/network security, (last semester started playing around w some ctf problems and just reading ab it) and I was wondering if the PPP are still hosting meetings/presentations?  Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------
Internship + 15-213 over the summer?
How plausible is doing a 40 hours/week remote internship with 15-213 over the summer? Summer schedule of classes hasn't come out but I doubt it can mandate being in person, which will make it a lot easier for me to accommodate. I started out taking 15-112 last semester, so I feel like knocking out 213 in the summer would catch me up to people who started with 15-122.
--------------------------------------------------
What's some interesting research happening at CMU this year? Who's doing it?

worth transferring into SCS if requirements met
Just curious, math major soph spring sem. Met the gpa requirements for the required classes. 

Will be going into swe as a career. Had an internship freshman year and have one this summer. Any reason to transfer into CS rather than just cruising through the rest of my math degree. For example, would it drastically help getting more FAANG/quant internships/jobs or nah?

Dropping 122
Hello,

I am seriously considering dropping 122 and adding 18-202 to my schedule. I have found that 122 is much harder than I expected, and I want to push it off to a later semester. Would this be a bad idea for my later semesters? And how much would this change lower my workload?

For context, I am a freshman majoring ECE and I am currently also taking concepts.

Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------
Time commitment for 15122?
Trying to see if I can fit 122 into my schedule next fall.

The course itself is 12 units, but curious as to how long you actually spent for the class a week? For example, one of the biggest things is the labs, how long do the labs take you to do every week?

Thanks

CPDC First Destination Suhvey
Recently, there was a reddit thread [0] that had misgivings about the accuracy of CPDC's [first destination suhvey](https://www.cmu.edu/career/about-us/salaries-and-destinations/) as OP's data was pulled from LinkedIn.

I reached out to CPDC (and they're very open to anyone else reaching out), who clarified that:

- CPDC generally follows [NACE](https://www.naceweb.org/) guidelines,
- During President Obama's term, approximately six years ago, a college scorecard requirement was introduced which required career services to have a response rate of at least 65% for first destination data,
- Due to low response rates, NACE approved the sourcing of first destination data from various sources including LinkedIn, the student's parents, etc.
- The scorecard has since disappeared but the modified NACE guidelines remain,
- CPDC treats first destination suhvey data (via Handshake/advisor) as authoritative,
- CPDC only looks at LinkedIn (job title and employer and possibly location), and this is only if you do not respond to the suhvey,
- In the event that CPDC looks at LinkedIn, they try to make a good faith effort to confirm the data, e.g., if it looks like you haven't updated your profile at all since senior year and it still says you're a research assistant at CMU they won't take that at face value and won't include it.

More factoids:

- The summer internship suhveys are generally not as aggressive about collecting data (except for business where internship stats is tied to a requirement somewhere), response rate is around 35%, they just report what they get,
- CPDC deviates slightly from guidelines in making pretty public-facing figures when there isn't enough data, e.g., combining Military + Volunteer into Others since very few CMU people go on to those, the full breakdown is still reported elsewhere,
- If you want CPDC to update your data for accuracy, reach out to them and it'll usually be reflected in a day or so,
- If you respond to the first destination suhvey data as Employed but don't want to provide your employer they will just leave it as Unknown,
- If you aren't employed you should respond to the first destination suhvey as Seeking so that they can continue sending followup emails for job/networking opportunities,
- The TL;DR is that handshake/advisor suhveys are authoritative if you do them, otherwise they'll try LinkedIn.

I was surprised by the LinkedIn at first, but overall this seems fairly reasonable to me. They also mentioned that they'd try to clarify the data collection process better when they did their summer website refresh.

Learned something, so thanks to OP of the other thread. This is my recollection of the chat, hopefully didn't garble anything.

Spelling changed to avoid automod. Stupid robots.

Junior in college tour
I’m sitting in a college tour rn and I can’t help but think that getting into CS in CMU is absolutely ridiculous. With an average perfect score on the SAT and a 7% acceptance rate, it feels like I’m gonna pass out. Does anyone that is currently or graduated from CS at CMU have any tips that would calm me down or help me. Thank you

Edit: wanted to say thank you to everyone in the comments, you guys not only relived some stress but also motivated me to try my absolute best.

Apartments and Parking
Hi everyone! 

I’m an incoming graduate student this fall, and I was wondering if you would all be able to point me to some apartment buildings that are nice and trustworthy around the area? 

Also, I saw on here that parking passes on CMU’s campus are almost $200 a month? Is that actually true? I couldn’t find any thing on the website about this. 

Thanks everyone!

Choosing between MSCS and MSR
I had acceptance from both MSCS and MSR last cycle but I defer them due to the pandemic. As the title, I don't know what to choose between MSCS and MSR. I have research experiences (and publications) during my undergrad in Computer Vision and Deep Learning. At the same time, I'm 100% sure that I don't want to pursue a PhD, so I just want to become an industry researcher such as Research Engineer in some companies doing CV. My questions are:

1. MSR have some requirements like state estimation and/or dynamics/control that kind of things (MechE/EE-related topics), which I'm not interested in. Meanwhile for MSCS, you have a lot of freedom to decide your program (to some extent). As an MSR student, do you have trouble organizing your schedule to fit in some classes in areas you are interested in (e.g., ML department or CV, optimization classes?)
2. MSR is a research-based program while MSCS is coursework-based. Is it possible to pursue MSCS while heavily participating in research (thesis)? Additionally, MSR students are assigned advisors which, in many cases, will help fund their studies (a lot of students on some advisors' homepages are MSR, not MSCS). If I choose to go with MSCS due to their flexible requirements, is it harder for me to find advisors compared with MSR (given that all of my POIs are in the Robotics Institute)? (funding is important, but most importantly I want to do research during my time at CMU).

&#x200B;

Thanks a lot!

11-601 Coding Bootcamp
Did anyone take 11-601 Coding Bootcamp this fall? I am a prospective MSAII student for the upcoming fall and want to make sure I’m adequately preparing for the coursework. The preliminary syllabus for 11-601 that’s posted online says the expectation is that students will have intermediate proficiency in Java. Is that the final syllabus? For some reason, I distinctly remember reading somewhere that the problems could be done in C, Java, or Python but now I can’t find where I read that. Thanks in advance!
--------------------------------------------------
MRSD - SMART Scholarship
Hello. I am looking into MRSD financial aid, and it mentions the SMART Scholarship with the DoD. I looked into it, and had some concerns, so I was wondering if anyone else had the same concerns, or went through the program and could comment. According to the DoD SMART website:

\- You must be a "citizen of the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, or United Kingdom at time of application" (to the scholarship)

\- "If you are currently a dual citizen and/or possess a passport for a non-United States country you may be asked to renounce your foreign citizenship and relinquish possession of your foreign passport to your security office."

I am a dual citizen (Canada, then got my US citizenship). Will I have to renounce my Canadian citizenship? I find it odd since Canadian citizens are allowed, so maybe dual citizenship with Canada is okay, but maybe they have a policy against dual citizenship in general. 

I also suspect it's job/site dependent; maybe on some sites, dual citizenship is okay, on others, it's not. If that's the case, then can I choose/request what site I go to? If not, will they force me into a position of giving up my Canadian citizenship, or pay back the scholarship money?

Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------
Reneging Internship Consequences
I am in a position where I have to decide if it is worth reneging my original internship for one that I think might be better for my career long term. The consequences for this would be having my Handshake account suspended and being banned from using Career Services for 2 semesters. As a junior who will be looking for full time jobs next year, is it worth it to lose access to CMU Career Services for a better offer? Has CMU Career Services or the career fair been particularly helpful for you to find a job? From my experience, I got most of my internships this year through Grace Hopper, and I felt like with the virtual career fairs this year, not a lot of the big and fancy companies were recruiting at CMU.

Advices for applying to MS in HCI program
Hi, I’m a senior in college graduating in May and I’m thinking of applying to HCI program here. My BS are double major in Business Admin and Graphic Communication, GPA 3.87 (trying to get to 3.9 by the end of this semester). I working as a graphic design intern at a small local company and also an UX Designer at a start up in my home country (I’m an international student). The college I went to is a lesser name college in Wisconsin. I’m also planning to start on GRE once I graduate

Thing that I’m mainly concern about is the financial aid (of any kind) available for this program? Is there a big grant/scholarship would be available? And what would be the benchmark for GRE for me to achieve such thing?

Please help me >< All your inputs would be really helpful.

Is retaking courses okay?
I’m definitely fishing for reassurement here. I have to retake three courses if I recall correctly. I feel like a piece of shit because of it and am wondering if anyone else has had to retake multiple courses and if they’re okay now. Thanks.

CMU cut my finaid for the year because I chose to live at home and I have to pay back the finaid I got for fall semester too now :(
More of a vent post but man that's kinda cruel imo. Didn't see it coming either, I've been living remote since covid hit last spring. The reason is because I lived remote this year. I chose to live at home to save money (the irony huh).

Sometimes I think I should have gone to my state school but it's too late for that or transferring lol.  I was 18 and I worked really hard in high school and I wanted to go to the "one of the best cs schools in the country".  I got lost in the prestige.

I feel like it's only worth it if you're someone exceptional, because then you can do research with world class professors and take really hard classes and realize your potential. But I'm an average dude.

Sorry to complain. I know I'm really lucky that I got to go to CMU and get a great education and have a lot of opportunities other people don't get. My mom's such an angel, totally supported me coming to cmu, and always says that investing in my education will always be worth it to her. I just wish she could retire.

Anybody help me about TOPIC MODELS quiz coursera (stuck for 1 month) HELP!!

Just got into the Masters of Literary & Cultural Studies Program! How do you pay for it?
The title is self explanatory lol but basically my program only covers 45% of tuition cost and I’m left on the hook for everything else. 

That’s $26,000 for tuition and probably $20,000 in living expenses roughly I’ll have to take out a loan for. 

Has anyone done this successfully through government loans? I’ll be considered an independent once I move out, and I really don’t want to have to ask my parents to co-sign for much considering my younger sister is just starting her undergrad as well. 

Tips, tricks, suggestions? Thanks!

Review on Software development studio in Master of software engineer ( MSE ) course
I see that studio occupies 2 full semesters + 1half semester, there is very little information on the website regarding studio. I have few questions,

1) Are the students paid for work in studio project. Pay        range?
2) Is it similar to internship. Are students allowed to intern covering studio credits.
3) What kind of work is done in studio projects. I have seen few projects on website which are quite cool, but in general is it going to be software development or can be research in any labs in CS department? Does college help for finding a suitable studio project?
4) Do students spend summer doing studio project or find internships?

Trouble finding internship
Hey everyone,
I don’t want to sugar coat it in any way so I will try to keep it as simple and straightforward as possible.
I am a graduate international student pursuing masters here. I am currently looking for summer internship and It’s disheartening to see that everyday I am getting only rejections. I had the opportunity to appear for few online assessments as well and I have solved all the challenges I faced but still never heard back from them.
I changed my resume several times and I followed all the cmu guidelines but still my resume is not being selected. “The only lacking thing which i see in my resume is the relevant experience”. I am applying for machine learning and swe roles and I started working on it when i came to cmu. So i don’t have industrial experience in the same but aren’t internships supposed to give you the experience?I am totally befuddled that what changes needs to be done. I don’t want to lie in my resume and I asked few seniors to have a look and they all said it looks fine. 

I might sound depressing but I will gather courage to back myself again but I just want your suggestions if I am doing something wrong here? What can be corrected?
--------------------------------------------------
Any recommendations for (affordable) summer college courses?
Wondering because I don't have anything lined up for this summer I feel like I should take a course or two in the meantime. Unfortunately, local community colleges / public universities aren't an option for me, and if I have to do it remotely I might as well save money, right? 

Would appreciate any recommendations/experiences!

Questions about MS in Robotics program
So I just got accepted for the MS in Robotics program at CMU. I’m interested in AI robotics, and hoping that the program helps springboard me into a good PhD program(maybe even at CMU).

Anyone who has done this program(or knows someone who has), what did you do after getting the Masters? Did it help you get into a good PhD program? How was research during the program itself, and were the courses useful? How was the workload?

Pittsburgh Freeze
I'm a possible incoming student this Fall. I got to visit pgh once, but it was a sunny day. Apparently, sun is a rarity. Does pgh suck, and are you all planning to move to Cali when you graduate or is it really not that bad?

Is taking Mathematical Foundations of ECE(18-202) instead of Matrices & Calc 3d viable?
I was looking at the pre-requisites for a CS class and I saw that Mathematical Foundations of Electrical Engineering (18-202) is *supposedly* equivalent to both Matrices (21-249) & Calc 3d (21-259).

Example: Prerequisites for Computer Vision:

**(**  18-202 **and**  15-122  **)** **or** **(**   21-241 **and**  21-259 **and**  15-122  **)**

So is it reasonable for a non-Engineer to take this class over those other classes?

how is student life for a grad/ MSP student?
I was admitted to the masters of statistical practice program and am wondering how grad student life is at cmu (rigor of the msp program, social life for masters students, etc) any input on the program or general grad student life is appreciated!

Econ + Math Major has a 3.5+ QPA req???
Since when??? I thought CS was the only major with that high of a GPA hurdle? I guess I'll be sticking to engineering for now then...

CMU Comp Bio Masters Fall 2021, New to CMU
Just got a letter of acceptance for CMU, this was my top choice for computational biology. 

Do master's students get financial aid at all? For the first semester, looking to save money of housing and transportation, any courses to take that are online? Are there any labs or something in which I would have to physically be at CMU? 

&#x200B;

Recommendation for first semester classes?

Looking for advice from MAPW or English MA students!
I really really did not think I was going to get in but I did! With scholarship! I also got into a different, less expensive program so I'm currently weighing my options. Not only am I worried about financing this degree, but I am really worried about handling the course load. How can I know if I can actually pass these classes? I'm worried CMU is way above my skill level and capacities.

Do CMU IDs work on buses if you've told the University you're remote?
Hi,

Sorry for the dumb question. I marked myself in the CMU survey as someone not returning to campus but I may need to take a trip to the city to get some things. Will my CMU ID work on the buses or should I bring a bunch of change with me?

ML/DL internship advice for grad students
I'm a grad student in the ECE department and have been preparing and applying for Summer 21 internships. 

Do the courses taken, RA and projects matter or is Leetcode the only thing I should be caring about?
