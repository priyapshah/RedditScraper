Sorry I picked this place
This school has ruined my life. It is a soulless bureaucracy. I am dropping out next fall. I have nowhere to go. The faculty constantly roam around the campus and you constantly feel like you‚Äôre being watched. The environment is toxic and hostile and on fire (literally, the school was closed one day because of a fire on the freeway). The people are cold and heartless and competitive. The school has NO, and I mean NO character. The school took me from being a straight-A student to bring not able to get out of bed in the morning and failing all my classes? I have not made ONE friend here. If you‚Äôre wealthy, you should have no problem, and will speak to you in a condescending voice and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you feel that way‚Äù or ‚Äúdo you want help?‚Äù You can just tell they‚Äôre wealthy. Give me 100 dollars then I reply. That would help me. And then they just walk off. Sorry that not all of us are wealthy. This school caters to the wealthy and the well-groomed. It is a disgusting rigid place and I cannot wait to get far far away from it.

More USAC Recommendations
I saw someone else do this and wanted to do my own recommendations. I‚Äôve worked in over 4 different USAC offices and helped on a gen rep campaign last year. This year I‚Äôve been a casual observer.

FTP vs Bruin Solutions
Both slates are good. They want to help the campus. Each in their own ways. Both have some excellent candidates and then some meh candidates. Let‚Äôs look at each race. I gave president some extra attention.

President: Armaan or Breeze
I know people might not like my choice here but hear me out. This is a two way race for President. On one hand, Breeze will be fierce leader with tons of USAC experience and a great record to run on. The creation of a Student Advocate Board helped a significant number of students who were battling academic dishonesty cases. The books for Bruins scholarship, despite some questionable allocation processes, does help students every quarter. She has experience in Academic Senate and successfully kickstarted a potential new minor. I think she will make great strides as president. Whether it‚Äôs pushes for defunding the police on campus, helping students that started small businesses, or thinking ahead to the 2028 Olympics, Breeze has a good record and a forward thinking vision that will help students. On the other hand, Armaan is a rare USAC outsider. He seems to have a great grasp of how USAC works that even the two other candidates running for USAC President lack. He has arguably the best platform that does connect with a lot of students and in my opinion if accomplished will help marginalized students the most. I liked his guides, in-depth explanations of his platforms, and how he‚Äôs talked about things like ASUCLA and the appointment process. A lot of criticism, about not having experience or reaching out to communities already doing the work, he‚Äôs goten is unfair in my opinion. Ultimately I think either Breeze or Armaan will make good presidents. They each bring different assets to the table. Breeze has been a powerhouse AAC and Armaan has a dynamic vision for the Office of the President. 

IVP: Bakur 
The senate system is long overdue at UCLA. I trust Bakur to get it done. Period, vote for Bakur.

EVP: Sarah
The current EVP office has been a powerhouse. Aidan is a goat and once in a lifetime type student leader. I trust anyone from his office to continue the work; and Sarah is that person. She‚Äôll be great. 

AAC: Atharva 
One of the best candidates running in my opinion. He has solid USAC experience being a chief of staff and he also ran last year in the gen rep race. I think he will make a great AAC and will deliever results to students. I‚Äôve also been a big fan of Lizbeth‚Äôs campaign, check her out as well. I‚Äôll vote Atharva because I think he wins on experience and platforms. 

FSC: Emily
FSC might be one of the hardest offices to run rn considering the massive number of Covid relief grants they are allocating. Emily has worked on this and I think that even more important now. This is a no brainer. Vote Emily. 

FAC: Jane or Elijah
This race has gotten intense. I think there‚Äôs unnecessary hate on both sides. Like Armaan, Elijah is a rare outsider candidate that has a great understanding of the role. Jane has also done the work and her platforms range from small scale to ambitious goals like a UCLA Green New Deal. Will she get it done? Probably not, but if you shoot for Mars maybe you‚Äôll hit the moon. Elijah‚Äôs bathroom platform is alone good reason to vote for him. This race has gotten tons of coverage so I‚Äôll leave it at that. Both will be good FACs, let‚Äôs not break each other down over it. 

Gen Rep 1: Hailey
Great experience great platforms. She‚Äôs running with FTP but brings a unique stem background to the mix. She‚Äôs an all star, give her a chance and vote for her. 

Gen Rep 2: Passa 
Another candidate like Armaan and Elijah, she is a legit outsider. She has a great grasp of the issues and the gen rep office is a great office for a first timer new to USAC. 

Gen Rep 3: Asante
Cool to see a freshman have such a well put together campaign. Asante has great organizations supporting her and she will be great at advocating for marginalized communities. 

SWC: Tayloneei
Running as an independent and not from the office, she‚Äôs the real deal. One of the best platforms this office has ever seen, she has a great reputation and even though she isn‚Äôt from the office, I‚Äôm confident she will work well with current SWC leaders. SWC has been run by internal picks for as long as I can remember, Tayoneei will be a bit of fresh air. Give her a shot. 

CEC: Maya
A lot of big events are put on by the CEC. It‚Äôs important that someone with experience run the show. Maya is the person. 

CSC: Mominah
Same as CEC, there‚Äôs big projects already happening. I don‚Äôt think a freshman is ready to take over all of a sudden. I trust Mominah for the job.

CAC: Promise
She was great this year, will continue to be great. Also always good to have at least one returner on council. 

ISR: Natalia 
Another fresh face. Looks like she will serve the community well. 

Disclaimer: Including this because everyone should go check out the election board website. Lots of helpful information to go make your decisions. Also I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt agree with all my picks, that‚Äôs okay. That‚Äôs why we have a vote. Let‚Äôs stop tearing down candidates and making it bigger than this needs to be. Please respect them everyone that stepped up to do some good for the student body. If they make mistakes remember: everyone is human. www.uclaelectionsboard.org

Quick appreciation post
Hey y‚Äôall! 

I just wanted to give a quick appreciation post to y‚Äôall on this subreddit. When I started my campaign, I honestly thought it would be pointless and that I would probably have to drop out during the first week of campaigning. I didn‚Äôt know where to start, and my campaign Instagram had 10 followers (lol). I even missed an endorsement hearing on accident.

But on the contrary, this subreddit been very receptive to my platforms, and even my personality (which I deeply appreciate)! I have received nothing but support (besides my two sanctions haha), and have had a really fun time running my campaign, getting to comment all over the place and making myself look goofy. 

So, regardless of if I get one of the Gen Rep spots, I just wanted to thank you all! The foster youth community, homeless students, students with dependents, formerly incarcerated students, BIPOC & LGBTQ+ students, and those struggling with mental health thank you for uplifting me and my ideas! And I hope that even when my campaign is over, you will continue to remember these different communities :)

With love,
me

Can we make just ONE mega thread for all the USAC Shit
I‚Äôm tired of seeing every other post about USAC. All of the candidates suck.

If anything, I‚Äôll probably be more likely to vote for the slate who I didn‚Äôt see any posts from.

Thoughts on Westwood?
Is it just me or is Westwood a rather dystopian place to be? First there‚Äôs the trash on the streets and the faint smell of sewage. Then there is the constant odor of hookah smoke emanating from the three hookah lounges that envelopes your lungs with an unmistakable gritty feeling. The endless traffic and constant construction make it a nightmare for those who enjoy common forms of outdoor recreation. The people are far from friendly. This is understandable, as Westwood is a clash of equally problematic cultures: the struggling homeless and the mega-wealthy who sit insulated in their cozy houses, unwilling to help those around them. I wish I had seen this place. I never would have picked this school.

Good evening my lovely bruins, so this year has so far been shit and im barely keeping up this quarter. I completely forgot about the sexual assault online course we all have to take, that was due yesterday. Can't remember my password for the site, so I  tried resetting it. I didn't get a link in all my inboxes. Does anyone know a support email I can reach out to? Cause on Everfi it says I'm supposed to contact the school itself.

Thank you all in advance, hope y'all have a great evening <3

Uplifting Transfer Bruins
Today I wanted to share a platform that I've discussed at many endorsement hearings and in conversations with transfer students. Before deciding to run I asked a range of students what issues they felt were important for a presidential candidate to run with. In addition, shortly after deciding to run I attended one of the amazing UCLA Community Transfer Awareness Trainings put on by the TSR Office. Among the transfer students I polled a large percentage of them addressed a common issue with especially career-oriented professional clubs that are considered very competitive due to their low acceptance rates. These clubs are vital for building professional networks and thus limiting transfers to them can seriously limit their career prospects. 

While these clubs don't have a no-transfer policy they use *other tactics* to ensure transfers cannot have a significant voice in their clubs. Some common tactics I found from students or via my own research include:

* Established UCLA GPAs: excluding nearly half of the transfer community
* Required classes: These classes can be taken in years 1 and 2 for students planning to stay 4-years if they are aware of the clubs they need to join to better their career in the future. However, transfers must wait until they take said classes at UCLA. 

Both of these policies seek to exclude first-year transfer students and then the final policy removes any remaining transfers

* Minimum 2-year commitments: Thus effectively eliminating all transfer students if any of the 2 policies above are implemented. 
* This problem is further compounded by the fact that leadership positions in said clubs require a one-year minimum before application. To be president of the club students are often asked to serve one year in leadership, thus denying any transfer student from being able to serve as president of many professional-oriented clubs. This same issue is also seen in USAC where transfers can only run for office the first year they enter UCLA which de facto limits the positions transfers can serve within USAC. 

**So the question is what can USAC do?**

First off we have to bring light to these issues. Additionally, we have to take actionable steps that USAC can do. One thing we can do is changing club funding guidelines for student organizations that discriminate against transfers forcing them to promote equal accessibility. USAC sets the guidelines for Contiengncy funding that many student organizations apply to and I will work with the USAC Finance Committee to seek to find ways we can limit funding clubs to clubs that are discriminating against transfer students. Amongst organizations outside of SOLE, our reach is limited but the Office of the President still has the unique advantages of the bully pulpit and quarterly meetings with administration to change administrative policies.

Don‚Äôt vote any USAC slate straight down the ballot
I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of posts that are either very strongly pro/anti Bruin Solutions or For the People, so I‚Äôll just say this - if you blindly vote for ANY one slate over another and encourage people to do the same, you‚Äôre just turning the UCLA subreddit into another circle jerk. 

You can‚Äôt criticize ALL of one slate in the one breath and blindly support ALL of another slate in the next. 

A lot of the commissions have Bruin Solutions opponents running against the experienced candidates (not all of whom are For the People by the way!) - AAC, SWC, FSC, FAC. CSC and CEC also have people with virtually no relevant experience/actionable platforms running against experienced candidates. 

*please* look into every candidate before voting solely based on what you‚Äôve seen here. This subreddit is as much of an echo-chamber as any other social media platform, so do your due diligence researching before voting!
--------------------------------------------------
Does r/UCLA harbor racist views?
I think it does. It has done so for a long time. If you don't like being called racists by FTP supporters, then don't be racist. It's that simple. 

Let's not pretend that this subreddit isn't mostly priveledged white and Asian stem students who have no clue what it's like to be black or latinx at UCLA.

USAC Politics
I‚Äôm a first year and I just discovered this subreddit about a month ago. Lately, I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of talk about the USAC election and I‚Äôve seen a lot of jargon like ‚ÄúFTP‚Äù and something about the users of this subreddit being racist?? Being a first year, I still live at home with my parents and have very few friends at UCLA who are also first years and don‚Äôt know wtf is going on with this election. Can somebody please explain the political structure within USAC and what exactly is going on with this referendum?
--------------------------------------------------
A vote for FTP is a vote for the people who said this sub was nothing but a bunch of stemlord racists
Don't give them your vote.

Just want to say that FTP is a joke
They've done nothing to improve relations with this community over the past year. And their policies don't reflect anything we've stated. So they don't get my vote.

Random dm from someone in GroupMe offering to help me with classes???
So I am a freshman and am fairly new to GroupMe. I mean I know how it works and how to use it but recently a random person from one of my classes dm‚Äôed me asking if I needed help in any of my classes. I thought it was weird because I had never talked to this person before. They said they had already graduated, so I checked my class‚Äôs TA site but their name wasn‚Äôt there. I asked them a few questions and they said they enjoyed helping out college students. Then they sent a screenshot of their dm with a student they had helped before and the student was thanking them. Anyway, this person sent their email as well and I just said thanks but I didn‚Äôt need any help at the moment. This all seems very sus to me. Does this happen often? Are these people out to hack or anything?

Fun Club Recs
Hi! So this online year has made me feel pretty disconnected and lonely. To try and combat this, I joined and/or applied to (rejected rip) to a few clubs that I felt would help... but they really didn't. The ones I am apart of are not very social or close-knit. I have browsed the UCLA club list, but honestly I got a little lost on it. 
I'm open to look into literally anything fun/interesting/new if the club has a great dynamic. I really just want recommendations for warm/sociable clubs. If anyone is apart of one right now, I'd be so down to hearing about it!

USAC candidate Jacob Keer shows a lack of maturity
Don't believe me? Check out the Eboard's Notice of Finding #C21-49. [Click here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a_7kBllWccpcDjvbTd3nakxcsL6Ps2f7) to read more about Keer's immature behavior. It's the fifth PDF from the top. 

Essentially, Jacob held up an entire debate by being the *only* candidate to not show up when he was supposed to. Mind you, he literally signed a waiver beforehand where he acknowledged the importance of showing up and the potential consequences for not following through. So what did he do, did he show up early like any responsible person would or was he late? You guessed it. He was no where to be found when it was his turn in the debate. The guy totally threw the entire event off kilter with his actions. He show up very late and basically killed the flow.

The Eboard found that:

> Keer failed to be present at their respective scheduled time slot at the Candidate Debates. As a result of Keer‚Äôs actions, moderators were forced to accommodate Keer‚Äôs tardiness by delaying the debates for the External Vice Presidential Candidate and moving on to the debates Internal Vice Presidential Candidate. Such actions disrupted the flow of the debates; it forced the moderators to ask the candidates for IVP to go before their scheduled time slot and potentially disrupted their preparedness, took more time of EVP candidates, and complicated the ability of moderators to control the flow of the debates.

The guy disrespected fellow candidates, he disrespected the moderators who took time out of their day to facilitate the event. And he disrespected the Eboard by not following up to emails that sought an explanation for his actions. He basically ghosted them. 

So, I ask everyone on here. Is this really the kind of person you want running student government? Someone who can't even bother to show up?

I just feel really alone.
I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd end freshman years with zero friends, but here I am. I‚Äôm 17 so it‚Äôs not like I can join apps or anything. In fact, I was surprised just how much being underage would end up making me feel excluded, though maybe I‚Äôm using it as a scapegoat for some social problems. Seeing people on Instagram with actual friends makes me feel like a failure. All the failed connections of the past year make me feel worthless. My 18th birthday is going to come and go this summer with no one other than my family to celebrate with. I know that doesn‚Äôt need to be a bad thing but... I‚Äôm sure you understand. I know there isn‚Äôt much point putting but I just wanted to vent. Anyone who‚Äôve ever feel similarly want to tell me about it, for better or worse?

Thoughts about Daily Bruin endorsements + USAC candidates?
Hey y'all! So Daily Bruin endorsements just came out and I wanted to know what people were thinking about the endorsements. Personally, I think they're so whack. I'm personally on the fence about both FTP and Bruin Solutions, so I won't make a comment on slates, but I guess I was really expecting the FTP candidates to get all the endorsements. Also for someone with experience with elections, how much do yall vote based on Daily Bruin endorsements?

**Also, I haven't voted yet and have been seeing a lot of mixed reviews on candidates so feel free to drop some recommendations down here! I encourage candidates to also participate! I just want to make an informed decision lolz**

--------------------------------------------------
Just want to say I'm sorry
I apologize to Jane. I apologize to Elijah. I apologize to u/LaserPigeons. I apologize to all of FTP and Bruin Solutions for the trouble I may have caused. I said some nasty things while I was upset, and frankly, kind of hangry. I am by no means a perfect person. I let my emotions get the best of me, and I did the wrong thing. I made a bad choice and let this community down. I did and said things I shouldn't have. We've all been there, right? It happens. I sincerely apologize and hope that we can put this all to rest right now. Let bygones by bygones. No ill-will. No bad blood. And no grudges of any kind. 

It's an emotional time for all of us. Sometimes we lose control. And we have to own up to it, acknowledge it, and promise to do better going forward. And well, I am here to do just that. I hope you all can forgive me for I've done. But I understand if you don't want to forgive so easily. But please, in either case, just know that I am genuinely sorry.

Sincerely,

Marcos

It‚Äôs called r/ucburnout if you want to vent about anything with other uc students you can do so here

Day 2: Why they say "if i ever run for any usac position my platform will explicitly include banning south campus majors from running for office or voting" and why you need to prove them wrong
&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v84kbms9rew61.png?width=1270&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac12df06bdadf1a2b56f36edfb5c16602d55a5fe

To avoid being repetitive and just spamming the sub with the same picture, I thought today I would add a reminder about why the current form of USAC and FTP has failed many of the students on this sub. If you weren't around for last year's USAC debacle, read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/duplicates/gd6jon/north_campus_dominates_ucla_politics_and_that/) to get an idea of why the North vs South campus thing is getting dragged into the election. 

Whether you vote or not, you still pay [$270](https://sa.ucla.edu/RO/Fees/Public/public-fees) in student fees to USAC. Aside from a couple instances of people running on a disband USAC platform, the average student has largely been unaware of that. This has led to cases where USAC has put forward pointless or vaguely worded fee increases. [Student fees at UCB are $33 compared to our $270](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/n1z9or/did_you_know_usac_has_a_higher_revenue_than_about/). Do we get 9 times the services that UCB students do? 

How do they keep getting away with it? Because we don't vote. I know I'm overgeneralizing here but the same North Campus/FTP crowd that made those tweets are the ones that keep voting in USAC members who keep raising our fees to fund pointless resume padding projects without giving thought to what happens next. They brag about having "spearheaded an initiative" or "founded a coalition" and the incoming class is saddled with those fees long after they graduate. 

[Last year had the highest voter turnout since 2016](https://dailybruin.com/2020/05/08/naomi-riley-elected-usac-president-with-highest-voter-turnout-since-2016) as a result of so much drama over trying to raise fees during the height of the pandemic. And even with such a contentious election, there was only 30% turnout. That's 9000 votes out of 30,000 eligible students. They need a simple majority for a fee increase to pass. If 9000 is considered a big turnout, that means USAC has been passing fee increases with less than 4500 votes for years. That's why they want South Campus to shut up and stay out of elections. Because if we start voting, they lose access to their easy fee increases.

Go vote. For every office, rank every candidate except For the People.

When should I secure a lease for off-campus apartments?
Nearly all of the apartments I've contacted are unable to lease for the next school year this far in advance (September / Late August move-in).


However, I heard that many people should find a place by Spring. The apartments told me to contact them again in July or 30 days before the move-in date so will I be okay securing a lease during the summer?

USAC Needs a Financial Audit
&#x200B;

[Text on top reads: USAC has never done a financial Audit. Blue graphic shows Armaan shooting money from potato cannon and a second Armaan saying \\"Let's Change That.\\"](https://preview.redd.it/wjk002eadew61.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8305544c2b6a98cb2d22b1d72c7a7b132141c6a)

Over the years, various student needs have led to the passage of a variety of referendum. Ranging anywhere from a couple cents each quarter to a $100 a year, these referendum were all passed by past UCLA student bodies. In total, 19 different student referendum have passed to make up the current **$10 million USAC Budget**.

Many of these student fees are actually restricted, meaning USAC doesn‚Äôt actually allocated the money. But once a fee is passed, it‚Äôs there forever.

**It‚Äôs time for a full audit of all USAC and Student fees.** Can some student fees be eliminated? Can student organization funding bodies be combined to make it easier and more accessible? Is money being spent efficiently? Are there proper oversights in place to prevent abuse? Should certain restricted funds become unrestricted to allow more flexibility in emergencies like COVID? I want to get to the bottom of this and more.

Understanding the current structure of USAC‚Äôs budget is complex. Some fees are administrated by USAC offices, some by ASUCLA, some have oversight by administration. The USAC budget is complicated too. Many of the line items don‚Äôt get properly marked so an ordinary Bruin is sure to get confused viewing the 200+ page document.

If elected, I will work with a professional team of auditors and consultants to reevaluate all current student fees. **Vote now at** [**be.my.ucla.edu/elections/election/vote**](http://be.my.ucla.edu/elections/election/vote?fbclid=IwAR0L0UsDlJH6UUpQKS8vzyld4hI91YAyTNXXVAisVZBGlBCToXLE4Hll_pw)**.** Vote for Solutions, Bruin Solutions.

snap out of the USAC aggression, fighting the wrong battle
First---

I am not associated with any USAC person or team or whatever it is called. These views are from a neutral STEM student. Both sides are taking out their aggressions on the wrong people. We are all students, and honestly, all the candidates seem super passionate and hardworking. Fight against the institution, not your peers. 

Thoughts---

Take your aggressions of budget on UCLA and UC reagents (the people actually getting paid the big bucks), not USAC students getting paid minimum wage. 

A lot of people on this sub have some note-worthy ideas (ex: the use of funding). Start a kind dialogue with those in USAC/ UCLA officials if you really care. Spouting things anonymously from a screen is not helping (can come off as hostile). 

The current USAC people seem to be really be holding the UCLA officials accountable, and that is what I am hoping for from our next board. I'm honestly super confused by this subs take on USAC because I had always thought this sub was pretty liberal and cared about social issues. 

There are a lot of south campus candidates, so I have no idea where the narrative that USAC hates STEM people is from. 

I seriously think if everyone from both sides had a conversation, you would all agree lol. Look at what issues you care about and then vote.

Thoughts on the Bruins Emergency Relief Fund?
It seems like a good idea after reading it, but I‚Äôve seen a lot about how USAC mismanages about a third of its budget every year. Is there any guarantee that the tuition increase will go to the people who need it the most? How do they decide which student in need receives the money? If you wrote this proposal or if you‚Äôre on USAC please explain how this works. I‚Äôd also like to hear everyone else‚Äôs opinion on this. Imo it‚Äôs only $2 and I feel like it could go a long way so I lean towards yes, but I can be swung either way.

Should I Apply for Summer Financial Aid
I‚Äôm worried about applying for summer financial aid because I‚Äôm not 100% sure if I‚Äôm taking classes over summer right now. 

I already know the $150 drop free if you drop all your units. But if I apply for summer financial aid and then drop all units before instruction starts, is there any additional fee at all? Also is the deadline to apply to aid at 11:59 pm PST today or earlier? Thank you!

I would love to hear student opinions of the USAC candidates!!
If you're relatively educated on what's happening right now, I would love your opinion on any/all of the candidates. I did not attend the debates, only read the website, and most of the posts I see on this subreddit are from folks campaigning themselves. 

That's fine, I'd just like to hear from my fellow Bruins not campaigning, just voting. Who are you leaning to and why?

Feel free to be biased, just please disclose if you're associated to someone or some slate. I can disclose that my partner is running for a Gen Rep position and does not have a slate. I'll leave him to do his own campaigning more than that :)

USAC FAC Election Explained: Elijah Simas vs. Jane Ni
One of the most interesting USAC races this year has shaped out to be the Facilities Commissioner race. While this may not seem like an exciting race like President or Vice President, a lot is on the line. FAC is in charge of several key appointment like OSAC (allocates office space to student organizations) and the student appointments to the John Wooden Center Board of Directors. FAC also is the chair of The Green Fund Initiative (TGIF), a referendum passed in 2016. TGIF is a $4.80 quarterly student fee that comes out to over **$500,000** a year. This money is then allocated by FAC to student organizations for various initiatives. 

This year there are two candidates running for FAC: Elijah Simas (Bruin Solutions) and Jane Ni (For the People). Elijah is a 2nd year Electrical Engineering Major and is new to USAC. Jane is a 3rd year Human Biology and Society Major who has been in USAC for 2 years and is currently a director in the FAC office. 

The controversy around this race revolves around the fact that Jane could potentially have been an "internally elected" candidate, meaning the current FAC office staff (about 40 people) held their own election to choose a successor and then all agreed not to challenge that person. This seems to be a common practice in USAC offices that was made illegal by the election board this year for the first time. 

Elijah Simas has gotten himself in some trouble with the election board over this matter and earned himself the award for the most sanctioned candidate. On a Reddit post that was accusing Elijah for being dishonest and having an unfair advantage (this was claimed citing the first sanction Elijah received for campaigning while collecting signatures), Elijah replied saying Jane was also being dishonest because she was internally selected through a "survey of support." 

Jane then filled a sanction on Elijah for lying and making false accusations. 

Elijah clarified in a Reddit post that he made the claim about Jane based on information provided to him during an office hours meeting with the current FAC, Sachi Cooper. Elijah explained that he assumed Jane was a candidate selected through a survey of support since Sachi had told Elijah she was planning on having this survey. Elijah agreed that a survey of support did not end up happening and apologized to Jane in this post. 

Next, Jane made a post on Instagram talking about how her opponent was spreading misinformation about her candidate status and said she was not internally elected and there was no survey of support. 

After that, the official FAC Instagram and Facebook accounts posted about how the office did not have an internal election and support survey. A fact that had already been acknowledged publicly by Elijah.

Amidst all this, Elijah was handed a sanction by the election board and is currently not allowed to campaign for 8 days. The election board ruled that: "The Board made it clear during Candidate Orientation that false information, and the inclusion of false information, is considered a serious offense that would be investigated to the fullest extent by the Elections Board Investigations Committee. Regardless of whether the inclusion of false information was intentional or unintentional, false information has the potential to damage the reputation of the involved candidates and provide other candidates with an unfair advantage in the election."

What's puzzling to me is that Elijah's so called false accusation was just in one Reddit comment. Why is it being dragged so out of proportion? Also, Elijah posted a clarification on Reddit. Why did the other side post all over Instagram/Facebook but not this audience. Is it fair for such heavily sanction even when the election board agrees that the false information was dispersed unintentionally?

I will be voting for Elijah, I hope you will join me.

Why didn't USAC place all the proposed Constitutional Amendments on the ballot?
A month or so ago, a petition circulated to place several new constitutional amendments on the USAC elections ballot. It didn't receive the requisite 4500 signatures (as no petition ever has) to be placed on the ballot by students, so it was USAC's decision on whether or not to place these propositions on the ballot.

Transfer student representative Zuleika Bravo says in the comments of [this Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/uclatransfers/permalink/10157929251327694/), ["we will let the students decide on the ballot how they wish to vote when it comes to the Constitution because that is how it should be. USAC should not be making that decision."](https://i.gyazo.com/3ef9e1d96450074cddd22cfdd36c2a08.png)

But then today, only 2 of the 10 proposed amendments from the petition made it onto the USAC ballot (questions 2 and 4 from the petition becoming questions 1 and 3 on the ballot).

My question to USAC is, why shouldn't students have the option to vote on most of these amendments? Is letting the students decide on the ballot how they wish to vote when it comes to the Constitution *not* how it should be? Should USAC be the only entity making that decision?
--------------------------------------------------

USAC Amendments
Hello, fellow Bruins!

Does anyone have know how to interpret the constitutional amendments? I read them and have no clue of what to make of them. Are they good? Are they bad? Is the judicial board actually independent and non-biased? Will they really hold anyone accountable? Or are they just part of the USAC circle jerk?

Any information would be appreciated!

...based on numbers from the [USAC Budget Report](https://usac.ucla.edu/docs/budget.pdf) and the [IRS](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/susb.html).

UCLA students also pay the most in undergraduate student government fees compared to [all other UC campuses combined](https://www.ucop.edu/operating-budget/fees-and-enrollments/descriptions-of-charges.html). Our yearly fee is over $300, while that of UCB students is [$33.50](https://registrar.berkeley.edu/tuition-fees-residency/tuition-fees), and UC Riverside students is [$12.50.](https://registrar.ucr.edu/tuition-fees/quarterly-fees#undergraduate_students)

Let‚Äôs Talk Unpaid Internships: I‚Äôm Jacob Keer and I‚Äôm running for EVP with Bruin Solutions
Internships are valuable opportunities for students looking to explore a career path or gain experience in their field of interest. Internships provide key professional experience that bolsters a student‚Äôs resume and allows them to prepare for a future internship or full-time role.

But unpaid internships are straight up terrible. According to a [study](https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/387537-unpaid-internships-unfairly-favor-the-wealthy) by The Hill, around 69% of students claimed they couldn‚Äôt afford to take an unpaid internship.

Less fortunate individuals must often take paid roles that are less useful for their professional situation due to their economic situation necessitating a need for income. Individuals who can therefore afford to work for free are therefore able to get further ahead, exacerbating the issue of inequality.

An [article](https://dailybruin.com/2019/11/12/the-quad-unpaid-internships-provide-valuable-work-experience-but-can-perpetuate-privilege) from Daily Bruin on this fact.

And guess what, unpaid internships harm employers too. They are less likely to achieve a diverse workforce since so many less fortunate students are selected out by default. Interns are also less productive and useful since they might feel less motivated/valued and aren‚Äôt treated as equal to true employees on the payroll; employers can‚Äôt hold unpaid interns to high standards or promote accountability since they aren‚Äôt compensated for their work.

**What can we do? Moreover, what do I want to do?**

**Here are some ideas:**

* **Course Credit Over The Summer:** Lobby admin to let UCLA students who are returning the following year get internship course credit without needing to pay for summer tuition. Not doing so disproportionately negatively impacts lower income students; if students are unable to get paid, they should at least be permitted to get course credit towards their degree over the summer. This is something to collaborate on with the Academic Affairs Commission.
* **Work with the Career Center:** We can look to collaborate with the UCLA Career Center and campus professional organizations (such as UBS) to incentivize firms to offer paid internships rather than unpaid experiences. They have policies that govern everything from who can recruit on campus to how long employers must give students to accept offers; work with the career center to implement policies concerning paid vs unpaid internships (ex. paid internships get first priority in UCLA hiring fairs, unpaid internships must explicitly disclose the lack of pay on all job postings on Handshake, unpaid internships must pay extra fee to be listed through UCLA on-campus recruiting)
   * Furthermore, this looks like working with the Career Center and campus legal organizations to ensure that unpaid internships do not violate laws under the [Fair Labor Standards Act](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/71-flsa-internships) and its 7 principles for employee classification.
* **Co-Op Programs:** We can also look to implement and expand the use of Co-Op programs where UCLA Career Center collaborates with firms to provide meaningful professional experiences for students; specifically oriented towards those who aren‚Äôt able to accept just any unpaid internships, these opportunities would provide valuable learning opportunities and ensure that interns get the most out of their experiences . According to the LA Times: ‚ÄúIn these programs, businesses and universities acknowledge their mutual goals and work together to create new pathways of career training that benefit all parties, including the many young people who‚Äôve been so poorly served by unpaid internships.‚Äù
   * [Here](https://drexel.edu/difference/co-op/how-co-op-works/), you can find how Drexel University‚Äôs co-op program works which has been highly successful 
   * [The LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-fry-unpaid-internships-20150130-story.html) on Co-Op Programs:
   * Currently, it also seems like not many schools offer Co-Op programs, and no UC schools make the [list](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/internship-programs?_sort=rank&_sortDirection=asc) for best universities with internships/Co-Ops.

I‚Äôm a little new to this entire campaign business, so I just recently started figuring this stuff out. Let me know what you think about my ideas.

mcdb upper div requirements?
hello everybody, I am gonna be taking my mcdb upper div major requirements this upcoming fall and I was wondering if any current (or former) mcdb students can recommend which courses I should take  first/together.

I was thinking of taking three courses, preferably mcdb 165A and chem 153A together first. Anybody have any ideas on which other course I should also take with these two, or if I should just take different courses altogether? 

Thank you in advance!

What is it like to be British/European at UCLA?
I'm an American citizen, but I've lived in the UK for the majority of my life and really consider myself more British/European due to my culture, family ties, and accent :P

As such, I was wondering if anyone could tell me a bit more about the following:

* What are generally peoples reactions/attitude towards European students?
* Is the community quite open and flexible or do people stay in close-knit circles?
* Are you at a disadvantage if you don't know anyone from your high school going to UCLA?

And most importantly...

* Will I be able to spell "colour" the correct way on essays???

Any and all comment are appreciated :)

Accellion: Past students and employees
As a past employee or student you should be aware that you may have been affected by the Accellion data breach. I personally know people in this situation who left UCLA a considerable time ago. However, UCLA has failed to notify or warn past employees now for over a month. So, if you were at some point in the past few years an employee I would definitely check my credit report and follow advice here 

https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2021/04/update-on-accellion-breach-and-what-you-should-do.html

UCLA should be more respectful and considerate of its past employees and inform them promptly of the leak and how it affects them. A month or longer delay is unacceptable, and so far there has been no effort to reach past employees.

Should I take Robert Greene for Math 32B?
Robert Greene is the only Professor teaching Math 32B for summer session C, but his reviews are bad and the other posts on Reddit didn‚Äôt seem to say much about his teaching and tests other than his teaching is disorganized and he‚Äôs very conceptual. Debating whether or not I should drop it and just take it over the fall, but don‚Äôt wanna potentially have to take this hard af class closed notes in case we go back lol

Please Remind Your Friends, Clubs, Etc To Vote In The USAC Elections
Voter turnout has been one of the largest problems in recent elections (especially among South Campus students!!!). This leads to a small amount of students (usually associated with a single slate) determining elected officials for the entirety of the school and subsequent policy changes and changes in our student fees.

Last year, CUB was defeated because students outside of the traditional electorate voted. The only reason USAC offices and officers have a presence on Reddit now is because they saw the influence we can have on elections. In order for actual change to happen, we need to make our voices heard again.

Use GroupMes, Discord servers, social media, and whatever else you have to tell your fellow Bruins to vote. Tell them that their vote directly impacts how many actual problems will be solved (on top of whether or not their fees go up and down). This election, like all of them, will determine what kind of impact we want student government will have on us. It's important we all do our part.

Summer Financial Aid
hey yall I asked the financial aid office but they didn't really answer my question so,

&#x200B;

if I apply for summer financial aid for about 14 units, will it lower my financial aid for the actual school year? I'm getting pretty good aid looking at the summer financial aid calculator, but I'm afraid it will lower how much aid I get in the fall.  How did it work for those who have filled out both before? thanks!

Let's talk about campus safety and UCPD
Hey guys I wanted to clarify my views about UCPD and what was said in last night's debate. 

To give some context I was given 45 seconds to answer the following question: *While University of California officials have rejected students' demands to abolish UCPD they said the university should decrease the police budget and reshape officer roles for more accountability. How will you collaborate with both students and administrators to ensure all students feel safe on campus.*

My response included me stating that the current state of policing on campus and in the US as a whole is unacceptable. It doesn't provide safety, it doesn't help marginalized communities and abuse of power is rampant. I brought up additional training for officers and opposing measures such as the Gold Book, which would do the exact opposite of the decrease in the police budget the UC system promised. 

While other candidates pushed for the abolition of police I chose not to say those words for two main reasons

1. Abolish the police means different things to different people. For some people, it means the complete removal of all police forces on campus, and for others is simply means divesting some resources away from the police and towards other services. The exact wording is important and I don't like using phrases with such broad meaning when given only 45 seconds to speak as I believe it turns important policy into meaningless buzzwords.  
2. The question was framed with abolishing the police off the table. Since I was the first candidate to respond, I wanted to stick to answering the question as presented. Part of the reason I am running for USAC is so I can push for concrete policies that are possible to pass.

Now I want to talk briefly about my platform when it comes to campus safety. I have two key initiatives I want to implement if I were elected. 

1. **Westwood Safe Word Program:** Many other college towns have a safe word program in place. I will work with local businesses, notably Rocco's and Barney's, to have a safe word, such as "Go Bruin" for UCLA students. That way if a UCLA student there feels unsafe and endangered. They can approach a bartender or waiter and say something like "Can I get a go bruin?" The employee would be able to help get the student to safety. Whether that means helping that person walk to their car, waiting with them for an uber, or calling the appropriate authority on their behalf. 
2. **Safe Ride Program:** Currently the UCLA Safe Ride program is underutilized and does not serve students many students. I will work with UCLA transportation to create more favorable routes that run at times when students are more likely to use such a service. (Currently, the service only runs til 10:30 PM). I will also explore the possibility of implementing a Free Night Time Uber program for students. Currently, other schools like USC have free Ubers, I hope to bring this to UCLA however still need to look into how such a public-private partnership can be feasible.

Updated USAC Election thoughts
so i got done watching the debates round 2 and wanted to share my updates list of who i am supporting 

TLDR

President: Armaan

Internal VP: Bakur 

External VP: Sarah

Gen Rep: Passa, Alex, and Carl 

Academic Commission: Atharva

Facilities Commission: Elijah

Student Wellness Commission: Brandon

Community Service: Mominah

Campus Events: Maya

Transfer Student: Harmonie 

Financial Supports: Both good

Commentary 

EVP: Overall not much has changed since my last one. I was pleasantly surprised by Jacob Keer, bruin solutions candidate for External VP. He's a great candidate and I enjoyed listening to him speak today. He was late to the debate and like I mentioned before he does not have a social media campaign in place. Sarah was great and has earned my vote. 

Gen Rep: All 12 candidates are great. There's not a single person that I would not be happy with winning. Passa continues to be my favorite and I will be voting for her. Carl really impressed me today as well and I think he will be an important voice as we return to campus. My votes will go to Passa, Carl and Alex but you can't go wrong with any of them. 

Academic: This one is probably the only one that really changed my mind after the debate. Atharva might be the best candidate running for any of the positions and I think he is someone USAC would be lucky to have. Most other candidates use a lot of fancy jargon to describe what they want to do. Atharva doesn't beat around the bush. He has solidly earned my support.

Campus Events: One candidate didn't even show up tonight. Maya has my vote and earned my trust. 

Financial Supports: One of the best debates to watch. Both candidates showed a lot of respect for each other and have a lot of passion for financially supporting bruins. Both also committed to helping each other in the event the opponent wins. Can't choose between either but would be very happy with this person.

Horrific experience that all must see
Hello new students! I was excited too when I got into this place, but not for longüé≠Allow my horrific experience to serve as a warning, especially if you are struggling with any kind of disability illness or stress!

Hi! From a young age, ucla was my dream school. I was extremely excited when I got in in March 2018. Little did I know the horror I would face for the next 2 1/2 years. UCLA gave me (by order of an arrogant man who will not be named of Student Conduct portion of Residential Life, on 17 September 2019), a disabled student who has meltdowns and cries loudly uncontrollably, three hours to leave my university apartment and left a disabled 19-year old homeless. The reason for this was the loud nature of my uncontrollable disability-related meltdowns. I am just stating the facts of my experience because I can‚Äôt keep this bottled up inside me and am unable to return to campus due to the trauma and am forever changed as a result. He went so far as to require me to walk almost a mile to an office to obtain a key to gain access to the apartment to retrieve my essential belongings. The key I was given did not work, and I was forced to wait hours for Residential Life staff to get my belongings (this was in the middle of my Fall classes, while I was forced to sleep in my moms car since I had no place to stay suddenly). My mother had to help with hotels since I was unable to work at the time since the trauma made my disability worse. My mother was unable to even afford her healthcare, the healthcare of my therapy dog, and our basic needs due to this school not offering any support and having to stay in a hotel. The school gave me a list of homeless shelters and food banks (I have several severe food allergies and am on a restricted diet due to my disability). I applied to every school I could think of as a transfer and got rejected by every single one. Now I‚Äôm severely depressed and have to drop out because of the trauma occurred at ucla. I will have to drop out in the fall due to trauma.
--------------------------------------------------
USAC Election Recommendations
I had some time to kill today so I decided to do some research into all the candidates that are running for USAC and wanted to share my thoughts. Just to preface so you know the lens I am coming from, I am a liberal leaning registered Independent. I voted for Joe Biden in November and signed up to vote in the Democratic Primary where I voted for Pete Buttigieg. In my evaluations below, I looked at each candidates social media posts, watched the debate from last night, and read their candidate profiles on the election board website. I'm a fourth year STEM Major (math) and this will be my first time voting in a USAC election. So here it goes. 

President: Armaan Singh 

I really liked many of the Bruin Solution candidates and Armaan is definitely one of my favorites. I think his platforms are very connected to what students like me want to see from USAC, lower fees and initiatives that help everyone across campus. I like adding food stamps to the UCLA store and I think Armaan has shown he will be able to get that done. His platform to reduce UC Ship Copays also stands out. As a country we are moving towards a single payer system and I don't see why the UC system isn't leading that charge. My biggest knock on Armaan would be his lack of experience. But he has mentioned that he's done a lot of research and his responses make it sound like he knows what is going on. The other candidate I really liked was Rutik Shinglot who I will likely rank number 2. Rutik does not have the same robustness in his platforms but I think he has an opportunity to be a good unifying figure on campus. His main appeal to me was his platform of putting bathrooms in parking lots for commuting students, and the absurdly high costs for printing which will be helpful as we return to campus but both of those platforms are shared by many other candidates. His campaign is more put together on Instagram than any other candidate and in the debates he seemed to be the most centrist of all the candidates. I also dig his personality and charisma which is not present in Armaan.  Moises was okay but does not have nearly the depth and understanding as the other 3 candidates. His main platform seems to be "vote for me because I am a first generation low income transfer student." While I agree that brings an important perspective, I don't see him being able to really help students with his platforms. On Breeze, I think some of the criticism against her is unfair. She is a good candidate with the most experience. I did not like how the comments in the debates made it seem like she is entitled to the Presidency. That's a scary precedent. I also was not super found of her platforms. While I think her knowledge will serve her well and help her accomplish these goals, I don't see them directly helping students. Creating a Student Advocate Board sounds like a resume padder. One of her platforms is to help high school students, while thats noble I think thats something any student organization can do. Also she wants to create a Business Administration Minor which I think is something she should've worked on this year if she was the Academic Affairs Commissioner. 

Internal Vice President: Bakur Madini

Another Bruin Solutions Candidate but I did not find him as impressive as the others. He seems to have a good record as ISR but most of which consisted of advocacy and sharing pandemic resources to international students. He also used that office to push USAC transparency. His main platform this time around seems to be reforming USAC which all sounds great and he has a timeline to get it done. I  will vote for him because I think he will leave a big impact on USAC for years to come but I don't think that impact will be felt much by the rest of the student body so I'm not very enthusiastic about this. His opponent, Cassandra Gatica, is the current Assistant IVP but her platform largely seems like she wants to use student fees to push various social justice campaigns. 

External Vice President: Sarah Wang

This time I will be voting for the Independent over the Bruin Solutions candidate. It looks like the EVP is supposed to be the office that does lobbying on behalf of students. Sarah is okay and sounds like a continuation of the current office. I don't see her impacting students directly but I see the importance of pushing on going federal and state policies that help students like expanding the Pell Grant. Jacob Keer with Bruin Solutions does not have an active campaign and I was unable to find anything more about him expect that he is a first year according to his Linkedin. Kuddos to him for the bold move of no suit for his campaign headshot though. 

General Representative: Carl King Jr., Passa Pungchai, Jacob Linder, Alex de Santiago

This one took the longest for me because there's 12 candidates that are running and we get to vote for 3. Most of them are all good candidates with differing platforms. I liked 4 in particular and have not made up my mind yet on the order. Their debates are tonight so that will help. Carl King is a former marine and I think he will bring an important perspective as a gen rep and his platforms will help key groups on campus. Passa is the most qualified candidate in the field. I will for sure vote for her, she has a stem background but will be a unifying figure on council in my opinion with very socially consensus platforms. I like the bathroom platform the most which includes woman's health. Jacob is a computer science major and his platforms will use CS to create tools for the student body. Alex de Santiago impressed me with his platforms and his ability to connect with the general campus body. He's a fun guy who will advocate and create resources for groups on campus like foster students who haven't been represented before. I think he understand why students voted against CUB and that rational perspective will be useful. Passa and Jacob are with Bruin Solutions. Carl and Alex are independents. 

Academic Affairs Commissioner: Atharva Kulkarni

3 experienced candidates in this race. Atharva earned my support because of his emphasize on reducing textbook costs. Although, I think either of the other two candidates will serve students well and I would be happy with any of them.  Each candidate is running with a different slate which is interesting. 

Facilities Commissioner: Elijah Simas

This one is clearest winner and he's my favorite candidate of the field. He has good platforms which include transparency, bathroom upgrades, student retransition program. I spent a lot of time researching this race and the politics are so sad. Elijah is the most sanctioned candidate in the race and it's sad the USAC establishment is going after him. He was first sanctioned for announcing his campaign early but for someone new to USAC its understandable to not know the deadlines. Most of the other sanctions are petty things like missing hashtags. Recently there seems to be a lot of issue over if there were any internal elections for this office. Elijah was told there would be a support survey which he clarified did not happen on here. Now it seems like the other candidate is going for pitty points claiming Elijah was attaching her with misinformation. The official FAC instagram even posted a statement trying to say they had no internal election. But this was a week after Elijah had already said that he agrees there was no internal election. Even if you don't listen to me in any other race, I hope you will in this one. The behavior by the For The People candidate is really sad. 

Here's my recommendation in the last 5 races. I'm tired so don't have the energy to explain my choices on these right now. If there is interest I can later.

Student Wellness Commissioner: Brandon McClelland

Transfer Student Representative: Harmonie Yacob

Community Service Commission: Mominah Subhan

Financial Supports Commission: No Recommendation, both okay candidates. Neither is particularly impressive. 

Campus Events Commission: No Recommendation, both okay candidates. Neither is particularly impressive. 

There's two unopposed races, International Student Representative and Cultural Affairs. Both candidates are good.

My name is Kavya and I'm running for Student Wellness Commissioner!
Hello everyone!

My name is Kavya Juwadi, and I am running to be the next Student Wellness Commissioner. SWC has been one of the most rewarding parts of my college experience and I hope to continue improving this impactful organization as commissioner.

***Please feel free to ask any questions below!***

As a current member of SWC executive leadership, I have first-hand knowledge about the impact of the 11 different committees and associated projects as well as the work that goes into it, which includes working with affiliates, advisory committees, and campus administrators.  As co-director of SWC Student Education and Research on Contemporary Health (SEARCH), I tripled recruitment, introduced multiple new research initiatives, and expanded the scope of the SWC Event Evaluation Program. With irreplaceable experience and commitment to teamwork within SWC, I will support the existing efforts of SWC committees, health-related and cultural organizations, and spearhead new campus-wide health initiatives.

My goal is to increase health and wellness awareness on campus and have more students and student groups utilize SWC‚Äôs resources to enrich their own programs. As a part of the SEARCH‚Äôs Event Evaluation Project, I work on examining committee-specific data, which gives me a thorough understanding of the programming and finances of the different committees the commissioner manages, as well as student feedback about the different programs.

SWC has been such a wonderful experience for me and I'm so excited to continue to work with this commission in the upcoming year. I know the commission inside and out and it would be an absolute honor to serve as commissioner next year.

3-week or 6-week summer course, LS7C
Thinking about taking LS7C in summer session, but both a 3 week and a 6 week option are available. It would be nice to just cram the 3 week one out and have a few extra weeks free in the summer, but I don't know if it'll be too rushed. If anyone has taken one of these 3 week courses could you tell me how it was? Should I just give myself more study time and do the 6 week one? I've heard 7C is the hardest of the 7 series too.

Edit: Ok, thanks guys for the suggestion! Looks like I'll def be doing the 6 week version.

EE 115c incomplete ???
hi, 

my mental health has been pretty shit this year but i guess it got a lot worse recently because somehow its already half way through week 5 and i have a midterm tomorrow but i havent done any homework assignments, im 2 weeks behind on lectures, and i cant even get my computer to log into the software we need for the class and i just dont know what to do anymore. 

someone recommended i try getting an incomplete for the course but im not sure how to go about explaining why i need one since i was under the impression incompletes are used in cases of a family emergency or broken hand and i dont think "i dont want to get out of bed" counts as a valid excuse? its also not the final im skipping so im not sure what kind of accommodations i should be asking for?  

if someone has any experience with situations like this, any advice would be appreciated on how to contact the professor or what the best decision i can make in this case is. thanks in advance

Hello and happy spring to r/UCLA! (I will acknowledge  that it is week five of spring quarter‚Ä¶ hang in there. We got this!)

FIRST! Make sure to request a ballot for the North Westwood Neighborhood Council Elections (UCLA Students can Vote!!) Here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16U02_3y5aIOgNdegGSn6X2Uy98DnpXGnVlMepNmL80I/edit)

I‚Äôm Ayesha [eye-sha] (she/her/hers), a pre-human biology and society major, fan of frogs and the Unknown Mortal Orchestra, longtime r/UCLA enjoyer, and I am excited to let everyone know that I am running independently in the current election for the opportunity to be your general representative.

(You‚Äôre hearing from me a little late due to a midterm season, overcoming Ramadan fasting fatigue, and post-vaccine fever. I promise I‚Äôve been here!)
 
UCLA is an international leader of progress and inclusion, and since I‚Äôve *virtually* stepped onto campus, I‚Äôve tried to involve myself with many ways to advocate to uplift others. I‚Äôve worked to register over 2000 Bruin voters, raise money and media attention regarding food insecurity, and helped advocate for open textbook resources. I‚Äôve lobbied offices of legislators including Kamala Harris to advocate for more funding for college students in the recent COVID relief bill.
 
However, despite my attempts to involve myself in grassroots advocacy on campus, it has been difficult to learn about USAC decisions and processes, let alone of the office as a whole. Especially amidst a pandemic, it was odd to only learn about where some of the miscellaneous fees I had paid on my BruinBill were going more than a quarter afterward. But USAC needs to be a standing champion of making college, which is already a socioeconomic barrier, more accessible. These offices need to make strident change, as apparent from the past year, in alleviating the struggles of marginalized students and uplifting existing student leaders.
 
Bruins deserve comfort in reliable, comprehensive, and intersectional advocacy. I will work to accurately confront concerns, starting with Bruin Well-Being to address both physical and mental health. We have some of the brightest minds across the globe on campus, but students should not be normalizing the regular sacrifice of their health in order to maintain their grades-- we need to implement a support system that reaches students across North & South campus when evaluating academic affairs and potential adjustments. Our academic culture is only part of the UCLA experience. Every student should be able to reach their goals as a Bruin; Accessibility is important on all levels, and appropriate accommodations should not be a barrier for any student.  One of the most daunting barriers as college students is additional costs on top of tuition. I want to create Open-Source Measures on campus to systemically fight food insecurity, high textbook costs, commute and parking penalties, and student homelessness. 
 
We need to use USAC to institutionalize forms of aid, and work with UCSA to combat existing barriers with overwhelming student support. For all of my platforms, I would like to establish flexible task forces, creating an outlet to employ students and also to reduce wait times and red tape between students and essential aid. Most of all, I want to be your advocate-- I work to uplift you. I am not afraid to be confrontational, and will champion resolutions on the basis of Inclusivity and holistic decision-making. 
 
Coming into UCLA by committing in spring of 2020, I learned of USAC through unfortunate circumstances. Though I have not been involved with USAC offices directly thus far, however, the different offices have the potential to enhance the UCLA experience. But this has to involve engaging students that have expressed clear disillusionment with the current culture of operations, in addition to reaching students who don‚Äôt have the connection or immediate proximity to the USAC offices. I need to hear from students outside of USAC before anyone else. It‚Äôs more than listening, though. It‚Äôs about putting your heart into the work and committing to actionable change against comfortable norms.
 
I am excited and honored to run for your UCLA USAC General Representative. If you have any questions, concerns, or want to join my campaign, feel free to message me! #AyeAm #Aye4GenRep
 
(also go to the debates! there was one tonight and will be one tomorrow night, 4/28 and 4/29, streamed on facebook live from @uclausaeboard, at 6pm! post wouldn't go through when I tried to submit it last night so I apologize for the late notice)
 
Voting for the USAC Elections starts FRIDAY!!! And runs from 4/30 to 5/7 via MyUCLA! Vote for the candidates you have faith will best take care of your and our campus‚Äôs needs.

--------------------------------------------------
Alright, I quit
Whaddup fam?! I dropping out! I‚Äôd like to thank all of my professors for showing me I‚Äôve chosen the wrong major. Because My area of interest is in the sciences rather than liberal arts, I‚Äôm going to leave. I‚Äôm excited to follow my dreams and I‚Äôm  legitimately so grateful for the opportunity I had to achieve a goal at UCLA. 

Everyone I‚Äôve spoken to in my breakout rooms seem like genuinely interesting people, all of my professors seem thoroughly dedicated to their fields and I am glad I learned I will never be as passionate as my fellow classmates and professors about English. I actually don‚Äôt even like to read. 

Thank you all for being amazing students and I hope you all achieve greatness in your lives. 

I wanted to share this here because I guess I hoped someone could relate(?) But also to thank the students. ‚úåÔ∏èyou guys are so rad!

Edit for clarity: I‚Äôm a first year transfer and I began my college journey in spring of 2016 after graduating high school early and being forced down a degree path my family wanted me to take. I‚Äôm now taking my time to explore all of my real options.

USAC Presidential Debate Recap
Today the USAC Presidential Debate just occurred on Facebook, and let me tell you that there were definitely some highlights. Let's take a look at what happened...

**Breeze**

\- Shotgunned a "Bang!" energy drink and then let out a monstrous burp that could have probably killed my great grandma (if she was still alive). When asked by a confused officiant why she did that she said "I LIKE TO START THINGS OFF WITH A BANG!"

\- When Breeze was asked what she sees as her greatest skills and weaknesses are, she rapped the entirety of Busta Rhymes' verse from the 2011 hit song "Look At Me Now"

\- Concluded her speech by leveling with the student body: "We USAC candidates are just like you, the only difference is that we know which words the abbreviation 'USAC' stands for"

&#x200B;

**Teek**

\- Spent the first 2 minutes of his time fumbling around his desk saying "I can't find my glasses! Shaggy help!" in front of a stunned audience. He then snapped out of character and asked everyone to rate his Velma Dinkley impression (I'd give it an 8/10).

\- The debate moderator asked about abolishing UCPD and he couldn't stop laughing about how they said "U-C-P"

\- Said he will do everything in his power to get all students a sleeve of saltine crackers at the beginning of each quarter if he is elected. He further acknowledged that this may be a suboptimal use of student fees but it's better than what they're doing so far.

&#x200B;

**Armaan**

\- Sat there eating pistachios with the shells on for half his time. It was pretty metal.

\- Several times he emphasized that he would much rather be at Westwood Denny's. He was worried that the debate would run long and Denny's would close.

\- When asked why he deserves the student vote he shrugged and said "Powell Dog?"

&#x200B;

**Moises**

\- Livestreamed his debate from a hot tub while wearing a sick chain and he kept doing finger guns at the camera and saying "I'm Moises and I'm the Moistest!"

\- Seemed very determined to crack down on campus JUULers. He said the #2 problem that faces our campus is JUULing in the library. When asked what the #1 problem is he said "JUULing in the bathroom"

\- Concluded his speech with "A Vote for Moises is a Vote for Moises!" And honestly I don't see how you could disagree with that.

Thank you Professor Mclean ily
The average on the first physics 5c midterm was a 95% and he was so happy for us. Like this man is a godsend who doesn‚Äôt make his exams so unreasonably hard and actually wants us to get good grades and get As. He cares more about us learning than making super difficult tests. I was so scared for 5c but it‚Äôs a class I know I can pass with a good grade and I absolutely love Mclean for that he‚Äôs amazing üò©. I do think it‚Äôs his last quarter teaching so sorry to people who haven‚Äôt taken him :(.

any UCPD supporters in here?
Seriously, what's the huge anti-UCPD circle jerk? I'm backin' the blue 110%. Blue lives matter. UCPD does a hell of a job and for them to be shat on by a bunch of woke dipshits is an embarrassment. Shame on you all. 

UCPD does their job and protects students.

Econ 41 Midterm
Hiya, does anyone have any practice midterms for Econ 41? I‚Äôm trying to get my practice in but since the test bank isn‚Äôt open, I can‚Äôt get ahold of any additional material. It would be super helpful if I can get my hands on a few. 

Also, any general advice for the midterm? Lowkey kinda anxious since everyone complains about this class. For context, I‚Äôm taking it with Chetverikov so if anyone has had him before, any comments will be super helpful!! Thanks yall :) Good luck with midterms

All the screw ups in the USAC Presidential Debate
Today the USAC Presidential Debate just occurred on Facebook, and let me tell you that there were definitely some highlights.  Let's take a look at what happened...

Breeze

1. Spoke at 2x speed, effectively listening to a chipmunk
2. Admitted to wanting to raise USAC fees even more for students
3. Set the world record for talking the most without actually saying anything

Teek

1. Famous phrase: "Make UCLA Great"
2. Now leader of the #MUGA movement
3. May make a wall around UCLA

Armaan

1. "Do you want to abolish the police at UCLA?" -> "No let's give them more training"
2. Effectively spoke as a robot, sounds like he speaks in text to speech
3. Most hated by the facebook chat

Moises

1. Sounded like he cared the most in the debate, but was just flat out nervous
2. Famous phrase "A vote for Moises is a vote for student voices"
3. \^ at the end he screwed it up and said "A vote for Moises is a vote for student Moises"

&#x200B;

Just some random other things...

1. Hosting moderators sounded like they really didn't want to be there
2. Lots of FTP followers in the Facebook chat very heavily supporting Breeze
3. \^ same people making fun of r/ucla
4. Some random troll account in facebook chat

&#x200B;

What an interesting debate! Highly recommend rewatching via facebook. It's crazy thinking one of these people is going to be our next USAC president... with a budget of $8 million...

Professor not responding to regrade request emails
Hi, I just wanted to ask if there's anything I can do if a professor doesn't respond to my regrade email requests. In cs32, I ran some test cases that I supposedly failed on my own computer, and it turns out that I passed those test cases. The project grade was released about a week ago, and the professor still hasn't responded to my request after 3 follow-up emails.  Any help is appreciated!

Professor Shoarinejad appreciation post
I have him for ECE113 and he is so awesome. Not only is he a great lecturer and prepares really neat handouts for the class, but he is on the class discord channel literally 24/7 answering everyone's questions about the material and dropping hints on the homework. He even answers DMs on specific HW questions!! He's also giving us all a 6 hour extension on the midterm and changing the release time to accommodate everyone better. 

I don't think he has much reviews on Bruinwalk but you should absolutely take ECE113 with him if you really want to learn the material well. ECE113 is a pain in the ass because the workload is really heavy, but Professor Shoarinejad makes it so much better and I'm really learning the material even though I lowkey BS'ed ECE102. I LOVE THIS MAN

USAC debates: Why you should attend?
Debates will be held April 28th and 29th (today and tomorrow) at 6pm PST both days. They are co-hosted by Daily Bruin and the UCLA Elections Board

You can watch on FB Live [https://www.facebook.com/uclausaeboard](https://www.facebook.com/uclausaeboard)

We encourage you to go pop in for a little bit since those are the folks who will be on USAC next year. They will be the people in charge of your money, the bureaucracy, events, projects, grants etc.

We've been campaigning for a little while now, but this is a chance to show you that we're worth voting for over the other candidates. But nonetheless, we encourage you to keep an open mind.

Love us or hate us, we hope you give us a chance.

Voting starts on Friday. #bruinsvote

If you have any questions for us, that don't get asked in the debate we are always more than happy to try to answer them.

Will the exams of Math dept be easier when it‚Äôs not remote learning?
Hi everyone,
I joined UCLA after the pandemic had begun, so every Math courses I have attended so far gave me 24 hours for each exam. However, some of the exams were designed to be finished in 3 hrs which I ended up using 6-10 hrs finishing them. I‚Äôm wondering if our professors gave us harder exams than usual bc they know we have 24 hrs for it, or it is the same level of difficulty compared to exams when normal.
Thanks for any thoughts :)

Disliking ENGL 10A as a Possible English Major
(Current freshman) I was just hoping I could get a bit of insight on this issue, mainly from other English majors :/ 

I‚Äôm in ENGL 10A (Old English lit) and I really dislike almost everything about it. Unfortunately, it feels like I‚Äôm the only one that does. A lot of people in class engage with the prof and connect with the pieces, even in my discussion section the majority of the students seem to know what‚Äôs going on. 

I‚Äôve taken English lit classes before (usually from maybe 1700s-present?) and have felt fine, even excelled, but this was at a community college. I‚Äôm just worried I might be out of my league with these English classes at UCLA, or the English program is not what I thought it would be. I‚Äôm doing pretty fine, as far as the papers, but I‚Äôm not passionate about any of it with a simultaneous onslaught of imposter syndrome. 

So, basically, I‚Äôm just wonder if anyone had a similar experience or if I should start rethinking my whole college career üòî

Rant about Zoom Chat feature
Honest question, but am I the only one who gets irritated when people flood the zoom chat with unrelated material? Like why? Why in a calculus class would you think it's okay to start talking about the moon and then people who respond bother me too. Why would you encourage the student and continue this conversation going publicly? That is honestly so disrespectful to the professor who is teaching and doing their best to lecture and keep up with the chat for any questions. Now they got to decide whether to pay attention to the chat or not. Most times they don't because of your stupid comments. On top of that every time you send a message to the chat it pops up and blocks the screen where the professor is showing their work. Even if you try to move the chat box to the side it doesn't fix the issue because it's now blocking the side work. I don't know if this happens because maybe it's a class of 1st/2nd years but come on guys, we're supposed to be mature adults. I don't feel like having a message pop up where you brag about the game or tv shows or how you're the baddest b\*\*\*. Please grow up and use the chat for the intended purpose. Anyone feel like this?

Changing Major to CS ?
Hi, 

I'm really conflicted on whether I should change my major to CS or not. For reference, I am currently a freshman majoring in Math of Comp and have completed CS31, 32, and doing CS33 right now. My career aspiration is to be involved in the tech field, preferably becoming a data scientist. 

My concern is that I do find myself somewhat enjoying programming for fun, but I pretty much did not enjoy myself in CS31 and CS32. I was just super stressed from the endless projects and material :/. Knowing this, should I still apply to change my major or will that make my next few years unenjoyable?

Moving on campus next month!!!
Hi y‚Äôall, I‚Äôm moving on campus next month (into the co-op) and wanted to see if anyone has any advice as I make this transition? What do you wish you would have known about living at UCLA/Westwood when you got there? Just any overall advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks üôè

Physics ---> Music Industry ??
Hi! I'm a freshman physics major (I took a gap quarter for winter, so I've only done 2 quarters at UCLA so far). I want to switch to a music industry major. I applied for a double major last Fall but I got rejected and they said it was because the workload would be a lot (and I know my application could have been better). But now I want to switch entirely to Music Industry. So I have a few questions:

1. Do they usually allow major changes that require a change of schools within ucla?
2.  Should I take all music hist and industry courses in the fall or stick to physics classes in case I get rejected ?
3. Can I apply for the music hist and industry major AND minor at the same time in case I get rejected from the major?
4. Do I count as a sophomore in Fall since I've only done 2 quarters or am I still a freshman?

I‚Äôm not here to try to get sympathy upvotes or get advice from people on the internet. I don‚Äôt think most people are capable of helping when it comes to heavy topics. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with anyone for not knowing how to help. I just wish to not be seen as someone who is unwilling to help themself. I get uncomfortable when anyone suggests CAPS to me. I don‚Äôt hold these well intentioned actions against anyone however. I feel a sense of social rejection when I see people talk about promoting mental health awareness because I feel I‚Äôll be put down if I share anything that contradicts their personal attitudes toward therapy.

Taking CS 33 equivalent at CC

How to Complain about USAC - The Right Way
Let‚Äôs talk about why USAC is bad. And how we can fix it. Because it does exist and has the capacity to provide substantial value to students.

So it has been about a year into being a council member with the CCI slate serving as the International Student Representative (ISR) and throughout the year I naturally had to interact with all council members. Now, to answer a question many of have wondered about for a long time: Is USAC corrupt? The answer is yes and no. How?

It is simple, council members in general (at least this year) even the ones I greatly differ with in terms of policy are well intentioned, but 1) well-intentioned people don't always produce the right results 2) The system rather than the people is corrupt. Expanding on each point:

1. It is not possible for a few people to get every perspective or understand the policy implications of each decision and mostly try to use their best judgment which is not always right especially with lack of concrete data that would allow for data-driven decisions. Does that make council members less responsible? Obviously No.¬†
2. As for the system itself, by virtue it is a closed one as it contains only 15 members most of them are commissioners and every time we want to ensure the representation of a specific population (i.e transfers and internationals) a constitutional amendment is needed and guess what the campaign to have that doesn't always succeed (the ISR was created after the second try). We need more STEM majors, heck one transfer or international representative is not enough to represent such diverse populations. Additionally, 60% of USAC work is operations and bureaucracy which is not the most appealing thing to the student body. Combining how USAC is closed, its bureaucracy, and how hard it is to get into makes USAC lacking in its outreach and relevance to all student populations. This also affects how many and who gets to know about USAC opportunities and benefit from them (such as finding bodies).¬†

In addition to the issues mentioned above, we all agree that USAC has a ton of issues and up until now most candidates have been trying to tackle the symptoms rather the illness itself by doing bylaw changes and starting initiates, but bylaws can be changed from a year to another and initiatives even by the Office of the President can be easily discontinued by the next officer. What we need is to reimagine and shake the whole USAC system upside down, and that is what I plan to do. How?

Well, that relates to two of my platforms, that I am running on for the Internal Vice President, as follows:

1. Reform: I plan to switch USAC into a senate system, what does that mean? There will be 30-40 student senators who will have the final say in allocations and would administer oversight over the executive branch which would be the current commissions and focus on operations. The commissioners will be nominated by the president and approved by the senate. Additionally, the Judicial Board will be completely independent and USAC won't be able to overrule them as they can do now. The Election Board will have more autonomy. The senate body will have a mix of restricted seats for International, transfer, daca, out of state, and college representatives in addition to members-at-large (similar to the current gen reps). This would ensure a larger, more open, and inclusive body that is more representation of our undergraduate population. I also intend to digitize most of USAC processes to ensure accessibility, streamlining bureaucratic processes, and more transparent (through public automated dashboards).¬†
2. Accountability: Since the time I worked with Orion in the Gen Rep II Office I worked on the analysis of USAC budget and as the ISR the Technology team at my office developed a budget viewer based on this analysis that categorizes and details USAC budget in details for several years. However, analyzing and making the data early presentable is just the first step. Being able to use this data to improve the efficiency of allocating USAC funds is next. To achieve that, we will focus on the last 3 years and conduct a full budgetary review including but not limited to allocations, surplus use, and student-fee levels in consultation with communities benefiting from those fees by October 30.

It is easy to list USAC problems (I mean they are just too many) and feel free to list more in the comments. If you have questions about how to complain correctly, let me know, I‚Äôll try to help.

I‚Äôm running for IVP with Bruin Solutions and my goal is to try to fix some of these endemic problems.¬†

Just bombed a CS33 midterm - do I still have a chance of getting an A
I just did my first CS33 midterm and somehow my brain decided that I had to interpret an mov instruction as an lea instruction. I wasn't able to get an answer at all for the first question which was 30 points out of a 100. I'm quite sure I did the rest of the test fine and will probably get 70/100. Since Reinman's class seems to be curved to give the top 50% an A and everyone in the class seems to be doing really well, is there any chance of me still getting an A/A+? I feel like most people probably got 100 on this midterm given people were leaving early.

[This](https://dailybruin.com/2020/01/20/editorial-millions-of-dollars-unaccounted-for-in-usac-committees-funded-by-students) is what happens when you put young and inexperienced people in charge of millions of dollars in student fees. We still don't have answers to those millions of OUR MONEY that went missing, btw.

Robert Watson (former USAC president) said last year: ‚ÄúNo students know where this money is, there‚Äôs no transparency to students, but (student committee members) were the ones that voted over this money, created these committees and who said that they wanted to lead these committees."

Chem 30C Midterm
Was it just me who thought that midterm was bad? I was not prepared for such a long exam for an hour. I thought I had prepared well for the exam as well, but after the first page and I saw how long the exam was I seriously cracked under pressure. Definitely one of my worst tests...just wanted to know if anyone else get similar or if other people have been in the same position before.

Every time I try not to think about the exam it slowly creeps up on me and i realize how hard I choked on that test.

Thanks for listening to my rant/fail.

Internship tips? Can't get an interview
I'm a second year Poli Sci major trying to get some kind of summer internship (don't care what it is-- could be law, communications, marketing, politics, etc) and have been using handshake to apply to stuff. Everything that I've applied to (4 internships thus far, one at a congressman's office, one doing communications stuff for an NGO, two that were incredibly general) says its for second year students to graduating seniors, and I haven‚Äôt even been offered an interview at any of them.

While I don't have much office/clerical experience, I do have a lot of work experience (worked at wooden, head camp counselor over the summer, that kind of thing), I'm lucky enough where my GPA is almost perfect, and I'm involved in two campus orgs-- one where I have a pretty significant management/leadership position. I'm a strong writer and I think all the samples I send in are really good. 

At the risk of sounding arrogant and cocky, I guess I wonder who is snagging these internships? I'm fine with not getting the role but I'm a little turned off that I can't even get interviews. Are there recent college grads that are picking these up (due to the job market being tough), or are there people my/our age that are significantly more qualified to the point where people like me are completely not considered?  Should I lower my standards a lot and apply to much more menial internships? 

thanks

Should I feel guilty for not caring about learning in class?

i think i just bombed my midterm fml 153c
i feel so awful right now. i woke up thinking this midterm was going to be ok.

i know i should've studied more, but this was probably the hardest exam i've taken the past year. maybe online class has made me dumber (highly likely) but idk i'm so sad.

didn't even finish 19% of this test. and the class isn't curveeeeedddd fuck my lifeeeeeee

i just want to graduate on a high note ;A;

REPOSTING: USAC is toxic and everyone should stay away
I have removed the names and included only titles this time. 

I know this Reddit is already fed up with the abundance of USAC posts and I am sorry to add to the mess. I made a new account to expose some of the toxicity that has been created in one usac office in particular that‚Äôs been of discussed here recently. I‚Äôm currently a staff member in the facilities commission and feel like a lot needs to be said and accountability needs to take place by current leadership. The facilities commission currently has a culture of toxicity, emotional abuse, mental abuse, and so much more. I‚Äôve seen my peers yelled at in the commission. Seen people threatened and seen leadership take some extreme measures in order to protect their power. This was my first usac experience and I do not understand how preserving power in fucking student government is so important. First I want to clarify that FAC did not have an internal election. FAC also did not have any survey. Unless, these things happened with leadership only and me as a staff member was not included. What fac did was corner out other potential candidates or anyone that even expressed interest in running. The current candidate running with For the people slate was chosen by some members of leadership which for sure included the commissioner herself . Once this decision was made if anyone even thought of supporting anyone else, they were threatened. I know of one girl who was abused out of running. I do not know this girl personally as we were in separate departments but it is common knowledge throughout the commission that she was also going to run but did not run because of pressure from the commissioner and her best friend and chief of staff. When leadership in FAC learned that another candidate who is running with the Bruin Solution slate was going to run for FAC as well, people in the commission were warned to not speak to him or help him out in anyway. This abuse and protection of power is astonishing. If you know anyone in FAC currently, they will confirm everything I have said. Lastly for the sake of everyone‚Äôs health, I encourage future freshman and other considering getting involved in USAC to stay away. It is not worth the energy and time. Usac does not accomplish anything. I know my department didn‚Äôt.

Opposing Mandatory Inspections
**Opposing the UCLA Penis Inspection Mandate**  
  
For the UCLA Community:  
  
We urge you to complete this form to make your voice heard in opposing mandatory penis inspections at UCLA. To this end, we have prepared an email template for your convenience. Feel free to edit with other arguments or if you feel like including more details on any aspect (e.g. bodily autonomy, legal arguments). Please send an email to our chancellor.  
  
My name is ________, and I am a ___ year ________ major (or other affiliation). I am writing to you to demand that UCLA students be given the right to refuse penis inspection under the ethical principle of informed consent. Given that all penis size requirements are currently not approved and only authorized for emergency use (EUA) by the FDA, it is a violation of FDA guidelines and federal law (69 U.S. Code ¬ß 8====D) to mandate 6.7 inch penises. As informed consent is the foundational issue in dick measuring ethics, it would not only be unlawful but highly immoral to mandate x-ray penis inspection machines known to induce severe side effects.  
  
The long term side effects of penis inspections are unknown. With reports of blood clots associated with the Johnson & Johnson tag-team inspection, the BBC subsequently discontinued its practice. From this, there is legitimate doubt as to whether or not the safety of an otherwise healthy individual would be assured. As of April 2021, the BBC has reported that those in the 18-29 age group had a penile-size average of 5.12 inches.  It is thus unethical to impose such a mandate on students who would rather take their chances with their 5 inches than experience unknown and potentially egregious side effects.  Students that refuse inspection would not pose a risk to others, since those with penises that have measured above 6.7 inches will be provided with highly visible badges, making others aware of their adequacy.   
  
Additionally, in the case that mandated penis inspections are fully approved by the FDA, I demand that exemptions be made for religious students who have been forsaken by their lord and have not received enough love in their package. Since religious exemptions were made possible for the 2020-2021 mandated testicle exams, there is no valid reason why a similar exemption should not be offered for the penis inspections.    
  
I demand that you reconsider your efforts to mandate penis inspections, and provide students the option to refuse examination prior to returning to in-person instruction.  
  
Sincerely, __________

What happens if I drop a summer class after I fill out the Summer financial aid application?
It says I could be charged but like how does that work? Will they give me money based on what's on the summer app and then ask me to return some of it or will they charge an additional amount for changing it? I wouldn't drop all the classes, I'm just thinking I might drop one of them. Would this look bad in some way?

A statement on USAC elections.
I want to take a moment to clarify some previous statements made by my campaign due to misinformation that was provided to me. I would also like to use this moment to apologize to my opponent, Jane Ni, as she fell victim to the misinformation that was provided to me. Before the start of my campaign, I met with the current Facilities Commissioner (FAC) to learn more about this USAC office. In that conversation, I asked if the current Commission was going to hold an internal election to decide who would seek the office in the spring election. This has been a common practice in USAC offices and commissions and has only become a violation of the Election Code recently. I was notified by the current commissioner that FAC would not be holding an internal election, but that there would be a ‚Äúsurvey of support.‚Äù While the survey of support did not happen, I was never notified of this change by the Facilities Commissioner. When I posted a comment on Reddit in response to a slanderous post made about me, I incorrectly claimed that my opponent was an internal pick through a survey of support. I made this statement because I assumed that since Jane was currently involved in the commission, she had received positive feedback in the ‚Äúsurvey of support‚Äù that happened. As I‚Äôve learned recently, this was not the case.

Also, for those that love filing sanctions on me, Notice of Findings Number 39 was [retracted](https://imgur.com/a/J4mM50l) by the Election Board at 11:40 pm PST. Therefore there are no active sanctions against me.

Opposing Mandatory Vaccination
I know that vaccines are important and especially now so with COVID. However, UCLA forcing students to get the COVID vaccine in order to return to campus in the fall (after doing online school for over a year now) is just plain wrong as it not only violates certain religious beliefs, it also completely rejects the notion of bodily autonomy and a person's right to choose what happens to their body as well as brings up many ethical dilemmas.

This is the following email sent out by a student group on campus to fight against UCLA's mandatory COVID vaccine policy.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Vaccines are a great thing...[but] nobody should be forced, we have our freedoms.¬†- President Donald¬†Trump

ATTENTION: We are emailing to notify you of the current proposal by the UCLA administration to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for all students who wish to return to campus for in-person instruction. The Bruin Republicans strongly oppose any form of compulsion or coercion regarding the receival of experimental vaccines. A drafted release by our organization detailing the issues with this proposed mandate can be viewed below. As UCLA associates and community members, we urge you to take action against mandatory experimental vaccinations by voicing your concerns using the email template also listed below. We can not stress this enough as it is extremely important that the concerns of the larger community are documented. The link will redirect you to a GoogleDoc containing the message for the email, including instructions and the appropriate recipients of the e-letter.¬†

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

P.S: I am not an anti-vaxer and in support vaccines but support a person's freedom to choose what is beast for their own health more than forced vaccination.

Any one else having graduation audit issues after going to UCCS?
There's a glitch or something in the audit program or something that's making it basically impossible to graduate if you did UCCS in your last 3 quarters at UCLA (something called "Letters and science academic residency requirement"). I know at least one other person having problems with this, idk if anyone else is running into this? It's really annoying as I completed every other graduation requirement, but it wants 35 of my last 45 units to be done 'in residency', even tho as a Fall19 transfer that was literally the only time I had to study at UCCS. The audit office said they'd "get back to us" on it.

Full Guide to UC Data Breach and How to Protect Yourself
Been noticing slight panic about this so I thought I‚Äôd make a guide on how to protect yourself. First let me note that data breaches are becoming increasingly common. Chances are that you‚Äôll likely be a part of at least a couple in your lifetime if nothing fundamentally changes with the system. Most people‚Äôs sensitive information ends up on the dark web at one point or another.

There are two main areas of concern that I‚Äôll focus on in protecting yourself. The first is preventing new accounts from opening in your name - credit cards, loans, or anything that could have financial consequences. The second is protecting current accounts that you have - bank accounts, investment accounts, etc.

For preventing new accounts from opening, the best thing you can do is freeze your credit. They should provide you a pin or passcode that you can call them to unfreeze it with when you need to. This includes instances such as when you apply for an apartment or buy a car. What I‚Äôll note is that you should NOT save this pin or passcode electronically. This includes putting it in your iPhone notes or putting it in a word/notepad file. The best thing to do is to physically write it and hide it somewhere like a safe. 

If you don‚Äôt want to freeze your credit, than you can also sign up for something like credit karma (free). With their app/website you can see all credit cards and loans that you have, and they will also send you push notifications if new ones appear. They also let you know if someone is TRYING to open something with your identity from a hard inquiry, such as pretending to be you to get a apartment, Internet service account, etc.

For protecting your current assets there are two main things you should do. First is to set up two factor authentication on all your important financial accounts, and emails. This means they can only access your account, even if they have your password, by also getting access through your phone. However identity thieves already have your ssn, address, etc, since it‚Äôs on the dark web so what they‚Äôll do is call your phone provider and say you lost your phone or it was stolen. They will then get a new SIM card for your number and use that to get through two factor authentication. They can also use this to reset your passwords if they don‚Äôt actually know them. So what you need to do is call your phone provider (if it‚Äôs through your parents plan, have them call) and set up a pin. Say ‚ÄòI want no changes to my account unless I give this pin‚Äô. Again do not electronically save this pin.

These steps should protect you from the majority of cases of identity theft attempts. If anything does happen, don‚Äôt panic. It would likely be a pain in the ass, but chances are that if it wasn‚Äôt your fault things would resolve eventually.

UC Breach
I saw a lot of people had their SSNs compromised, so I decided to sign up for an experian account. And found that mine had been released as well, on 4/13. Panicking, I changed all my passwords for my emails and bank account, and after I logged back into experian, it said, "Good news! We monitored your personal information for signs of possible identity theft, and did not find a match."

I'm very confused on whether I should relax or not?? Has this happened to anyone else? On the one hand I want to believe that I sort of fixed it (will still be vigilant of course) and I hope this works for others as well, but is it really that easy?

So they shaft us with no guaranteed housing and then they shaft us with no meal plans? Not sure if they aren't offering meal plans across the board but this is just downright ridiculous. The UCLA committee and Gene Block should be ashamed of themselves. Let's punish our students and charge them up the ladder just to attend our school. Let's not give them any benefits. I know to a lot of you guys this seems like a stupid rant but my transfer class has probably suffered the most. Yes seniors I know you guys have it rough too. It'll be the last year on campus for those who aren't pursuing graduate school and UCLA offers us no benefits whatsoever. I find it to be shameful and incredibly disappointing.

writing a philosophy paper
is painful! lol i‚Äôm writing my first philosophy paper ever for a midterm due on monday and i‚Äôm stressed because i don‚Äôt even know if what i‚Äôve written is good. i‚Äôve found a couple of helpful resources that explain how to write a philosophical paper but i‚Äôm struggling to really think about what to say. i‚Äôm so worried that i‚Äôm gonna do so bad on this paper and i‚Äôm also stressed out because i have a lab midterm on the same day the paper is due (which i am shocked to say will probably come out much better than this.) any words of encouragement would be appreciated :‚Äô)

I just fucked up
In CS 31 I received a terrible score and I realized it‚Äôs because I fucked up on how to write a certain sentence.

Please give me some advice. I feel so demoralized right now. I‚Äôve been busting my ass this term with extra credits and now seeing 8% of my grade go down the drain hurts.

The code was so easy to write too. I just fucked up miswriting some output sentence and when they auto graded it none of the tests worked.

What do I do

For those whose SSN have been leaked or is just overall anxious about the whole data breach: Steps
See if you guys actually got an email from ucla that your data has been leaked. If you have follow UCLA's instruction to sign up for experion and monitor any fraudulant activity. If you haven't, your good.

Now, lets say your nervous bc what if your too late and your just anxious about this whether they have your ssn or not. Then, intiate a credit freeze at all 3 of the natl credit bureaus( experion, transunion, and equifax). Its really simple, just a quick registration and you should be able to enable it. This will prevent a 3rd party indv from having access to your credit report which helps to prevent someone from using your identity to open credit cards, lease a car, etc.

Now, that you've done that heres just a quick side note. Someone having access to your ssn isnt something new. You practically hand it out for a lot of things, school, official documents, leasing, etc and those receiving it are random people as well. Also, keep in mind unless you actually have a good credit score(700-800), I would say its hard to open anything under your name.
--------------------------------------------------
UC data breach
transfer ‚Äò22 for reference. signed up for the Expedian thing to they sent out to check if mine was breached and it wasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of people say theirs was, so I‚Äôm honestly confused how all of our ssn‚Äôs weren‚Äôt stored in the same place. I‚Äôm just curious what were the surrounding factors to why some socials were breached and whose were/weren‚Äôt. idk seems fishy 2 me.

so can we just create a "my ssn was found on the dark web" club at ucla? seems about fitting at this point

COVID vaccine will be required at UC (if proposed policy passes)
It's being widely reported in the news today that the COVID vaccine will be required at UC campuses for faculty, students, and staff.  I just took a look at the UCOP website and it talks about a proposed policy being reviewed that would make it mandatory (so it's not quite mandatory yet, but likely to be. Enforcement of the policy would require the COVID vaccine(s) to receive FDA approval - not just EUA authorization - so not sure when that would be).

subject to dismissal/readmission confusion (help!!)
Hi yall, after an extremely difficult period during the past couple months when my mental health went out of control, I was not able to complete winter quarter and completely detached myself from anything school related. I have not checked my email or dealt with anything academic for weeks, but when I did a couple days ago I saw that I was placed on Subject to Dismissal status. I am devastated that college has gone this way and wanted to clarify what would happen if I were to be dismissed? Is there an opportunity to come back and complete my degree (I am very close to doing so already) or does dismissal mean that I am permanently dismissed from being a ucla student?

I am still inching along in my recovery and it is super overwhelming to have multiple departments on campus contacting about my financial aid being suspended, enrollment, major requirements, etc. So i really would just like to know whether my ucla journey will be over if I am dismissed or whether there will still be an opportunity for coming back?

Thanks in advance for any answers! :)

BruinBus Expansion: Saving Student Money & Saving Students Time
Hi everyone, today I wanted to share my platform about expanding the UCLA BruinBus and how this can **save students money** through cheaper apartments rents and free rides to LAX.

**Part 1a: Access to More Apartments**

It‚Äôs no secret that UCLA has one of the highest apartment rent prices in the entire country. Students end up paying anywhere from $700 to $1200 a month only to live in a 800 sq. feet apartment with 3 to 4 other Bruins.

Is there something UCLA can do to reduce costs of rent? Yes and no. While the high costs of rent is an issue for local, state, and federal policy makers, UCLA does have the power to alleviate some of the rent burden by expanding the BruinBus program. How? Well currently many UCLA students are restricted to either living in the apartments by the hill or apartments near Wilshire Ave where the BruinBus currently runs. If we expand this bus service to apartments further south of Wilshire Ave, students will be able to have more apartments to choose from. Currently apartments south of Wilshire Ave are already about $800 cheaper compared to similar counterparts near the hill (source: I looked at over 20 different apartments and currently live south of Wilshire). Looking at sites like apartments.com and Zillow, apartments further south are on average $400 cheaper, students currently do not rent that far since they would not have any means to quickly get to campus. If we increase access to campus by running the BruinBus shuttle to these apartments, students would be incentivized to live there. This would mean that an average person living in a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom, 4 person apartments can save $300 a month. By increasing the supply of apartments that students have access to, we would also decrease the demand for apartments near the hill, hopefully making a dent in their price as well.

**Part 1b: UCLA Student Friendly Leases**

Another common reason students don‚Äôt rent apartments in some parts of Westwood is that the current leases terms do not fit a student‚Äôs timeline. No UCLA student is going to rent an apartment where the lease runs from February to January. Students typically will seek out leases that run from July to June or other summer months since that best fits the UCLA academic calendar. As president, I will work with landlords to ensure they offer more student friendly lease terms.

**Part 2: Making sure UCLA honors the LAX/Union Station Shuttle agreement**

The last part of my BruinBus expansion platform is to ensure that UCLA honors it‚Äôs pre-pandemic commitment to run a shuttle for students to LAX and Union Station at the beginning and end of every quarter. In 2020, when Orion Smedley was elected to USAC he successfully advocated for the return of a shuttle to LAX and Union Station. This would save students nearly $30 a trip with the high costs of Ubers. As president, I will ensure that UCLA honors this commitment to students once we return back to campus.

**In Conclusion**

The USAC President has unique access to administration that allows them to advocate for various student needs (the president even gets to meet once a quarter with Gene Block ). If elected I will leverage my position to push these reforms through collaboration with administration, the North Westwood Neighborhood Council, and the City of Los Angeles Department of Transportation. Through my research, it appears that USAC has not had the best relationship with UCLA administration. While I agree that it is part of USAC‚Äôs job to hold administration accountable when decisions are made that contradict student interests, I also think that USAC is most effective when they work closely with administration to see reforms through. As someone that has experience working closely with administration at UCLA Health for various research projects and work with student organizations, I believe I will be an effective in restoring and building USAC‚Äôs relationships with admin.

I want to hear your guys' thoughts on this project. Where would you want the BruinBus to be expanded? How can we help expand transportation for you?

As always, I want to find solutions for you all. Stay tuned with **Bruin Solutions** for more information on our platform.

Withdrawing for a term Questions
I am an undergrad engineering student looking to withdraw this quarter. ( Zoom university has taken a toll on my mental health). The withdrawal form says I need to obtain a school signature. How do I go about obtaining a school signature. Also the registrar's website says I should send the notice to their physical office. So should I just mail the notice to them? or would it be okay to email it to them?
--------------------------------------------------
Only taking 1 class
Is it possible to withdraw from every class except 1? I‚Äôm going through a difficult time medically and school is a bit too much, but I don‚Äôt want to drop the class I am in thats only offered once a year. I want to drop everything else. Is this possible?

Ugh anyone else feel this?

I miss all the fun parts of campus but I'm BIG scared of my major upper divs and having to work/volunteer again, I kinda just want to remain a recluse taking classes and then immediately doing nothing but the bare minimum (but I don't).

I am afraid
This is such an irrational fear but basically, two of my closest friends are hardcore pre-meds. Like their entire lives revolve around being pre-med and getting into med school. Now, I lowkey have been thinking about going back to being pre-med this year, but I haven't told anyone and honestly, I'm scared of telling my friends because what if they aren't supportive?? Like I know how hard it is but what if they don't think I'm smart enough lol. Or even worse what if they stop helping me out because they see me as completion?? Even though they are way more prepared than me so there's no reason for that. Anyway, I know that this is so dumb but I've been fearing the day I have to tell them for months. AND WHAT IF I FAIL and then they all know I couldn't make it omg this keeps me up at night

Update: I have determined I am a dumb bitch. Thanks for all ur help

We need to talk about the insane workload of math students
I've noticed over the last couple quarters that the workload that UCLA math gives to its students is pretty extreme. I've only been taking 1-2 upper div math classes a quarter, but I've consistently noticed that I'm working at least 10-20 hours a week on homework, and the 24 hour exams that are "meant to take only 1 hour" take at least 12, sometimes longer. 

Am I the only person who thinks this is ridiculous?? I can't even imagine what full math majors must deal with (I'm only a minor). The workload takes a noticeable toll on my mental health on bad weeks. At least with Zoom University, 24 exams make getting a good grade a possibility. Can't imagine what it would be like to take these exams in the actual time frame professors would allow in person.

Also I guess curves aren't a thing, like who needed them anyway /s
