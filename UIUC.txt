Is there a legitimate reason as to why CS + X is not allowed to participate in Hoeft T&M?
Idk if I‚Äôm missing something but why aren‚Äôt we allowed to apply? We fall under the CS major and pay the engineering tuition as well. I get why we don‚Äôt get the 5 year BS/MS for CS, but I don‚Äôt get why we cannot apply for the technology and management minor.

Any easy 400lv CS courses that is purely theory based? I really enjoyed CS173, and I‚Äôm looking for similar courses that just teach you concepts, no coding, very low workload (173 no homework), easy exams. 

Or maybe I should just say any easy CS electives, just don‚Äôt really want to code, but need CS courses for my advanced computing electives

Illini Stranded in India
Funny story, I was home for the semester. Always planned on coming back to the US at the end of the semester for my internship. Had my ticket and everything booked as well.

I've been super excited about my internship, it can't arrive quick enough.

Suddenly the cases in India skyrocket, and flights get cancelled left, right and center. Then Biden restricts Indians entering the country from May 4 onwards. 

Biden did say that students resuming their semester in the Fall are exempt from the ban. 

But that's far away. Seems like I'm not gonna be able to board my flight in mid-May. 

My question is, for anyone who knows about the situation - is there any way in which I, an F1 student, can return to the US safely on my flight in mid-May?

Thanks in advance.

Anxious about RA Application
Still haven't heard back from the RA application administrators to notify me of my status (whether I was accepted or rejected or wait listed). They said they would notify applicants the week of April 26th and the week has gone by with still no email in sight. I'm really anxious because this RA position determines whether or not I get to study on campus next semester, and I still haven't heard anything. Has anyone else in this sub applied and have you received your notification? I'm curious but if its just them being slow I don't know.

If any Architecture majors/alumni specifically want to also contribute, I would really appreciate it.

Why does CS 233 have such weird time slots???
8:30-10:30 or 10:30-12:30 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Those are the only two (unless you get into the honors section). But why? One of these classes is extremely early while the other conflicts with a lot of other classes. **And, to top it all off, these time slots start and end at the half-hour mark, meaning that, despite taking only 2 hours, I now conflict with classes in 3 normal time slots.** I know they didn't have just two timeslots last semester. Why is it that they think that just because it isn't the pandemic that making such restrictive class times is suddenly a good idea? I'm genuinely pretty upset as now I'm being time-conflicted out of classes I wanted to take for fun unless I want to wake up before 8 AM to walk to this dumb class. I wouldn't be having this problem if they had more time slots or IF THEY JUST MADE THEIR TIME SLOTS START AND END AT THE HOUR LIKE A NORMAL CLASS. Sorry, I don't want to offend or annoy any teaching staff but this feels unfair and the system of registration this time around is making me want to tear my hair out.

Are there any restaurants near here that have vegan food that is pretending to not be vegan?
There are some good non-vegan restaurants around here, but comparably few vegan ones and they all seem to do food that's normally vegan (e.g. a lot of the Indian restaurants come up in a search for vegan restaurants). I'd rather have a restaurant that has vegan imitations of non-vegan things that are otherwise common, like vegan cheesecake, macaroni and cheese, cottage cheese, pancakes, butter, corn, etc. Is there anything like this around here? Something that's just like Cracker Barrel but where it's all vegan would be perfect. It's not too hard to cook most of this stuff at home, but I'd rather not have to whenever I want these things.

Classes for fall semester (sophomore in EE)
I am a rising sophomore in EE trying to plan my schedule for next fall.  So far I plan on taking ECE 220, PHYS 213, PHYS 214, and a Gen Ed, but this is only 12 credit hours.  Any suggestions on maybe one more class to take?  I have finished my math sequence, but I am not opposed to taking another math class as long as I find it interesting/not too difficult workload.  Or is it feasible to take ECE 210 at the same time?  Or maybe just knock out another Gen Ed?

Any input appreciated.  Also any professor recommendations :)

counts as cheating?
When do emails about academic integrity violations get sent out? I took a test yesterday using cbtf online. I wasn‚Äôt cheating and am willing to retake the test with tighter restrictions if needed.  

The proctor put me in a breakout room and asked to see my surroundings because I kept glancing at my phone/to my right (where phone was). 
This is because my phone is on top of several books and during a previous exam it fell down, and I didn‚Äôt notice for enough time that the proctor noticed. I was worried and kept glancing at it. 

After looking at my surroundings the proctor said I‚Äôm good and put me back in the regular room and I know the question sounds stupid but do you think I‚Äôll get in trouble? I‚Äôm very anxious about it but I‚Äôm willing to redo the test if needed.

Orgo Chem 232/233 vs Orgo Chem 236/237?
I'm currently signing up for classes for the coming fall semester, but I want to get a better idea about the differences between the two sequences from past students. I heard that I can take chem 232 with the lab section 237 but I don't know what the advantages and disadvantages to that are. Can anyone give some detailed perception about these classes (how hard they are, advice on how to study for them, etc.)? I should add that I'm also pretty concerned for my grade because I've had a pretty rough year this year, and I want to do the best I can in as hard of a class as I can be in as I will be applying to med-school. I'd appreciate any advice or knowledge!

Last minute decision UIUC Vs Purdue
Classic me needs help deciding the day before deadline on which school to head off to. I‚Äôm in state so U of I would be cheaper compared to Purdue and I would definitely pick U of I if I didn‚Äôt get sent to DGS. Purdue on the other hand, admitted me into FYE. I‚Äôm considering doing computer engineering, but I fear the amount of coursework and math might be a bit too much for me considering how I handle classes (a lot of procrastination that needs fixing). My struggle is if I don‚Äôt do engineering at purdue I‚Äôm paying more to do what I would be doing at U of I. All help is appreciated

Housing Contracts
Hey guys, finally committed last night for Comp E! I had a couple of questions regarding housing contracts though. What happens if we select housing after the priority housing date? Will we still be able to choose our roommates, type of dorm, or apply to llcs?

 I also have been put on the waitlist for a couple of other colleges. Some of those are closer to home and would be instate for me, so I would prefer those. If I do get admitted there, how much money would I be losing if I break a housing contract? Is it better for me to apply to housing after I get my waitlist decisions, or is it better for me to apply now so I can choose a roommate, and my dorm?

Pretty much as the title says - I'm looking for good studio apartments near the engineering quad, preferably below $1k per month. Right now I'm looking pretty closely at 502 E Healey with UGroup (they're $1k per month but they want 80 a month for utilities, which is really shit). 

Any suggestions/experiences?

Looking for a place that has a very good internet (fiber optic with 1Gb) (5/1 and 5/8)
Hello, I am a student in UIUC. I am currently living in Champaign.

The reason why I am looking for a place to use internet in Champaign or Urbana at May 1st (and May 8th) is because I need to participate in a game tournament which requires fast internet (and little ping) and my apartment does not provide stable fast internet.

I am just going to stay from 6pm to 11pm and will bring my desktop and monitor. The only condition I am looking for is the fiber internet (wired).

I am willing to negotiate for the payment.

Thank you.

Any tips for prospective CEE undergrad student applying next cycle?
UIUC is my dream school. I‚Äôm currently a junior at a magnet school in IL. I barely have any experience with engineering because I recently found out that I want to major in Civil/ Environmental Engineering. I am aware that UIUC is competitive for CS and engineering, so I have been worried about getting in. What should I focus on from now on until the time I apply (September bc EA and I want to apply super early for scholarships). How can I write an effective ‚ÄúWhy Major‚Äù essay?

My info for context:
Female/ Asian/ First-gen/ Low income/ undocumented immigrant/ ESL
GPA: 4.0/4.0 UW 4.98/4.0 W
SAT: 1440 (will retake in June and probably retake again in August after practicing consistently)
Course Rigor: All honors, few APs, take dual enrollment classes outside of school every semester
Essay Writing Skill: horrible but I will probably spend a lot of time on the why major essay and have free mentors read over them
EC: President/ Founder of an environmental related club, VP of a culture club, PR of a girl in STEM club, Math Team (never won major awards tho), volunteer at a religious institution since middle school, badminton, dance group, will do a research with a CEE professor(maybe? they ghosted me after saying they accepted me so idk ahsjsjjs), got accepted into Girls Who Code this summer
Awards: None

Thank you so much for your time, I really appreciate it! Cannot wait to apply soonüß°

Have an amazing day and happy friday!!

Please be careful driving and biking, and don't touch or interact with the babies. A lot of them are curious with humans because they're too young to be scared of you at the moment, but you can still give and get diseases from them.

Reality of Pre-engineering
College decisions are closing in and I am just making some final checks about my decision. I applied for Mech Eng as my first choice and undecided as my second, I got accepted to Pre-engineering and think that it is a great idea for me to explore the subject a bit more before I choose my focus. With that said, I have heard a lot of talk about it being barely possible to get into CS and ECE from pre eng without a 4.0gpa. So I would like to ask how challenging will it be for me to get into other engineering courses (such as Mech) since I do not think I'll be able to maintain a 4.0 for 2 years straight. Thanks!

Co-op program at UIUC
Hello

I am a prospective student for the MSE program. I am interested in doing co-ops in college. Is the UIUC co-op program good at UIUC? Do students typically have to find the co op? Is it just an option?

What‚Äôs a typical schedule like for a semester school?
Hi I‚Äôm an incoming sophomore transfer from the west coast and my current school‚Äôs in a quarter system right now. I haven‚Äôt had experience in semester schools for the past 3 years, so I basically forgot how things work in a semester system.

I‚Äôm trying to plan out a schedule for my major (math and cs) but I have no idea how many major classes + gen ed classes I should take in total, and how many credits students usually take (like how many is considered average or light or heavy etc).

What is the typical schedule people usually take? Like the number of major courses and gen eds?

Any insights would be appreciated, thank you.

AP Credits (Long)
I literally just accepted my offer of admission an hour ago, so I'm super excited.

This won't be an immediate thing that I need to take action for, but does anyone here have advice on AP credits? I will have taken 20+ AP/dual enrollment courses by the time I graduate (soon!), and have credit available for a lot of them. I've seen a lot of people talk about using the credits to save them from certain classes (I've looked at the policy and I definitely have some that would be accepted). *However*, I've been under the impression that it's better for me to not use the AP credits and just take the classes. The reasoning behind this is that college classes are very different from AP courses, so they'll help me transition to college. I was also told that if they do end up being easy, it'll both help me start off strong GPA-wise and settle in.

On the flip side of this, I've seen people on subreddits saying things along the line of "take the AP credit and run." Any thoughts or opinions on this? Thank you very much!

Math 231 in freshman year?
Hi! I am an incoming freshman for Fall 2021. I took the AP Calc AB test and got a 4 on it. On the AP credit website for UIUC, they say that if I get a 4 or 5, I get credit for Math 220. I haven't taken the ALEKS PPL yet. If I get below or above a 70%, will I still need to take Math 220? If I pass with over 70%, can I just skip Math 220 and put Math 231 into my schedule without talking to the couselor? Thank you!

India COVID aid resources and donations- fundraising
Hi everyone,

We have a huge Indian student community in UIUC. A lot of us might know someone from India who has family back there. I was wondering if we, the students, could all gather some links to resources and create a fundraiser to donate to foundations in India that are helping get basic aid to people in dire need.
The country is really struggling. Maybe we could all do a small little part as help sitting from here. I totally understand feeling anxious and helpless, so maybe if there's something that we can do to help people, I'd be willing to come forward.
Any suggestions for fund raising or crowd sourcing are open. Also, if there's a way to make it an official thing that goes through the university's name, I'd be happy to explore that idea as well. Let's all come together for a good cause as a university!

How badly did I mess up (apartments)
I signed with a leasing company (the Hub on Cmapus) early on. They got me to sign with them because they said their rates wouldn't lower however they lied. I'm paying more than residents who sign with the now, plus they get a $1000 gift card. 

The rates are now about $100 cheaper than before, they said it was temporary however that was months ago. When I called to ask them about it, they kind of laughed and said NOPE you ready signed 

I can't even back our of my contract with out paying $500

Can anyone give some insight as to how much would be reasonable to propose? This is my first time doing research. Much appreciated!

How do seats get taken up so fast?
My time ticket was today and literally the only class that I wanted and was able to get was a freaking gen Ed class. 

One of the classes I wanted, MATH 412, is restricted to my major. And I‚Äôm a junior by credit hours. And it‚Äôs still already full. How? I‚Äôm pretty sure that it‚Äôs not even a popular class.

And I couldn‚Äôt sign up for CS 225 since they‚Äôre still trying to figure out how to do their lab sections.

And the other classes I wanted don‚Äôt even open to general campus until May 10.

Idk if this is just me but I feel like not being a James Scholar screws over a lot of people, and the classes with priority for certain majors are borderline impossible to get for other majors

So spread the word about the CamFac!!!

ECE 391 w/ 374

Also I‚Äôve heard 374 isn‚Äôt nearly as much work as 391 for example but is just extremely mentally challenging. Does this sound feasible if I want to maintain some glimmer of life outside school?

Looking for Accommodation
Hope everyone is doing well and staying safe. 

I am an incoming international MS engineering student and looking for a place to stay starting fall 21. These three factors are of the most significance for me (in order of importance):-

1) Pricing (the cheaper, the better)
2) Distance from the campus (the closer, the better)
3) Number of roommates (the lesser, the better)

It would be very helpful if anyone could suggest a housing option that I should look into or someone I should get in touch with (even a dependable website would be great). An estimate of how much does housing in general cost at UIUC would also be something I can use.

Thanking you in anticipation. Cheers!

Thoughts on what the end of the pandemic means
I'm wondering what you all think the "end of the pandemic" means or looks like. I think for a long time I thought that the moment I got fully vaccinated I could start doing pretty much whatever I want without worry. Now that I am fully vaccinated, I still legally have to wear masks in stores and make sure I don't gather with more than 10 people in campus town and get tested twice a week. Even besides the legal limitations, I find myself and my friends hesitant to go to a restaurant or a bar. And I'm certainly not against those precautions. Around 45% of the US population has had at least one shot and around 30% of the US is fully vaccinated. Yet our case numbers (in the US) are around double what they were last year around this time. I'm just wondering what you think will cause a return to normal (ie. no mask mandates, no gathering limits, bars & restaurants at full capacity).  Also, when do you think on an individual basis, people could start doing pre-pandemic things. Consistently low numbers of cases? Vaccination levels at a certain percent? Other factors? I think herd immunity via vaccination requires us to have around 70% of people fully vaccinated but I'm not entirely convinced we'll ever get there.
Edit: To clarify, I'm mostly asking when you think governments and social acceptance will make moves back toward normalcy, not when they should.

Creepy experience at Illini Eyecare on Green
This happened to me two years ago and I didn't tell anybody but a few close friends because it was relatively minor, but it has stuck in my memory and I wanted to see if anybody else has had a similar experience. I went to Illini Eyecare on a weekday looking to get one of the lenses on my glasses replaced after I accidentally put them through the wash (I know) and gotten it scratched. After giving them my information at the front desk, they led me to the back where my eyes were tested. After that, I went into a further back room with a male optometrist, and he closed the door behind us. I sat in the chair in front of that lens testing device? The one where they lower it in front of your eyes and test your ability to see letters from afar. The male optometrist sat directly in front of me as he examined my eyes through the device thing, and he sort of closed his legs around mine. His legs were tightly pressed against my thigh, kind of locking me in. I immediately got a sense that something was wrong and my brain entered a sort of fight or flight, and I tensed up and started looking towards the door. When he finished the examination I just got up and left and didn't say anything. It was one of those situations that you never expect to be in, and when you are, your mind just goes blank and waits for it to be over. I know that this isn't the craziest and most violent story, but it was wildly inappropriate and should not have happened to me. I wanted to share it to see if anybody else has had a sketchy experience at this place, and maybe warn people about it. Thank you for listening.

If you had a wonderful post-graduation job lined up and you could graduate one semester early, would you do it?
Or would you decide to stay at UIUC the full four years to get the most out of being here? Which would you pick? Also why?

Lost (?) cat seen near downtown Urbana
Tuxedo cat (black with white underbelly) last seen at 6pm today (28 April) at the northwest corner of Race and Illinois, in the yard of the All Souls Presbyterian Church.  I tried to get a picture but it ran into the bushes.  No collar or tags seen.

Hopefully someone recognizes the description and location.  Let‚Äôs help this cat get home!

Covid Second Wave in India
Just wanted to share my frustration and helplessness.

You might might know of the second covid wave in India. Calling it a wave is being euphemistic and the official data is only a fraction of the actual cases and casualties. A country with already a dilapidated health infrastructure, this wave has caught the nation totally unprepared.

It just feels so helpless being thousands of miles away from home.

Edit 1: I wake up with with frantic messages on WhatsApp groups asking for any leads on Oxygen,  available hospital beds, available testing sites and life-saving drugs. Its a horrible feeling of not being able to help.

Fall 2021 Schedule Thoughts?
Hello all. So I think I got my schedule pretty much figured out, and I just wanted to know if this is too much of a workload or if it's okay? I'm in LAS leaning towards IB as my major and I'll be living on campus this fall.

IB 203 (4) and 204 (4) 

CHEM 104 (3) and 105 (1)

FR 103 (4)

Personally I think I can handle another round of French, and I heard that CHEM 104 is significantly easier than 102. I'm not sure about both IB classes though. Thanks.

Best pair from ECE 310, 329, 330, 340, 342+343?
So I'm planning to do an ECE Minor and I have to choose any two of the classes in the title to fulfill the advanced electives requirement. I'm probably not gonna subject myself to ECE 385/391 unless they magically have less workload than these classes, which I highly doubt from what I've seen. Can anyone give me some insight as to which pair of classes above would be the least stressful? Thanks!

Math 427 - What to expect?
As titled. Pretty nervous about it, all I know is the grading is not historically the harshest, which is nice. If anyone has any advice for preparation over the summer, that would be awesome, as my plan right now is to review my linear algebra and maybe pick up Dummit & Foote. Thanks.

I want to take this class's 4 credit hour version, the graduate student one,  I am an undergraduate and I was wondering if any grad students or undergrads that have taken this class or similar ones have know what the extra project is like or what I should expect.

Need course advice!!!
I need to take phys102 while studying for the MCAT and don't know where to fit it in. Would it be manageable with chem104/105 and IB150/151? Or, would it be better to take it with MCB450 (biochemistry)? I still have chem104/105, ib150/151, phys102, mcb450, and mcb402 I want to take and only 2 semesters to take them in. Any advice would be amazing!

ECE cannot register for CS courses
Just realized CompE has the same time ticket as all the other general engineering. This really starts to make me question why I am in CompE... We do need CS courses to fulfill advanced computing electives for graduation. I believe all the sections would be filled before then, how did people manage to get the CS courses they want? Like CS 411

Questions from a Prospective Illini
Hi! UIUC is one of my top choices but I have some urgent last-minute questions and I would really appreciate if someone could answer.

1. Would it be possible for me to get a single room as a freshman? I would be willing to pay a lot extra. I would be okay with living off-campus too. This is a dealbreaker for me.
2. What is the political culture like? Is it far left or moderate left? Will it be hard for me to fit in as a moderate liberal or would I be criticized a lot for not being far liberal?
3. How are the mental health services? Do your parents find out if you use them?
4. Should I bring a car to campus? Is the public transportation good?
5. Do the large class sizes detract from your experience?
6. Do you feel safe on campus? Especially if you're a woman?

I also have some questions specific to the CS program:

1. In general, is the program more theoretical or practical? Does it prepare you well for going straight to industry after graduation?
2. Is there grade deflation?
3. Is the student culture collaborative or competitive?
4. Do AP credits transfer over well for CS students or are they useless?
5. How hard is it to get into CS clubs? Are they super competitive?
6. How is the workload? Would it be difficult to adjust to for someone who took 12 APs and the full IB program in high school?

Also, this question is a bit different, but do you think I should go to UCLA or UIUC for Computer Science + Linguistics? They are my top contenders because they both offer that combined major. I personally like UCLA a lot because of the location, weather, campus, etc. but I know that UIUC has a better CS program. I did compare the salaries for CS grads from both schools using Payscale data and UCLA's was higher but I'm pretty sure that's just because the cost of living is much higher in CA. Would it be worth it for me to choose UIUC since it has the better CS program? Both colleges would cost about the same for me.

Edit: why is this getting downvoted? If I said something offensive just let me know and I'll fix it. Also sorry if this is the wrong place to ask, I didn't see any megathreads for prospective students to comment on so I made a post.

Looking for a place to stay(for half a day) at May 1st and May 8th in Champaign or Urbana
Hello, I am a student in UIUC. I am currently living in Champaign.

The reason why I am looking for a place to stay in Champaign or Urbana at May 1st (and May 8th) is because I need to participate in a game tournament which requires fast internet (and little ping) and my apartment does not provide stable fast internet.

I am not going to sleep or do anything other than playing game.  I am just going to stay from 6pm to 11pm and will bring my desktop and monitor. The only condition I am looking for is the fiber internet (wired).

I am willing to pay at least the same amount of price that I see on airbnb and I am willing to talk and meet beforehand for the safety issues!

Conflicted Student with admissions decisions.
Hello there everyone, I am a senior at a school in Joliet. I got admitted into UIUC about 2 months ago and was admitted for Political Science. I was convinced that this was the school for me, but I later received an acceptance letter from the George Washington University. I was accepted there for International Relations, which I know is not a major at UIUC, but is basically like political science. To be honest, I don't really care about the degree since my main goal is to be an exemplary student able to ace the LSAT and head to law school with an outstanding GPA from any university with a great name to it. 

My first question is, What is the average GPA for someone in LAS?

My second question is, What are some benefits to the Political Science program at UIUC compared to going to George Washington University. 

My third question, They say that the classes are huge at UIUC, am I able to talk to the professor for some questions, or do I have to work independently. 

I know this post is very direct, but as you know, I must make a decision soon, so I am quite nervous about which path to take. I hope someone in the same position answers this, but honestly, anyone in LAS can help me out here. Thank you for your time in reading my concerns.

About Gies

Testing every other day (a rant)
I just got an email saying that I need to test every other day effective immediately. Since my last test was over the weekend, I no longer have building access. I was supposed to give an in-person presentation this afternoon and now I need to reschedule it.

I'm just venting; I'm fully vaccinated and the chances of me having COVID are ridiculously low. Why couldn't they have given me a heads up or a grace period instead of taking away my building access with no warning?

UIUC vs UIC Bioengineering/PreMed
Hello! I got into Bioengineering in both UIUC and Uic and plan on doing pre-med. I know UIUC has a more advanced engineering department. However, UIC I have guaranteed admission to med school (still take MCAT), but I do not know completely if I want to fully commit to medicine also considering I would remain at UIC if I do not end up doing med school. Anyone have any advice or opinion on which school? Specifically, the \*bioengineering opportunities\*, campus feel, and quality of school's preparation for med school/med school applications, etc. I am also considering the campus environment because I would like some comfort in how busy I will be. UIC would also be the cheaper of the two. Thanks!

ECE 581 - how important is ECE 310 as a prerequisite for this course?

Has anyone taken Phy 142 at Parkland over the summer?--- Phys 212 Equivalent
The instructor is Professor Omar Adawi. I heard he is very rigorous and challenging. If anyone has taken this before at Parkland with him can you give me some realistic insight on how hard this class actually is? Any tips on how to succeed in this class would also be of much help.

I already know I have to take both 142 and 143 at parkland for it to transfer to  PHYS 212, 213, and 214. 

Also, if anyone else is planning on taking this over the summer at Parkland we can make a study group if you want. 

Thanks in advance.

Looking for an authentic DGS story
I'm still considering committing to UIUC, but I think I need to hear some more real stories about how the program actually is. Applied to Gies (Business Unassigned), got rejected, accepted second-choice DGS. If I enroll at UIUC in DGS, I'm thinking of trying to apply to Gies or LAS for Public Policy and Law/Political Science.

&#x200B;

So, can anyone who was/is in DGS share their experience here? Please do not reply if you tried to transfer to Grainger from DGS (I've already heard all of those). Also, please try to be objective as possible (If you tried to transfer to Gies or something, but had a low GPA and got rejected, please don't blame DGS).

SINGLE ROOM DORM ADVICE
Hey, so i am an incoming freshmen at uiuc (compE) and am very clueless on the whole dorm situation.
I was initially thinking of having a single room but after reading up about the dorms i saw that there are very few of them. Right now i am confused on whether i should find a roommate or still have hopes on getting a single room.
Does anyone know what are the changes of getting a single room is and if so in which hall ? Also should i find a roommate just in case or have the uni choose one for me if i have to share the room?
Sorry if this whole thing sounds confusing.

This morning at 9 am, a man was poking around our yard. He pressed his face against the windows and was looking around, and tried to get inside but our door was locked. 

Anyone else experience something like this?

His description was 5‚Äù8‚Äô, black, looked to be about 50, average build, and had a hunch, buzzed hair that was slightly receding, and short facial hair.

Reconsidering UIUC
I was accepted to UIUC for fall of 2021. I applied for CS, but was only given admission into my second choice major (Statistics). I am not thrilled to be in Statistics. I also understand the difficulty of switching to CS. I would also be almost stuck in Grainger College of Engineering, I have always been math oriented but am not sure if I want to do engineering. Is it worth it to try to switch into CS and risk the possibility of having to pick up an engineering major?

ALSO 

Is it more likely that I could get into a CS major through CS+ X majors that are already in LAS rather than "Straight CS"? I am not incredibly interested in any of the choices but they are also not all repulsive choices of a major to me. I would prefer a CS + mathematics or CS +statistics major.  

I'm considering another school that is a lower ranking but I think it would be easier to switch into my preferred major. Do you think UIUC is a worthy risk for me to take?

ECE 422 just went online lectures - are ECE/CS kids getting baited into signing leases for Fall 21?
Is this something I can expect for other classes? They said that it's a large lecture so it is hard to accommodate. My other classes in CS are larger.

Not trying to complain, I get that it is a pandemic but I was really looking forward to in person instruction. I missed probably 80% of asynchronous lectures this semester and made it to 100% of synchronous lectures. Zoom University has been an awful experience but at least I did not have to pay Champaign rent.

For transfer students literally not a single foot on campus all year and no real friends made in-person, please don't tell me to make friends on Discord or social media, it's not the same.

Also, it looks like we still have to do COVID tests even if we are fully vaccinated? Why??

Lastly, please don't screw us on Thanksgiving break. No Spring break was one of the worst things that could have happened, most other universities did not do this. Couldn't they have just done these repeated, invasive tests 3-4 times the week of Spring break and given us Spring break if they were so paranoid that god forbid, students actually get a break and hit the beach/go on a hike/watch movies/travel?

Flairing this as a shitpost because it started off constructive about ECE 422/CS 461 and became a long whine. But seriously, I thought we pick locks in CS 461 and do more hands on stuff.

ECE and CS students are human beings too. Spending 99% of our time in front of a screen (for all classes, mundane assignments done pretty much entirely alone, social media/Discord to have some semblance of human interaction) for 1.5 years is not healthy.

I wore a mask every day when outside and never went out and social distanced very carefully.

If this policy is instituted I'm watching all CS 461 lectures at KAMS with mask off. So done.

edit: is it guaranteed our classes will be in person then for cs/ece if we register for in person sections?

I need one more course for the graduate minor in statistics, and I'll be honest - I do not have a very strong math background (haven't formally taken calculus/linear algebra, but have survived thus far). I need to get at least a C- in this course for it to count towards the minor.  


Does anyone have experience in this course? Specifically, would someone be willing to send me the syllabus (dm me plz) and talk about the mathematical rigor of the course (i.e. are there exams where you do math with a time limit?) I am very comfortable with programming in R, so I'm not worried about that - I'm mostly concerned with needing to know 20 formulas offhand that I've never seen before. Any advice would be great!

Recently renewed lease, then got a job in another state. What options do I have for requesting a lease to be terminated?
I was told that I can be let out of a lease if I get a job in another state. I wanted to follow up on this but am not sure where to look.

I work in a research lab on campus and they hired me to conduct fieldwork in another state for the summer. Problem is, I renewed my lease earlier this year (it would have expired in July). They are paying me enough to support myself, part of which will need to go to housing, but I can't pay for 2 apartments. My plan is to (hopefully) be let out of my lease, then move into a place when I get back. I have lived in my apartment for almost 8 years and am willing to move to another one of the property manager's properties. Any advice?

What kind of people stay here over the summer?
I'm really hoping to make more friends this summer (I don't have much now at all) but I'm worried if I stay in Champaign over the summer my social life will die. Does anyone have any advice?

I'm from the suburbs and it's hard to make friends there too.

Guy scoping out houses in urbana? Anyone else?

This morning at 9 am, a man was poking around our yard. He pressed his face against the windows and was looking around, and tried to get inside but our door was locked. 

Anyone else experience something like this?

His description was 5‚Äù8‚Äô, black, looked to be about 50, average build, and had a hunch, buzzed hair that was slightly receding, and short facial hair.

Math 415- midterm 2 grade reduced by like 7% one month after exam due to curve grading error found after midterm 3
My grade wasn't actually reduced but i read that peoples grade was reduced by like 6 or 7% for some people on their midterm 2 grade a month after it came out and after midterm 3 since the grading error was figured out when exam 3 grades came out. That's kind of a lot and could have affected how they studied. Is there anything we can do about it to fix it or like just do something about it?

Should I get an IPad
Recently after this semester I realized I‚Äôm sucking at school. All I would do is lay in my bed, and would wait until the very last minute to do my homework. Then it was dark, and I‚Äôd struggle to write my notes on the paper, or take notes quickly, or understand what I‚Äôm writing or just really grasp the concept. So I‚Äôm looking to trying new things and trying to get my concentration back with school and I think an iPad will help me at least with the better note taking and concentration more and taking notes in the dark. If anyone has an iPad do you think it‚Äôs a good investment to get. Also I‚Äôm stuck between the 12.9 inch iPad Pro or the 11 inch and which one if you have an iPad would you think is better for portability and good note taking compared to taking it on regular piece of paper.

Kinesiology: UIC vs UIUC
Hello UIUC,

I am a current freshman kinesiology student at UIC. I was accepted into UIUC earlier this month and wanted to know if it was worth it to transfer for this program. I am already pretty established here as I am part of the honors college and track team at UIC. Is it worth it to give those up to be a general kinesiology student at UIUC. Any advice would be greatly appreciated,

Thank you!

ECE 462 vs 395
I‚Äôm finishing 385 and feel like I didn‚Äôt learn as much as I should‚Äôve with it being online and the insane deadlines each week. I want to solidify my knowledge a little more w digital systems and am deciding between these 2 classes. 

For 462 (logic synthesis): I‚Äôm just wondering, how useful is the material, especially in industry? Also I‚Äôve heard this isn‚Äôt too time consuming of a class, is that true?

For 395 (Digital Projects Lab): How does this lab go? I want to take this because I feel like my design skills aren‚Äôt that good. How much guidance/help can you get during the semester for ur project? How much time per week did you spend building it?

If anyone‚Äôs taken either and could share their experience it‚Äôd be very helpful. Thanks!

Saw a car hit a cat near Ashton Woods
Hey all, I was on a walk in the research park area of campus near Ashton woods and saw a cat run out in front of a car and get hit. The cat ran off in between the AGCO building and the pond next to it. It was possibly a brown tabby cat with white paws- it was hard to see from where I was. I tried looking for it with a flashlight but no luck :( I hope it‚Äôs ok and if you‚Äôve lost a cat I hope you find them!

Need Help Deciding: UIUC vs UBC CS (international student)
Hey! So, I have less than a week 'til I have to commit to a university, and right now my top choices are between UIUC and UBC (vancouver, canada) for CS. I totally get that I'll get biased responses posting here, but I'd love to hear your inputs anyway. 

As an international student, I'm pretty worried about the job and internship opportunities available in the US, since, compared to Canada, getting a working visa -- if that's an option I'd like to to take in the future -- seems to be more difficult. 

UIUC's tuition is higher by around 5k/year, but its CS program seems to be regarded as better than UBC's. I'd also have to declare CS *after* my first year at UBC, and that means averaging around 80% across the courses I'd take in the Faculty of Science (there *is* a small chance I wouldn't be able to declare the major). Meanwhile, I was directly admitted to CS at UIUC. Also, UIUC's campus culture seems to be a lot more vibrant than UBC's, but UBC's location in Vancouver is nicer to live in. 

To all of you: How would you compare the tech industry between US and Canada? How would the opportunities differ for CS (international) students? How do you think the experience (in college and after) would differ overall? 

If you know UBC, how do you think the CS program compares to UIUC's?

What do you think in general about choosing between these two universities, given my circumstances?

If there are any international students reading this, was it difficult for you to get internships, and are/were you afraid you wouldn't be able to get a job or (if you wanted to) extend your OPT/CPT? 

Also! I don't know if this matters all that much, but the US doesn't seem like a very safe place for Asian women right now (and I am one). Is safety ever a particularly prominent issue here? And lastly, do you feel like international students integrate well into the community at UIUC? I've heard international students could sometimes isolate and group themselves together at other universities, and I'm just curious if that happens here. (I wouldn't want to do that.)

your average pitch to help out a fall 2021 freshie!
hi everyone! I was admitted to uiuc and plan on attending fall 2021! I hope to major in biology specifically (molecular and cellular biology) while on the pre-med track! I was admitted to the honors college as well! hoping some upperclassmen can drop some advice and/or answer any questions below :))

1.) Any general advice for incoming freshies/mcb majors/ or pre-meds?

2.) Where are the best dorms or where do you recommend dorming? Are any more favorable for science classes proximity wise?

3.) How is the grading system/scale at uiuc (if any mcb majors or pre-meds have opinions)? Any professor recommendations? 

4.) How is the availability of research opportunities, clinical opportunities, leadership, and much more?

5.) Are clubs selective or can anyone join?

6.) Would you chose uiuc if you could again based on what you know now?

7.) Is anyone familiar with phi delta epsilon and how hard it is to join this pre-med fraternity?

thank you so so much for your time even if you just read this! so excited to be joining everyone this fall!!

CS 446 w/ Koyejo
I'm interested in taking this course since from what I've read and heard it seems to provide a pretty in depth insight into ML. However I've also read a lot of bad things about this course, about how it's organized, the workload, exams, etc. I will be taking 391 next semester so I think that would just make everything 10x worse if this is true. Can anyone who was recently in this class or had this professor tell me if this is doable without wanting to kms?

Room Configuration for University Housing
Hi guys, I‚Äôm an incoming freshman who‚Äôs applying for university housing with ISR my first choice followed by FAR/PAR. I‚Äôm looking at the dorm pictures and I see them being set up in various ways and was wondering if we would be allowed to configure in our own way?

 I know it says "Due to COVID-19, Bed Configuration Requests are suspended until further notice‚Äù but I was wondering if anyone knew whether this will change for the 2021-2022 year.

How much freedom we would have if we were to be allowed this year and how does the whole process work? If we aren‚Äôt allowed to configure, what is the standard dorm room that we would be given from the pictures provided?

Hello all, I am moving to Champaign in August and have a pretty dog-reactive pup.

Questions about Fall Move-In
It might be a bit too early to ask this, but I'm an incoming out-of-state grad student and I was wondering when would be a good day to move in during the fall. I know classes start Aug 23rd but I'm assuming there will be some orientation activities happening a little earlier. I was thinking of coming a week early (\~ Aug 15) but I'm not sure if that would be too early.

Also, I've recently signed a lease for an apartment where I have my own bedroom and bathroom, but my entire family (parents + sibling) are planning to come drop me off. This might be kind of a stupid question, but do people usually stay in a hotel when their families are coming to drop them off? Or in the apartment?

How helpful is Innovation LLC at ISR for freshmen?

--------------------------------------------------
I created a large student survey last summer (450 redditors participated) and am back with survey #2
If you check my post history you'll see that I circulated a student survey last summer across various college subreddits. About 450 students participated, and the survey data was written up in a [Medium Piece](https://medium.com/@liviamorris/i-feel-that-the-future-ive-been-working-towards-my-whole-life-is-gone-now-what-students-have-b33e5d09456b?source=friends_link&sk=ef9ef45585d8c9c8aff6eaa007cd09d3).

Now that we've been in the pandemic for over a year, I'd love to get your guys' feedback once again. The first survey was largely about the difficulties of adjusting to the pandemic, while this one is focused more on how the pandemic has impacted mental health and mentorship, as well as whether you feel that your campus is supportive of students who want to pursue independent projects (e.g. startups, creative endeavors, on-campus initiatives, etc.). All responses are anonymous (no personal info is collected) and you can opt whether to have your responses included in the write-up. 

If anyone has questions, please feel free to ask. And if anyone wants a copy of the raw data when it's ready, PM me and I'll add your name to the list. 

Thanks so much - and good luck with midterms/finals!

Any communication about changes to testing policy and/or building access for vaccinated individuals?
Doesn't it make sense to get tested less often or allow building access to vaccinated individuals? It can't be hard to get verified as being vaccinated, especially if you got the vaccine at CRCE. We all get a card regardless.

transferring between cs+x?
incoming cs+econ freshman here. hoping to do fintech but after browsing around and doing more research i'm starting to see that while cs+econ could be useful, recruiters usually look for the solid math knowledge and cs+stat or cs+math may be a better fit. i looked online for the major switching policies, but it didn't give any info for students transferring from one cs+x to the other. would i still have to submit a portfolio and everything or is there an easier process to switch between different cs+x majors?

As an international student, how hard is it for international undergraduate students to get into LAS and even Psychology in particular?
I got accepted at UIUC in the college of LAS. How competitive is LAS and even Psychology for international UG applicants in particular? Should I be proud of myself for getting in or is it something anyone can do? Is Psychology at UIUC worth all of the money and effort?

Class Marketing Survey
Hey guys,

I'm working on a classroom project and would really appreciate it if you could take a quick survey. It'll only take five minutes of your time.

Thank you and have a great day!

How to Defer
I am about to commit to UIUC but I want to know how I can defer their acceptance. I've looked online and I haven't heard back from admissions yet and I'd like to get an answer because I have a 6-month internship lined up that I'd like to take during my deferrment.

UIUC CompE vs USC CECS
Hey guys,

So I have been admitted to both these programs and I am finding it really difficult to choose. I'm an international student so UIUC costs around 60k and USC around 80k. Costs are not an issue since my parents are willing to pay. 

Many people told me that for Engineering, UIUC is better but overall as a school, USC tends to rank higher. Additionally, the weather and location of USC are better. The main factor for me is academics and career opportunities so the other factors honestly do not matter. As the ECE department at UIUC is great, I was slightly leaning towards it but I am not sure. 

If anyone has opinions or thoughts on this please let me know! Thank you!

CS 412 w/Banerjee
Thinking about taking CS 412 with Professor Arindam Banerjee, what is the class like this semester workload wise?

homework graded for points....
homework is stressful enough as it is. why make it be graded for points too now? i personally found it easier to learn and be interested in the hw when it‚Äôs not graded for points because i‚Äôm not stressed out about getting something wrong. this is just my opinion tho lmk what y‚Äôall think

IB vs MCB
I just want a general biology degree but can't afford any other university of this quality. Idk whether to choose MCB or IB... Please help

I might be premed, not sure yet. I might be interested in physical therapy school, physicians assistant, or something similar, I find health a very interesting concept

I'm also interested in ecology and working with animals, wildlife biologist, marine biologist, zoologist... Possibly even research or becoming a professor. 

I love biology and I want to learn a lot about it, in depth. I find the MCB advanced classes a bit more interesting, like metabolic diseases, stem cell stuff, bio security. I also find some upper level ib interesting, marine bio, evolution of infectious diseases, animal behavior...

I want to have free time, a good GPA, I don't want it to be all memorizing, and I don't want it to be so specific as MCB is. That said, ib seems to be almost ALL ecology and similar stuff, and also I'm interested in health and the micro side. I have also heard that the IB core classes don't teach much past introductory stuff. I want to learn a lot about biology basically. I'm currently leaning towards IB but something's telling me to switch...
 
Is there anyway around having to choose? I'm not interested in the honors program, a bit too much math. What are your guys experiences in MCB and IB? And also, do you learn more in either? I skipped out of the 150s, ik that was dumb but I can't change it now.

I'm confused.

NPRE 402 or 201 for Tech Elective?

Places for extended periods of study for non-students?
Hello. My girlfriend is going to be visiting me this week and she has a lot of work she wants to get done in a quiet space and my apartment is unreliable for that :/.

She has a car so she doesn't have to keep it to the campus.

Student looking for story source

Hello everyone

I am a student writing about the rise of eating disorders in the pandemic and how it may be harder to access support. The study I am writing about shows how the pandemic has worsened or caused an eating disorder for some, and I have seen a lot of talk about this on social media. 

I understand this can be a really hard topic to talk about. In order to make this as safe as possible, I have gone over my questions with a nutritionist that specializes in eating disorders. 

If you recovering, recovered, or had any experience with an eating disorder, and you are comfortable sharing your story with only me and my professor, please message me and we can set something up.

I hate depression
Just venting. I set out with a simple set of goals today yet didn't get anything done. I've had depression episodes before, throughout the whole semester, but this one is a serious stinker. 

I didn't touch my Xbox at all this weekend, just did busy work and listened to music in the background. I feel terrible. Whenever I try reach out I always feel I come off as a drama queen or that I'm just being dramatic. I'm not allowed to feel this way cause there are people in worse positions than me. I literally delete every post I make after a few hours cause they make me cringe, yet it's how I feel that makes me make them to begin with.

I don't know anymore honestly. It's only gonna get worse realistically speaking. What do I know.

How hard is it for cs+x students to get into popular cs 400 level courses?
It seems pure(?) cs majors get higher priority when registering for cs 400 level courses. Do cs+x students have a hard time getting into extremely popular courses like ML taught by famous professors or do they eventually get in?

Also, will I have a hard time getting into certain undergrad research positions as a cs+linguisitcs major? I am interested in participating in ML/CV/NLP research as an undergrad while I am in UIUC.

Is there anyone who came to UIUC through "pathways to Illinois" from a community college?
Hello, I am an international student, and I am interested in studying computer science/cs + econ/cs+linguistics at UIUC. Is there anyone who came to UIUC through "pathways to Illinois"?([https://admissions.illinois.edu/apply/pathways](https://admissions.illinois.edu/apply/pathways))

Does UIUC accept computer science/cs + econ/cs+linguistics majors from "pathways to Illinois"? Also, is the admission guaranteed if I satisfy the requirements, or do I have to go through a competitive and holistic review by admission committees where I have to send essays and proofs of extracurricular activities?

I have dropped out from California community college this semester and have 7 W's on my transcript....(I had to take classes from 2:00am to 7:00am, 5 days per week, and couldn't take it any longer...) Would this jeopardize the transfer process?

Thank you for reading the post!

How‚Äôs this schedule for first semester Freshman year?
ECE student who thought skipping AP Chem and leaving it for college was a good idea.

ECE 120, PHYS 212, MATH 241, and a Gened while taking Chem 141 at Parkland (Chem 102/3 equivalent) during the same semester. It's 19 credit hours total which seems like a lot so I wanted to know how doable it is.

Fall 2021 Online Synchronous Classes
Edit: Actually, I didn't realize I could avoid this by changing my schedule slightly. I'll leave this post up in case anyone has any advice for people with the same issue. 

Can some help put this into perspective for me? If I have an in-person class immediately followed by an online synchronous class, what am I supposed to do? It's about a 20 minute walk back to my apartment and I have another in-person class afterwards as well. Am I just supposed to try and find a quiet place somewhere (ie. one of the libraries) and watch the lecture on my laptop? I assume some people have been doing this during this semester, but I feel like it will be even more common next semester. My personal opinion is that online synchronous classes really do not work well with in-person classes, but I doubt the university would ever get rid of them.

PSA: Anesthesiologist Assistant Career Pathway (Alternative Medical Career)
Hey yall, I'm a 2020 UIUC alum soon to matriculate into my anesthesiologist assistant (AA) graduate professional program and I just wanted to introduce people here to the AA career. It is very similar to the physician assistant pathway except it's completely specialized in anesthesia. Without any further ado:

In the 1960s‚Äîconcerned with the shortage of anesthesiologists throughout the United States ‚Äîa group of academic anesthesiologists came together to outline the role of a new mid-level anesthesia provider. This provider‚Äîthe Anesthesiologist Assistant (AA)‚Äîwas designed to alleviate a portion of the direct care burden facing perioperative physicians while, importantly, always remaining under the supervision of the anesthesiologist. This model of care is now called the Anesthesia Care Team (ACT) Model‚Äîoften deploying four mid-level anesthetists under the direction of one supervising anesthesiologist.

Although CAAs practice as physician extenders, similar to the PAs of other specialties, anesthesiologists chose to establish the AA profession with a distinct education and certification track‚Äîone focused solely on the unique demands of anesthesia practice.

In 1969, Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, OH) and Emory University (Atlanta, GA) accepted their first cohorts into Master of Science in Anesthesia and Master of Medical Science in Anesthesia programs. After decades of producing competent and caring providers, these programs were joined by South University (Savannah, GA) in 2004.

Since then, the AA profession has picked up some serious steam! Applicants will be accepted into thirteen programs across the country, with more programs in development. At the bare minimum, every AA applicant has: a premedical background paired with a bachelor‚Äôs degree, anesthesia shadowing experience in the operating room, and a competitive score on the MCAT or GRE.

Upon graduating from an intense 24-28 month masters‚Äô curricula, new AAs can expect to earn between $140-180K. Then, with experience, salaries can rise to >$220K before overtime pay. AAs work in a wide variety of practice settings, with responsibilities and schedules identical to any CRNAs within the same practice.

Despite the excellent clinical record of AAs‚Äîand the rising number of patients that thrive under the Anesthesia Care Team Model‚Äîanesthesia assistants are not yet able to practice in all 50 states due to their independent licensure requirements. State governments are gradually realizing the positive impact that fully-licensed CAAs can have on the lives of their physicians, healthcare systems, and‚Äîof course‚Äîpatients. 

If you guys have any questions, feel free to post them in the comments. I also highly recommend joining the CAA discord for any questions. We have a fairly robust FAQ and you can converse with pre-AAs, Student AAs, practicing CAAs, or even some undecided folk or the rare occasional physician. [CAA Discord](https://discord.gg/3q7rFgWj)

Information Science - UX
School of Information

I am a rising freshman in college, and I got into UIUC, UMD, and UMich. I want to major in Information Science, and focus in on UX Design. I am still trying to choose and I have a week left. UIUC is the has a major that focuses specifically on UX, but I have heard a lot of negative things about the campus. I live in North Carolina too, so it‚Äôs pretty far. However it is not as expensive as UMich and it‚Äôs supposed to be really good for Information Science. So I was wondering if anyone had any input on this, how bad the campus really is, etc. I‚Äôve also been told that it depends on the major, apparently CS majors have a really tough time? I also wanted to know how much practical on-the-job skills are taught in the UX concentration. If anyone knows about the path to a career in Product Design / UX Design from UIUC, please let me know if we can talk! Thanks :)

STAT 425 SU21 and FA21 differences?
Hope everyone is enjoying the weekend :).

I am planning to take STAT 425 this summer, but I noticed that the title for STAT 425 this summer is Applied Regression and Design. However, it is called Statistical Modeling I in the fall. I am wondering will there be any material difference between taking it this summer and fall? 

I know that the STAT department did some curriculum changes regarding STAT 420, 425, and 426. Will this update be effective starting this fall? In other words, is the material taught in 425 still the old material this summer but it will be the new/updated material this fall? Or the material will be updated this summer and it‚Äôs just the department did not change the title?

Any comments?

Fighting With My Parents About Research
Hey guys, I'm in a bit of a standoff with my parents over this AI research program I just got accepted into and would appreciate some other perspectives on the matter.

I'm a CS major, I have good internship experience already (will be interning at a fairly well known tech company this summer), and participated in undergrad research this semester. I was really really excited about getting accepted into this research program because from the sound of it, they do some really cool AI research and I feel like it'd be a great way to expand my knowledge in the field. 

However, my parents feel like I'll be "doing too much" for something that "only helps if you're interested in grad school." 

It's true I'm planning to go into the industry once I finish up my studies, but I don't feel like this is utterly useless. **What are the benefits of participating in a research program like this?** I want to get into data science work once I graduate, so I thought this would be a great thing to display on my resume. **Am I wrong to think that?**

CS 421 with Elsa Gunter (SP '21)
Hi!

I'm planning to take CS 421 next semester, but it looks like there's both an online and in-person section. I was wondering if anyone knows:

1. If CS 421 online is easier/better/more convenient than CS 421 in person?
2. Can anyone speak to the time commitment/difficulty of the class?
3. Are there any steps I can take to make it an easier experience i.e. starting study groups, collaboration on assignments, etc. ?
4. What is the class like with Elsa? I've heard awesome things

For more context... I'm not trying to half ass this class, but I also have a lot going on next sem (I'm planning to take CS 361, CS 210, CS 411, CLCV 224, CS 397 \[participating in research program 10hr/wk\], *and* doing a 10hr/week co-op).

I'd like to have enough time to dedicate to this class, so would appreciate any heads up about what the course is like in terms of workload and amount of time we need to dedicate.

**EDIT: I'd still love to hear any thoughts about 421, please send your opinions my way!!**

1. How much of six pack is partying? Would I be out of place in six pack if I don‚Äôt like to party?
2. Are there other rec centers/gyms besides the arc? 
3. What libraries are there near bromley and six pack?
4. I‚Äôve heard bromley is it‚Äôs own ‚Äúsocial bubble‚Äù. How different is life in bromley vs a dorm like Weston?
5. Any general insight anyone can give on these dorms would be great.

What confidence do you have that ICES questionnaire responses remain anonymous?
I'm a graduate student who was really excited about one of my classes this semester. Initially it seemed like it would have a really neat setup. But things have not gone well. But I've also been told by everyone not to get into it or in any way piss off your graduate professors. :-|

* It was supposed to be online synchronous but the week classes began he switched it to asynchronous so we can't ask questions in real time. 
* He has no defined office hours and has been a little inconsistent in responding to things. There is also no TA so nobody else to ask questions.
* He has us doing programming in a language that isn't listed as a prerequisite, hasn't told us how to use it (not a single line of code in class) and when I e-mailed him asking if his next lecture ... or any lecture ... could include instruction he said "no I'm still learning it too" but then takes off points when we fail to figure out the code ourselves on something that was never taught in class.
* He has changed the grading structure a couple times through class but never updated the syllabus to show us what he changed it to so none of us have any idea how we're doing in the class.
* His examples of problems in classes are simplified like 2+2 = 4 but then the tests are crazy hard. Then when  most of the class fails he is just like "that's what I expected, I knew I made this test hard". And I'm like "I'm paying $10,000 a semester for you to not teach me the stuff you think I need to know??".  I really like my program and I like the material in this class. But this professor has really disappointed me so far. Probably an alright guy but damn; having to go beyond what he is teaching to learn what I need is impacting my other classes.

It is the professor's first time teaching the class and so far I'm not enjoying being the guinea pig. I think the class has a lot of potential but he has really not done good job. I have no idea what I'm going to get in the class, could be an A, could be worse, but I'm super mad about how the class has gone.

I'd like to give direct and honest feedback in the ICES questionnaire but I'm afraid of there being negative repercussions later. I'm curious how you all feel about situations like this.

Would any stock trading/investing students be interested in a groupchat for DD and sharing stock research?
Hi friends,

I was wondering if there are any other stock trading students out there who complete Due Diligence and technical analysis themselves on stocks and that are serious about trading (day trading, swing trading, options, etc). I ask because I think a groupchat of university-educated people discussing our research and suggestions could serve to be very profitable for all. Unfortunately, existing subreddits on this topic have become very saturated with meme and pump and dump stocks that are dangerous for anyone‚Äôs portfolios. If people are interested, maybe we could go ahead and create a GroupMe, a WeChat, a Whatsapp, a Reddit chat (if that‚Äôs a thing) or whatever. I‚Äôm sure we could find a way to be anonymous too if you are worried about privacy. We are all trying to make some extra money, so I thought this could be a really good thing; instead of getting info or suggestions on just one stock a day, you might be able to get 8 that you should go in and maybe 4 that you absolutely should not. Let me know if you‚Äôd be interested!

confused with which offer to accept
Hi, I am currently studying CS at UIC(The University of Illinois at Chicago).

I am trying to transfer from here to someplace nice.

I got accepted at UIUC for CS + crop science major, NC state CS major.

I am confused with which offer I should accept because first UIUC has recently started this cs + crop science program no class has graduated from this program yet. So this made me nervous about whether I should accept the offer or not. I am mainly concerned if the graduate school at UIUC will accept someone from a major like CS + CropScience for a master's degree in the area of machine learning( machine learning is my passion ).

I am confused with NC state because this is an out-of-state university for me and changing a state for two years is something that is making me confused. I can not answer a question like is it worth it to move everything to NC?

If someone can suggest something to me will be greatly appreciated

Thank you

living alone on campus next year
hi everyone! not sure if i‚Äôm using the right flare for this, so if it‚Äôs wrong lmk and i can change it. i‚Äôm just looking to get some advice about returning to campus next semester and living alone for the first time ever. 

i‚Äôm a girl from chicago, currently a sophomore so the pandemic began during the 2nd semester of my freshman year. i have pretty bad ocd, anxiety, and depression which have taken a bit of a hold on me during this past year, and they also have affected my physical health more than any other time in my life. i signed a lease for a 2021-22 studio apartment alone as opposed to getting a 2 bed with a roommate, so i could have my boyfriend, mom, and best friend come visit whenever because they‚Äôre all in chicago too. i‚Äôve been living with my bf since a couple months after the pandemic began to could quarantine together, and we go between living at our family‚Äôs houses together, so that whole support system of mine will be in chicago (he goes to college at ccc right now but is hoping to transfer to uiuc soon for engineering).

my main thing is that i‚Äôve never lived alone before and never even considered it bc my separation anxiety and ocd stuff make it kinda not ideal for me, but i didn‚Äôt have much of a choice bc my friends got their leases months ago and i didn‚Äôt want a random roommate. my friends on campus have all let me know they support me, and i plan to go back to chicago pretty frequently or have people come visit me, but i still feel so scared. i‚Äôm trying to be positive and see the bright side of things, one being that my studio apartment really is beautiful and brand-new, so having a nice living space will at least help a bit. if anyone has any type of advice or has been in a similar situation as me i would love to hear about it!

Caffe Bene Mocha
Hi UIUC! I‚Äôm an alumni that moved to Chicago but I miss the Caffe Bene mocha so very much. I‚Äôve looked everywhere but I‚Äôve never found anything like it. Does anyone have any tips to recreate it at home so I don‚Äôt need to make the trip down for some good mocha? Obviously it won‚Äôt be the same but I would love to try. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

Best AI/ML CS Course
I'm not set on specializing in AI/ML or anything but definitely want to get some exposure to the fundamentals as I will probably use them in the future. I'm trying to figure out which is the most useful of the CS AI/ML courses. I've read a lot about the 3 main ones, and this is in general what I've gathered based on that:

* CS 440 AI: Not too difficult, more MP focused and not much theory
* CS 446 ML: More math and theory/focused, MPs build ML algorithms. Have read negative things about structure of this course
* CS 498 AML: Focused on applying ML practically, but have read negative things about the structure of the course as well

Overall I'm trying to get the best value and balance between theory/application as possible as I probably will only have time to take one of these courses, 2 at most. If anyone who has taken these can share their experience I'd appreciate it.

Are There Any Sober Extroverts on Campus?
I'm a incoming transfer student that came to visited this past Friday and experienced pretty big culture shock. I knew that Greek and bar life was a big part of UIUC but it felt like the only thing people were doing. I also just had a pretty negative experience as the people I was meeting up with to potentially room with next semester were not the nicest people and big on parties (Even though they explicitly said that they weren't when we were texting). The issue is that when I say I'm looking for people that don't drink I only can find people that don't go out and just stay in and play video games all day (and are generally more introverted). There is nothing wrong with these type of people but it's just not my kind of crowd. With nearly 50,000 kids I know there has to be people that don't drink but still take full advantage of college life, I just don't know where to find them.

I know getting involved in clubs in the best way to meet people but does anyone have any other suggestions on how to find people like this? Are there specific clubs that are substance free? Any suggestions would mean a lot.

Thanks!

Single Room Housing for Undergraduates?
I'm an incoming freshman and I'm currently completing the Residence Hall Contract. I'm in the location preferences section right now and noticed that the only room preference options available are double and triple (for all halls).

I understand that single housing is obviously limited and that realistically only the people picked first for randomized room selection will get single rooms. However, I also heard about a student who graduated from my high school last year who was able to get a single room. 

It also says that preferences aren't binding. So, do I just select double housing for the rooms I prefer?

Refused water at Spoonhouse?
I don't want to effect or change anyone's views on Spoonhouse or anything but recently I was denied a cup of water there and wanted to ask if that was normal. I'm an international so I don't really know my way around this, but I thought water was always provided at restaurants in summer?

Edit: I was eating there, I didn't go in asking for a cup of water.

absolute easiest QR & NW gen eds possible?
Title makes it clear. I'd ideally like something with minimal or very fun reading only because I've some reading-heavy classes this sem. For QR, either 1 or 2 is fine but I've taken stats so that's not an option, I'm really bad with math and STEM as a whole, so anything easy would be real appreciated. 

Specifically looking into REL 104 and EALC 230. For QR, I might wait till the spring and try GLBL 200 or IS 145 just because everything this sem looks real scary.

Thanks in advance!

How to study for SPAN 130
If anybody has taken SPAN 130 or any other Spanish or language course at UIUC, what‚Äôs the best way to study for the Final Exam. I know it will be on Vocab, grammar and some readings, but how should I study for it?

Any advice helps! Thanks so much!

BS/MCS: What should I do?
I am a CS Eng Major who had applied to the BS/MCS for Fall 2021. In my essay, I wrote that I am taking "CS 425 to further my knowledge in the field that I am planning to make my career in", however I ended up dropping the class after I submitted my application since I thought I'd rather take the class later when I have more maturity about the subject (i.e. after 241 and not along with it) To what extent has this drop affected my chances of getting into the MCS program and what can I possibly do to better my situation? Could I attach an extra note to my application updating them about my situation?

Thoughts on Phil 421 - Ethical Theories?
I need to take this class, but I'm worried about the essays because I'm an outstandingly poor writer. Has anyone taken 421 with Bojanowski? If so, what kind of writing is involved, and how harshly is that writing graded?

Other general class info is nice, but I'm mostly worried about the writing.

Looking for some new places to study
Now that things have been opening back up what are some places I can study at? 

Looking for something with free parking, an outlet to plug in my laptop, and no expectation of buying anything (coffee shops are fine if I can just sit and do my work). Also if it's a place where I can meet some other grad students that's even better.

How's the social life for grad students living in dorms (Daniels, Sherman, etc.)?
Hello, I am a new international grad student who is also deciding where I should live.

I want to live in a school dorm for the first year so I can acclimate to school life easier.

After some digging, it seems that Daniels Hall is a quiet place, wonderful for studying, but I am wondering what's the social life there gonna be. Apparently, not many students live there, so do people live in those dorms feel isolated? I don't want a boring grad life.

From Ivor:

‚ÄúI expected more thorough change to the current disciplinary procedure regarding COVID-19 testing noncompliance. This clearly did not happen,‚Äù Chen said. ‚ÄúAll of us expected the disciplinary system to be humane and nuanced, and at the very least, to be fair and just."

‚ÄúWe expected the system to be transparent and responsive to students needs because the university has a duty of care for its students.‚Äù

lonely researcher
anyone else feel super lonely/left out with their research group? idk whether it's research in general or the pandemic, but my prof basically ignores my emails unless i catch him at the right time or send a bunch of follow up emails, even if it's a response to an earlier email i sent. i don't have any other contact with my lab - i think they have a slack i'm not on because the group meetings we're supposed to have every week keep changing times/dates without me having any clue, but they never mentioned anything to me and i've been way too scared to ask all semester. i totally understand being the group's last priority (i'm a lot younger than everyone else there), but it kinda feels like i'm wasting everyone's time when i'm not doing anything new and routinely get ignored. does this happen to everyone when they start out? or do other research groups function differently? not sure if there's something that i should've been doing that i'm not :(

Schedule Check and Advice
\[PHYS 325\]

\[MATH 441\] or \[MATH 285\]

\[MATH 416H\] or \[MATH 416\] (may switch to \[CS 225\] if I don't need Linear algebra for this semester) 

 A GEN - ED

1.Would Appreciate any general advice for each of these classes, especially Phys 325 since Phys 225 is giving me a bit of a tough time.

2. Is the 416 honours section a huge time sink? How difficult is the honours section compared to 416? How difficult is 416 generally?

3. How difficult is it to take Math 441 or Math 416H/416 without Math 347?. I have studied quite a bit about proofs, but haven't taken Math 347 formally

4. What is the advantage of taking 441 over 285 in terms of later physics classes? (I am a physics major for reference)

5.Any easy gen eds or a class that would complement these classes without making my schedule unbearable?

Transfer EE to CE Question
Hi,

I've been admitted to electrical engineering at Grainger for the class of 2025. I wanted to know how early can I switch to computer engineering. I've heard people say that it's much much easier to switch from EE to CE than EE to CS. So, how early in college can switch to computer engineering? And, are there any specific requirements that I should be aware of?

Any CE majors who switched from EE or any other major, please could you share your experience and any advice if possible

Party Culture
Hi, I‚Äôm a recently admitted freshman transfer. I‚Äôve always viewed UIUC as great academically and I was happy when I was accepted. I went down to visit a few friends this past week and learned a bit more about the life on campus and more specifically the party culture. I‚Äôve never been that big on parties but I‚Äôll go if I have the time and feel fine with going. I was just wondering if anyone had any tips about finding the balance between the parties here and academics, and maybe some res halls/apartments that don‚Äôt have too many

No Internship after Junior Year
After 100s of applications, 4 interviews, and no offers it's looking like I'm not gonna have an internship this summer. I have one last interview, but it's for a web dev position and the last time I've done any web dev was two years ago.

What should I do over the summer? I'm thinking of trying to get some kind of basic service job but I'm worried that would look bad when I'm searching for a full time offer next year.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Any kind of advice is helpful :).
--------------------------------------------------
Question from incoming Freshman
I‚Äôve been admitted to LAS Physics although my first choice major was compsci. What are my options? How often do students transfer or double major with compsci? Also, is there a difference between LAS and CoE Physics, and will it affect my chances of getting into the compsci program?

Thank You so much!

Purdue FYE or UIUC Pre Engineering?

ECE scheduling help
hey guys I‚Äôm gonna be a Junior next fall &amp;amp; im conflicted on what classes I should take together.

I‚Äôm an EE transferring to CompE but I won‚Äôt know the decision until this summer so there that too.

For context, I took ECE 210, Math 286, and CS 225 this sem and it was honestly challenging for me to stay on top of 210 material.

In addition, I am interested in green energy/electronics, but also heavy software stuff like AI/ML/Big Data &amp;amp; robotics.

Here are the 4 options im considering:

ECE 385, ECE 313, ECE 398ML (ideally would like to put off 313 until later)

ECE 385, ECE 486, and ECE 398ML

ECE 374, ECE 486, and ECE 398ML

ECE 374, ECE 310, and ECE 398ML

Transfer from AE to other engineering
Hi! I'm an incoming freshman accepted for fall 2021 aerospace engineering.

Where do I find out when my second shot is.
I got my first Moderna shot on 4/9 at CRCE, and they told me to come back on 5/7 for my second dose.

Does anyone know how I can find this information?

Edit: McKinley just sent me an email saying I can register for my second dose, just signed up for the 13th :)

CS 240 vs. CS 233/241
From what my advisor told me CS 240 is intended for CS+X majors (which I am) instead of CS 233 and 241 (credit hours are made up for with a CS elective). I'm mostly interested in data science and applications of computer science, so I have a sense that system programming and lower-level languages probably aren't my thing. Is there any reason I should take 233 and 241, like big things I'll be missing out on in 240? Any advice appreciated

CS class advice
I'm a rising sophomore who is planning on taking CS 233, CS 357, CS 361 and CS 225 next semester. Is this schedule a bad idea (I did not struggle in 173 at all and 126 was manageable with the exception of one project). Also does anyone have any advice on how to do well in these classes and which teachers to avoid (if applicable)?

Best Class You Ever Took?
Next fall will be my ninth, and last, semester. I only need to take one more course, but I don't want to just take one class. I also don't want to take easy A courses unless they are also really interesting too.  

Anyways, what course(s) have you taken on campus that you felt were most useful towards your life/career? Or courses that maybe weren't useful but were fun and an experience you know you won't be able to get anywhere else?

Stay safe tomorrow
There‚Äôs an internet ‚Äòjoke‚Äô going around about creating a ‚Äònational rape day‚Äô tomorrow (Apr 24). With the nice weather, the weekend, and overall getting near the end of the semester, I‚Äôd just like to encourage anyone who is thinking about going out tomorrow to either reconsider and stay in or stay close with a group of trusted people. The whole idea sounds insane but there are idiots and assholes out there who may take it seriously. 
Stay safe everyone.

CHEM 102/103 SM21 -> UIUC vs Parkland
I'm an electrical engineering major looking to take CHEM 102/103 over the summer. So far as I know, it's not important for electrical engineering majors to actually UNDERSTAND chemistry; we just have to take it because... some faculty dude somewhere thought it would be nice to make us well rounded idk. Am I fine taking the course at Parkland? Is there any reason I might need to actually KNOW the content of CHEM 102/103 as an EE major (other than passing the class). Or is it just a bullshit requirement.

Also, has anyone taken CHEM 102/103 as a summer course (here or at Parkland)? Thoughts. Is there really a difference between the way the schools teach the course?

Also (#2), I've heard that the Parkland class is even pretty hard, because they try to keep up with UIUC. Let's say this course is total bullshit for my major, and I don't actually need to know shit from it. What community colleges do you recommend where I can get an easy A instead of having to slave away learning information I don't need to know, and maybe spend the summer doing something interesting and useful instead, like research.

Couple of questions for ECE incoming freshman
Hi, I'm an incoming EE student who's recently started to self-learn python and am really enjoying it. As a result, I want to learn more about coding and software in general, even though hardware remains my priority as of now. I have 2 questions:

1. In case I do want to end up working in software, would it be more beneficial for me to simply add a CS minor or should I try to switch into CompE? I understand that a switch to CS is out of question so I want to gain as much exposure to software while still focusing and learning about hardware primarily. Which of two would be more beneficial when applying for internships or jobs in software if I do end up deciding to go for SWE?
2. How bad of a position am I in right now if I'm looking to learn CS? I've started python about a month ago and am still somewhat of an amateur. As a result of my lack of knowledge currently, how badly would this affect the ECE or CS classes I plan to take? I can't do much this summer because I'm taking a couple online classes at Parkland so looking further than that, what do y'all advise me to do?

I've read quite a bit on this sub about how most ECE students end up working in software anyway which is what got me thinking.

UIUC‚Äôs Aerospace Engineering Opportunities
Hello! I am considering UIUC aerospace engineering. My dream is to work at NASA or SpaceX like a lot of students. My question is, what companies regularly recruit from the school and what kinds of amazing internship opportunities have you or other people you know have gotten with the help from the resources at UIUC? Do you have any regrets or things you would do differently as an engineering student in general?

STOP FUCKING CHEATING
I'M SO FUCKING ANGRY AT SOME OF YOU IDIOTS. You think you're getting away with plagiarism but you're really not. If you're stupid enough to cheat, you're stupid enough to cheat badly and get caught. I'm talking about CS courses specifically but seriously don't cheat on any course. Ever heard of MOSS? That's what they use to compare code. It's really good and you can't just "change variable names" and get away with it. Moss doesn't care about your variable names. It crawls up your eye sockets, scans your brain, finds that you're a dumbass who thinks you can change it up a little so the teacher won't notice, and flags you. If you've cheated at any point you're probably getting hit with a FAIR violation at the end of the semester. Yes, you'll get blindsided at the end of the semester with a violation. Get ready to have a black mark on your transcript forever because you thought it would be fun to work with your buddies on what is clearly an individual project. Seriously, you may think you're a big brained cheater who could never get caught, but you're probably small brained and small pp too and you're 100% getting caught. Stop cheating.

What can I do for the summer to prepare for the materials? [Prospective BioE major]
Hello, I'm an incoming freshman planning on choosing my major as BioE (accepted as Undeclared) pre-med track.

I have a few questions:

1. Is there anything I could prepare for college courses over the summer? I'd like to know about the summer credits for the incoming freshman and if we're eligible to those, and especially other ways to prepare myself.
2. Is there anything specific for UIUC BioE classes, or UIUC classes in general that I should be aware of?
3. I did take AP, but I'm really bad at FRQs, where I have to put all my knowledge the question is asking for within a limited time. Any tips for that?

I know these questions are share overlapping area, thank you for reading through, they got longer than expected :P

Housing recommendations
Hi everyone! 

I'm a student from Italy coming to UIUC law school next year in order to attend a master in law. I'm having some troubles in choosing the accommodation; the options are a lot and not knowing anyone already on campus it's kind of difficult for me to understand which are the best options. Do you have any tips for me? I'd prefer something off campus and with the possibility to meet people. Something like tower at third I think would suit me but I'm open to all your recommendations!! Thanksss

Worried about being dropped
I was put on academic probation this semester and I'm worried I won't make the GPA I need, despite my overall GPA still being just barely under a 3.0. Am I automatically dropped if I don't? Does taking classes with Covid-Credit/No Credit still could towards this GPA? I'm just really stressed out about this and needed a place to be heard. I've been too embarrassed to tell anyone about this.

Recommendations for advanced MCB courses?
Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm a junior in MCB, and I will have completed MCB 354 by the end of this semester, so I only need advanced MCB courses for the next two semesters. 

Does anyone have any suggestions about what advanced courses to take? Any courses with good professors, interesting topics, fair grading, etc would be helpful to know about. I‚Äôm feeling a little overwhelmed like I‚Äôm just randomly choosing my advanced courses based on the title, because I don‚Äôt know too much about any of them.

Any information or experiences you can share would be very much appreciated!!

ECE 329 and CS 173 over the summer
Can anyone let me know how difficult both of these classes are over a summer session? I'm also managing some research on top of this work and I'm afraid I won't have enough energy to balance all this work.
--------------------------------------------------
Anyone who‚Äôs also feeling overwhelmed and stressed out wants to share your story?
I‚Äôll go first.

I screwed up on a gen Ed course today. I was supposed to take an exam that‚Äôs worth 12% of the total today. But I didn‚Äôt since the menstrual pain almost killed me. I really thought of going to McKinley at a point. Took the pain relief but I started feeling nauseous. Anyways, I thought the exam ended at 12pm so I just let myself pass out, but it actually ended at 8. So after I woke up finding I have already missed the exam. I‚Äôm just so disappointed at myself. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure I will get the COVID pass if I want to. 12% is really not a big deal and it‚Äôs just a gen-ed. But I just can‚Äôt help hate myself and my life. I studied 2 days for this course and was hoping for an A that‚Äôll prolly make my GPA look better. I know it‚Äôs not a big thing but NOT EVEN THIS COURSE. It‚Äôs just like nothing ever wants to go on as the way I expect at this time. 

I‚Äôm trying so hard to tell myself it‚Äôs fine and the others are suffering as well. But whenever I look around at my friends, they all seem to be pretty happy with their life, their interns, their coursework, and so on. 

Sorry if my words are too illy structured that you can‚Äôt understand. And I certainly don‚Äôt mean to bring any pressure or stress to anyone. For me I feel better if I share my bad things with the others and then find out they have some as well. So I made this post for those who are feeling the same and wants to share with each other.
