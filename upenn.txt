On-Campus Transportation
I've been reviewing my fin aid package and I was wondering why there was such a substantial on campus transportation amount. Do people regularly use transportation to get around campus or would this be an overestimated expense? I appreciate any help! :)

Taking a class without the prerequisite
I was in a class once that I hear had a pretty strongly enforced prereq but knew someone who didn't take the prereq yet and they were still able to take the class and get the credit. Did they just get lucky? If the department were to find out that a student didn't do the prereq after the class was already over would they do anything about it (I don't think they'd be allowed to take the credit back right?) If they find out halfway through the semester would they just kick you out of the class? I'm curious. Past experiences appreciated!

Is this a scam?
I'm an incoming freshman to Penn, specifically Wharton. I recently received an email (to my email acct I had affiliated with my Penn admissions portal and WISR) by a Professor within Penn offering a research opportunity. Being a HS senior with no job/research experience I was quick to accept. I made sure the person emailing me was real before replying (their email had the (@)wharton.upenn.edu and was on the UPenn page). The Professor in question also said that it would be a paid position (relevant later on). He sent a 'task' which was to compile a basic excel spreadsheet with info about his research. Pretty straightforward and was alright.

&#x200B;

This morning I received an email saying he had a second task. Within this task was the following: " purchase two $250 prepaid physical Cards from any of the listed retail outlets near you". This sounded like an obvious scam to me, since prepaid cards are almost always part of some scam. He claims the $500 is needed for an online survey service that I enlist to. Additionally, he claims that this payment is urgent and should've done within 1-2 days. Minutes later I receive another email with a check in my name from a well-known bank for the $500 to buy these cards, the weekly 'stipend' that was agreed upon, and some leftover (bonus?). I was then instructed to deposit this check via mobile checking and to buy these cards. I'm left very confused by all this. On the one hand, this seems like a very elaborate scam, with me depositing a check that might bounce and buying these physical prepaid cards before it does. On the other hand, the Professor, by all accounts, seems to be a real person and is communicating with me using his own Penn-affiliated email. What do I do? Has anyone had this happen to them before?

I will link some pictures from the emails as well as the check in question.

[https://imgur.com/a/3tVDo38](https://imgur.com/a/3tVDo38)

Edit: It's scam and I have contacted both the professor and IT dept via email.

not feeling good about grades
sorry for the incoming rant. i’m a freshmen, and i’ve been severely unmotivated and depressed this semester for no reason. i don’t know what’s come over me but it’s making me turn in assignments that are three weeks late which i would’ve never done in high school. 

i just had to turn in my final portfolio for a writing seminar class and i turned it in late even though it was a hard deadline. i’m really upset with myself and don’t know what to do. i feel terrible knowing i fucked up what would have been an easy class.

if you’ve been in this position before, how do you get out of this slump?

A Question about BFS (College) and Uncoordinated Dual Degree b/w CAS and SEAS
Hi, after weeks of deliberation (or self-struggle) I finally decided to commit to UPenn. I was admitted to CAS.

1. **Should I apply for BFS in the College**: I intend to major in math/Logic, Information, and Computation and potentially dual degree at SEAS for CS or Electrical Engineering. It seems the BFS this year focuses on earth science, history of science, anthropology etc. And it suggests that BFS would consume 50% of first term classes and 40% of second term classes. So, is it going to help me in terms of fulfilling major requirement or graduation requirement?
2. **How difficult is it to get a dual degree at SEAS from College?** As mentioned in the last paragraph, how hard would the dual degree application between CAS and SEAS go? I know double major between the two is way easier, but how hard is dual degree essentially? And to apply for dual degree after the end of freshman, is it better to not go to BFS so that I can work toward that direction of dual degree? (by taking some CS classes etc.)
3. **If I want to do CS, and want to learn some theoretical side of CS in the College, is "Logic, Information, and Computation" major a good choice?** Or mathematics, which I originally applied to.
--------------------------------------------------
Why didn’t I get a course that still says it’s open?
Am I just being dumb or like, shouldn’t I have got the course??
EDIT: it turns out that the course is only open to seniors which I didn’t know, but thank you so much to everyone that tried to help figure it out!

Registering for night classes?
I had some classes (PSYC-253-601 and SOCI-001-601) that were night classes, that I tried to request for this fall semester. I didn't get the classes, but both are still open on PennInTouch. Is this because undergrads aren't able to register for night classes? What is the process to register for night classes? Rather important as I am an uncoordinated dual degree, so my schedule is already packed and these count for very specific things. Thanks!

Free Elective Question
Hey guys, prospective Penn CAS student here planning to major in econ, and just had a quick question regarding the major’s c.u. distributions: if I were to want to take more than the suggested four 200 level economic classes, would I be able to roll the extra ones over into free electives? I think (although I could be misunderstanding this) that I would need 12 total c.u. specifically from the economics major and 20 c.u. From sector/gen ed/free elective requirements. Since sector/gen ed is prolly gonna be only 11-14 classes, would I be forced to take 6-9 electives that aren’t associated with the econ program, or could I go more in-depth in advanced econ classes?

Taking grad architecture classes as an undergrad?
Note to mods: don't delete this post because I don't see any users for architecture on the new quakers thread and this question is for grad students

If anyone is a grad student in weitzman I'd like some insight on this

So is it possible to take M.Arch studios and seminars as an undergrad?

I'm an incoming design BA major but I'm really fascinated by the work that I see on the weitzman\_arch Instagram, and I think that out of all the top architecture schools Penn's work is the most speculative/artistic which I think is really cool

I'm also interested in learning about 3d modeling/CAD stuff which a lot of these studios seem to do

I'm trying to challenge myself as much as possible in college and so I figured that taking graduate architecture studios would be the best way to take advantage of Penn's most established program in the arts, plus I think that it'd also help me prepare/decide for if I want to apply to M.Arch programs for grad school

I also know that you can take grad fine arts classes as an undergrad so Im wondering if its the same for architecture

What fields does the LSM program lead into?
I'm a high schooler looking into the LSM program at Penn. From what I'm understanding, it's a dual-degree between the College of Arts & Sciences and Wharton. 

Being that I'm currently interested in both healthcare and business, LSM sounds promising. A question I have though is what fields does this program mainly lead its students into? My assumption is that a science + business education leads into fields such as healthcare consulting, but I'm interested to know if some students decide to go to med school or enter the business world post-grad. 

Also, what are the best dual-degrees to pair? I think I would be interested in pursuing neuroscience and finance (neuro for sure), but I'm super open to new ideas. Feel free to drop any honest advice below, I'm just a high school junior asking questions about a program I probably won't get into anyway haha

Thanks in advance!

Any experience with CAPS for eating disorders? (TW)
First, TW for anyone who is struggling! Don’t feel the need to read more if this is upsetting to you please.

Has anyone used CAPS or any other Penn resources to deal with EDs? Since coming to campus this semester and living alone my ED has kinda spiraled out of control— I’ve lost a substantial amount of weight and it’s beginning to affect my health. Truthfully, Im scared of going and getting officially diagnosed, I really don’t want to be hospitalized or anything like that and I don’t want my parents knowing about this, so I was hoping for some perspectives on some support groups or more informal counseling? 

Please be kind to me!

Senior Regrets
\*Disclaimer\*: I know this is a really exciting time of year for all incoming freshmen, so PLS don't let this post put a damper on your looking forward to Penn! I think this is a problem that some people would face at any university, and I just wanted to start the discussion here.

It's coming up on graduation and I'm having a hard time coming to terms with the social choices I've made over the past few years. Looking back, I really regret not joining Greek life/not making more social connections in general. Scrolling through insta gives me major FOMO and I regret that I didn't try harder to build more social capital. Not only for the future networking benefits, but also because college is supposed to be "the best years of your life" (supposedly). It feels like everyone is doing bigger, better, "scene-y"er things and I can't compete.

This is kinda a vent but I'd also love to hear if any other seniors wish they'd done something differently or if anyone has any thoughts. good luck with finals everyone :)

Uncoordinated Dual Degree: CAS + SEAS; Also School of Communication

Wondering if dual degree is hard to get? (I know internal transfer to Wharton is the hardest, but is dual degree easier than internal transfer?) I see there is an option of declaring a second major at SEAS as a CAS student, wondering how does it differ from the dual degree?

Also, wondering if anyone knows anything about undergraduate program at School of Communication. 

Thanks!

I wanted to see if anyone currently at the campus could lend general experiences related to how student life is, (some of the popular posts here are kindve concerning) or if anyone on a similar track could give advice on if/why this school would(nt) be a good choice

Really any advice or thoughts related to the school are welcome as I am very interested and I want to get to know it better.

Thanks !

Looking for admitted MLS students!
Hey all! If you are a class of 2024 student interested in joining Vagelos MLS, but are not part of the GroupMe, please let me know! 

What is Vagelos MLS: MLS is a rigorous program for students interested in biochemistry, chemistry, biophysics, or physics. Students can either double major with a primary major in biochem, chem, or physics and a second major in any of the sciences, or you can submatriculate (get a masters) in either chemistry or physics - all within the span of 4 years. There is also a subsidized summer research component!

While challenging, I’ve found it to be a very worthwhile experience. I’m happy to answer any questions you might have!

I just enrolled in C/O '25, what's next?
Sorry if this is a stupid question or whatever, but I guess this is the place to ask it. I'm an international so I'm not super familiar with how the enrolment process works, however I submit my deposit last night to accept my spot at Penn (yay). I'm a bit concerned because the only thing that happened after I submit my deposit was an email confirming that I submit my deposit, however nothing indicating that I had fully enrolled yet. 

Am I supposed to do anything else to confirm my spot before May 3 or is submitting the deposit enough? (also i'm not seeking fin aid)

Is Thursday (29th) a Thursday schedule?

Off-Campus Housing Recommendations
Hey all, I'm an incoming GSE student looking for housing within 15-20 minutes walking distance of Penn's campus. I'm not in the US right now, which is making this housing hunt a bit more cumbersome than expected. Reaching out to this group to gain some insight on the off-campus housing search, life in Philly, etc.

Here's what I've gathered so far:

* According to a Philly friend, most grad students live around Cedar Park, so I'd love to know more about that area too but this may be too far a walk for me as I won't have access to a car.
* They also noted to steer clear of "Rittenhouse, Fairmount, Grad Hospital, Point Breeze, Francisville and Brewerytown."
* They also added that: "There’s definitely lines of gentrification that mark off where displacement is happening and becoming urban sprawl but they are kind of fluid? In general I’d say past 52nd is vast majority Black folks living in poverty, and north of Powelton as well, and most of southwest on the south side of Chester especially."

Here's what I'd like to know more about:

* Typical street noise / volume
* How much should I be expecting to pay in rent for (1) a studio, (2) a bedroom in a shared space, (3) a 1 bedroom apartment?  Looks like this can range from $700 to upwards of $1200 around these parts.
* Would appreciate any insights on the neighborhoods near Penn's campus, University City, Spruce Hill, Powelton Village, Mantua. 

Any anecdotes / insight would be much appreciated.  Thanks!

Are intro courses truly introductory at UPenn?
Hi! Most of the math and science classes I was able to take in high school were regular level (non-AP, non-honors). One of my biggest concerns about committing to Penn is the fear that I'll be starting out "behind" all of my peers. Am I expected to go into any intro classes with substantial prior knowledge in chem, bio, calc, or physics? (For reference, I would be majoring in bioengineering.)
--------------------------------------------------
Anyone been placed on academic probation?
So I'm a freshman and I was depressed and fucked up first sem with 2 courses p/f (passed) and 3 c's

Bars
I’m a recent grad from a college in Ohio and moved into the area for a job.  Just wondering what the bar scene is here and what kind of crowds go them.  For example, at my college there were certain bars that generically underclassmen went to and then upperclassmen went to.  Just curious, cause there was a similar post in this subreddit but like 8 years ago.

A letter to my rapist in sigma chi (TW: rape)
 Hi. 

This is long overdue, but it's taken me a while to process and admit to myself what happened. First of all, fuck you. In no way do I want this to start a lot of shit, I frankly am doing this as a way of closure for myself. I know you’ll know who you are and I hope you feel fucking guilty. I suspect you don’t even know you raped me unfortunately, so hopefully this will fucking enlighten you and make you feel like shit for the rest of your pathetic life. 

I knew from the moment I woke up at 5AM to find myself in your bed, that what had happened was wrong. I tried to play it off like I meant for it to happen, but I knew I wouldn’t have chosen to have sex with you while sober. After I immediately walked home at that absurd hour, I stayed in bed the entire next day, confused as to why it happened. How it happened. You raped me and I knew it even if I didn’t want to admit it to myself at the time. 

I always thought that if I got raped I would report my rapist. I would never let someone get away with that. But it was different when it happened to me. I thought you were my friend. I had always considered you a good guy, which was why drunk me was okay when my friends left me alone with you at your frat’s party that night. I thought I’d be safe with you. I thought you’d protect me from other guys and even walk me home. I never knew I’d have to be scared of you.

I don’t remember the walk back to your dorm. I don’t remember taking off my clothes. I dont remember what your fucking dick looks like. I don’t even remember if you wore a condom or not. I only remember a single flashback where I asked, laying flat on my back, if you were done yet. To which you replied “No.” 

I wish I didn’t remember that. It was actually disgusting how you were using my body as a vessel to fuck while I was barely even conscious. How is that even attractive? Or were you just so desperate that you were happy I finally was drunk enough to get home? Tbh you hovered around me at every party I saw you at. It seems like you were trying to use me for a while and I was finally drunk enough that night. I was literally just a warm body for you that night. You’re disgusting.

Even though I knew it was rape for the longest time, I couldn’t admit it to myself. I couldn’t make myself a victim. But subconsciously I knew. I couldn’t bring myself to wear the clothes I was wearing that night. I still can’t.

Nearly a year and half later, I’ve processed what’s happened. I can assure you that this semester has been the worst part of my entire life. I sob almost daily to the point where I can’t breath. I have to take prescribed anxiety medication whenever I feel overwhelmed by the incident. I can’t count the number of times I’ve had to turn off my zoom camera in the middle of class to cry about what you did to me. 

And you know what? Even after hours of therapy and multiple antidepressants to cope with what YOU did to ME, I still blame myself. Part of me still thinks you're a good person which is why I haven’t reported you/confronted you. But you can’t be. The more I think about that night the more I am in complete shock of how you could've done that to me while I was in that state. I was clearly not sober. How did you not know? I was fucking starfished on the bed. Did I even have my eyes open? I was definitely WAY too drunk to consent and you should’ve at least realized that if you didn’t recognize I was blacked out. I did not ever want to have sex with you under ANY circumstances. You’re fucking perverted by being so desperate to get your fucking dick wet that you had to rape a blacked out girl you were “friends” with. I know deep down you’re the guilty person, but even after all of this my heart still puts more blame on myself than you. I was supposed to protect myself. I never wanted to become a part of the statistics, but it feels like I put myself there. But no -- you're the guilty party. 

Now, every relationship I am and will ever be in, this is something that I will have to tell my partner. It will forever affect my ability to have sex and form relationships with men normally. You violated and disrespected me the most by raping me while I was blacked out, completely out of my own control and under yours. I don’t understand how you thought that night was okay.

I don’t know what I want out of this letter. Maybe I want you to know the intense guilt and shame I feel from that night. Maybe I want you to know that your crime has made me feel disconnected from my sense of worth and self-identity. Maybe I don’t want to be slut shamed anymore. Maybe I just want you to know that you aren’t a “nice guy” whether you raped me intentionally or not. You still raped me and I want you to feel guilty for that. I won’t ever accept an apology. I know you knew better. You’re fucking pathetic. Please feel guilty for the rest of your entire life, you . 

You’ve made me feel like my body isn’t even mine. You’ve made me question whether I’m more than just an object or not. You’ve made me question how every guy looks at me when I pass them on the street. You’ve made me ashamed to be a woman. I’ve had to (and still have to) work through so much shit to get to a healthy place with myself.

I know you know who you are. Do not contact me under any circumstances. I can’t believe you casually texted me just 2 days ago. I already have you blocked on everything now anyways. I do not want an apology from you, you could never apologize enough for the pain you’ve put me through.

If you ever see me again, don’t fucking look at me, don’t fucking talk to me, and stay out of all places you’ll know I’ll be at. Just leave me alone forever. 

Hope your life sucks and no woman ever has to interact with you again.

Looking for a full-time role or internship in crypto/DeFi?
Hey everyone! Is anybody interested in working on a really hot crypto/DeFi project? (Mods let me know if not allowed but just wanted to reach out to the cohort).

As I wrap up undergrad, I know first-hand about the pressure to land a good internship/job and been through the whole thing haha so I'm hoping this helps out in that regard and also provides an opportunity to work on something huge.

**About us:**

* Tackling a $60B opportunity in decentralized finance (DeFi).
* Super lucky to have just closed a highly oversubscribed (10x) seed round funded by Tier A investors.
* Pretty chill founding team with deep crypto/tech/finance experience (e.g. Citadel, Goldman, Google, TikTok, AWS) and extremely passionate about the fintech/crypto space as a whole.
* Just genuinely enjoy building paradigm-shifting products so needless to say, we're bullish AF.

Pretty flexible in terms of employment options (full-time/part-time/internship/contractor) as I care a lot more about the actual individual themselves. With that said, we're looking to grow the team by a few and hope to bring on:

* **Solidity engineer:** self-explanatory.
* **Full-stack engineer/React engineer/QA:** Role would really depend on person's experience + goals but overall, need to be really good with React. Must have solid front-end + decent user experience development. Everything else is a plus such as solidity, QA, etc. We can make this role whatever the person wants to make it.
* **Growth/Community/Marketer**: This role is really cool. Gotta be really good at creating content, building community, socials, customer success, memes, business development, etc. Crypto-related experience not necessary but need to be tech-informed and really good at fostering community + growth.  Helpful if you already have a decent personal brand but not necessary.
* **Sense of humor required :)**

Still interested but not one of the above? Ping me and let's chat more. Would love to learn more about you and talk more about what we're building!

Covid Test for International Travel
Anyone know if Penn will give us certificates/proof of negative covid tests for international travel when we go home? I'm international and need a proof of negative test within 72 hours, and given that Penn tests us so frequently, I assume this should be pretty easy for them to do but I haven't heard anything.

Taking Graduate Courses As an Undergraduate
The last day of classes for undergraduates is April 29th, but my professor for my graduate-level course is having classes until May 11th. Although the class is a graduate-level course, there are only undergraduates in the course. Have other undergraduate students had similar experiences taking classes beyond the official last day of classes?

ROBO Masters questions/impressions/chat?
Some of you may recall that I made a post on this subreddit 1.5 years ago when I was anticipating coming to Penn on my exchange year from Edinburgh Uni. Sadly, due to COVID, this was cancelled and won't be rearranged, so the prospect of coming to Penn during my undergraduate is no longer a reality.

This is quite sad as I was really eager to experience Penn life and education, and consequently I have been researching into options for postgraduate study at the University. I am a Computer Science major specialising within robotics, of which Penn is very strong in, and their ROBO Masters programme looks quite appealing (provided I was to attain a scholarship/financial support in the UK to go! I know there isn't any financial support from the University for internationals especially at postgrad Masters level).

I was just wondering if anyone who is currently on this programme could share their honest opinions and impressions of how it is? 2 years is quite a long time for a Masters (by my British standards - in the UK a Masters is only 1 year). Or if anyone would like to DM me/Zoom that could be great too - keen to hear the inside story!

I am interested to learn about what the courses are like, the opportunities to get involved in the actual research, the optional thesis component etc. Please reach out!

Thanks :))

How easy is it to move into the Radian?
Do they provide moving carts and such? How do you even get your keys and everything? How do you even get into the building? How do you even get to your room? I'm not bringing a lot next semester because I definitely want to pack light, but I'm still a little concerned that it might be hard to move all my items in smoothly. I know these are questions I should be asking them, but I was curious how easy it was for people to move in and out?

Do you feel safe walking to your dorm from class?
To anyone who has taken a class until 4:30 PM or 5 PM in the fall semester: Do you feel safe walking to your dorm from class? How dark is it at this point in the fall semester? Asking for safety reasons. And mainly for the dorms farthest from campus (i.e. Gregory). 

Thanks!

Experiences with IPD 509?
Hi! I'm a rising sophmore and interested in taking IPD 509 to count as a humanities requirement + maybe an EENT elective. The class seems pretty interesting and has a relatively low difficulty rating. However, it does say that it's recommended for "upper level undergraduates" so I'm not sure if I'm part of the target audience. Has anyone taken this class before and can share their experience with it? Thanks!

cis120 vs cis110
Hello, I wanted to read people's opinions about the workload between cis120 and cis110, I'm thinking of doing 120 next semester but not sure. Is it more time-consuming? harder? I did good on the cis110 hws but the midterms were a bit iffy.
--------------------------------------------------
Pass fail question
I pass failed phil001 earlier in the semester. The class has a lecture and recitation component. It looks like I pass failed the lecture component, rather than recitation. Was this a mistake? I'm afraid the recitation carries credit for the course while the lecture is worth 0cu... Was I supposed to pass fail both? On my schedule the lecture says "pass fail" but the recitation has no such mark.

Financial Aid Letter of Appeal
Hey everyone! I'm a recent class of '25 admit. I know that it's a long shot, but I was hoping to send Penn a letter of appeal. I'm just not sure where to send it. Is it appropriate to send it to the sfsmail@pobox.upenn.edu email?

CogSci: BIBB 109 or BIBB 249?
Part of the breadth requirements for the CogSci major is a neuroscience course, either BIBB 109 or 249. My concentration is Computation and Cognition so I don't have to specifically take 109—I can take either, and both fit in my schedule for next semester.

My guess is that BIBB 109 will be easier, but probably not by much. If anyone has taken either or both, let me know your opinions!

Enrollment deposit waiver
Hi guys.

I got into Penn in c/o 2025 and will commit soon. I am aware a $400 enrollment deposit has to be paid but I have heard it is automatically waived in some cases if someone applies for financial aid. I have received financial aid that covers full tuition, so has my deposit been waived?
--------------------------------------------------
For the PSCI major, can you double count a core and sub field?
So like let’s say PSCI 181. That fulfills one of the core requirements, but does that also fulfill the “political theory” sub field requirement? Or do I have to take another course to fulfill the sub field? 

It says the PSCI major is 12 courses so I’m not sure if you can that. 

Thanks!

CIS 240 in the Summer
I know it's a bit too early for me to think about it but I've been trying to plan out what I would be taking Spring 2021. I am worried about taking CIS 240 + CIS 261 with other CIS electives in the spring because I've heard 240 is notoriously difficult in the spring so I'm wondering if it is any easier in the summer. Would taking the 11-week summer course be a better way to split up my workload, including if I may be doing internships in the summer? Is the summer course easier?

Thoughts on CIS320?
Debating whether to take it in the fall or the spring. Is it worth waiting for Sanjeev or should I j take it with the current prof in the fall? How much overlap is there w 121?

As a side note, how similar to Rajiv is Sanjeev in terms of teaching style?
--------------------------------------------------
Scheduling
Would taking Physics 230, Physics 361, and Physics 364 along with Econ102 and an easy gen Ed be too difficult of a schedule. I am not worried about Econ 102 but mainly Physics 230 and 361 in the same semester.

CIS 262 Schedule
I am planning on taking CIS 240 next semester. I'm deciding on adding CIS 262 and PHYS 151 next semester. However, there is only one CIS 262 section, and it overlaps with the good PHYS prof's section. I could take PHYS 151 with the bad prof who has a 1.8 rating, or postpone physics until a later semester. 

Do you guys think I should take PHYS 151 next semester, or take MATH 240 instead? And would either of those two classes be self-studyable so that the prof doesn't really matter when actually taking the class? Any advice would be appreciated.

Environmental Policy & Management Concentration Thoughts?
Hi everybody! Quick question regarding the Environmental Policy & Management Concentration.

I'm currently a sophomore planning on concentrating in BEPP and STAT and I was wondering if it would be worth it to swap BEPP with EPM as I'm hoping to work in energy consulting.

I haven't met anyone with the concentration and, although I'm somewhat certain on working in energy consulting, I'd love to hear what folks have to think as well as if it will harmfully impact recruiting.

Thank you!

Most interesting electives?
I'm going to be a senior next year and am struggling with picking out classes for next semester.  I'm doing the CIS BAS and I finished my CIS requirements, my project requirements, engineering requirements, etc.  I got halfway through an engineering entrepreneurship minor but I won't be finishing.  To be honest, I am having a lot of trouble feeling the same excitement I had for taking new classes as I did pre-covid, but I want to pick out some interesting elective courses to take before I graduate.

What are some of the most interesting and rewarding courses you guys took here at Penn? I feel so overwhelmed by all the academic disciplines that are offered here that I never took advantage of.  What are some classes that you took for fun that ended up being a good time?  Would appreciate the help :)

Hi all! I'm looking for a subletter for my furnished room in the Radian from the end of May - end of July. I'm offering it for substantially cheaper than my actual rent. Pm me if you're interested!
--------------------------------------------------
Penn still wants us to social distance and wear masks in the fall when everyone is vaccinated. Good luck getting a bunch of college students who’ve (mostly) not been partying for a year-plus to go along with that.

CIS 120 grading, curve?
I’ve got about a 92 homework average (1-8). 80 midterm average. Full credit for recitations, poll everywhere. Can someone chime in where I might land grade wise, assuming I maintain the same averages on the last hw and final?

Is an A unlikely? A-? B? Is there ever a curve?

Trans life at Penn ?
Hi All,

I'll be matriculating at Penn this Fall and was wondering if anyone knew how Trans life is at Penn or how Trans-accepting the campus and surrounding city are ? Also how accessible is medical transition assistance at student health or other local options ?

Thanks !

[Academic] Luxury Fashion Survey ( People who have purchased luxury fashion items)
Hi Guys!

My name is Matt and I'm a senior university student studying Marketing. I'm new to this subreddit and am conducting a survey for my senior thesis. I would love your to hear your responses on how brand loyalty habits towards luxury fashion brands during the global pandemic has affected intent to purchase. We conducted a descriptive research design between some of the top designer brands regarding the some following factors:

1. Product Quality
2. Scarcity
3. Social Media Engagement
4. Economic Consciousness
5. Brand Loyalty
6. Intent to Purchase

If you could please take a few minutes to complete this survey, it will be much appreciated! Here is the link: [https://qfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_2npCORLydneAjeS](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fqfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com%2Fjfe%2Fform%2FSV_2npCORLydneAjeS&data=04%7C01%7Cmlnava%40cpp.edu%7Cd77b88be74644918bfda08d9039f837a%7C164ba61e39ec4f5d89ffaa1f00a521b4%7C0%7C0%7C637544805900395704%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=ALoY2UlWgXLmVw2pOTltJQn4k3VDb8skW7%2FnWTNclcU%3D&reserved=0)

Housing Advice!
i'm currently deciding between two options with one seeming a lot more riskier than the other. 

OPTION 1: I could live in a furnished apt  (the radian) with three other people that I don't know so well but are my year at Penn and end up paying around $1100 each month which would come up to $13200 for the whole year, which is quite pricey on a financial aid package that only gives me 14K for housing and dining. It would be a secure building and still feel super safe as well and be close to a bunch of places. 

OPTION 2:  Live in a decently safe street on Pine with a few seniors and also a few other people I don't know too well, but this wouldn't be a lease but rather an academic year-long sublet ( a freshman subletting their off campus housing) , which sort of scares me because I don't want to end up in some weird sort of leasing situation since the others will be moving out and I don't want to be responsible for furniture or rent after the subletting period. This option would be 10,800 for twelve months which is a whole lot cheaper, but I definitely don't want to get stuck in a weird situation where I would need to worry about someone else's furniture, etc that they left behind!

Both wouldn't be a long term option for my whole time at Penn and I don't know if it's worth it to live in a nicer place with more amenities versus taking the cheaper option and saving a few thousand bucks to put towards something else! Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Graduate a semester early?
I am currently a junior but I'm confident I'll be eligible to graduate after my first semester of senior year. However, I'm not too sure if I should. I'm a highly aided student so cost isn't really a concern. I was thinking of maybe working at a NGO abroad or across country for 6 months before I start a full time job (hopefully). Or, I was thinking of traveling for a few months and living with my family afterwards. As I contemplate my decision, it feels I would be making the wrong choice as I'm giving up a semester of an ivy league education. But then again, I've never really felt an attachment to Penn or its classes. In the end, I just really want to enjoy the last time I have as a young adult with few responsibilities while also putting myself out there. If anyone has any advice or experience with graduating a semester early that would be great. I know someone made a post about graduating a year early so I already have a little bit of insight.

Incoming Research Assistant. Tips for finding roommates in Philly?
What's up guys, I'm graduating in May from Arizona State University and I was accepted for a 2-year research assistantship at Wharton. Do you guys have tips for finding a place and roommates? I'm looking to be as close to campus as possible but hoping to spend no more than $1200 on rent.

AP Credit
I’m an incoming freshman, and I was wondering if anyone here decided to cancel their AP tests after being admitted. I looked online and apparently I can only get credit if I get 5s on my exams (which I don’t feel capable of getting + for one of my exams, I cant get credit regardless of the score) so I was wondering if I’d have to contact the admissions office to ask if I’m allowed to cancel. Is cancelling the exams looked down upon? Will I get in trouble or something

business breadth outside concentration

Advanced Registration Ranking
I have a logistical question about class ranking: 

If I want to get into a class where the recitation carries the credit, does it make sense to request the recitations first, then put the lecture section all the way at the bottom since getting the recitation essentially secures my spot?

e.g.,

1. CIS-160-203 (1.00 cu)
   1. alt: CIS-160-207 (1.00 cu)
2. course
3. course

...

7. CIS-160-001 (0.00 cu)

&#x200B;

I hope that makes sense.

CIS 121 + CIS 262 Fall 2021 Semester
Hello, I am planning to take CIS 121, CIS 262,  EAS 203, some SS/H and some CIS 19x course most likely in the fall and I already know 121 should be fairly time consuming, which I am fine with. But will 262 added on to it be manageable with the new instructor Anindya De? From what I heard CIS 262's difficulty depends on the prof so for those of you who have heard/had him, is he good? Does he give reasonable work?

A Few Questions about Penn (Wildly Unrelated)
1) What is Penn culture like? Is it really as toxic as people say? Is it easy to make friends/network?


2) Does Penn’s submatriculation program increase your chance of getting into Penn Law School?

thanks!!

Uncoordinated Dual Degree?
So sorry to be that person. To be honest, I didn’t think I would do business until after I applied and I thought CAS would give me more flexibility for the things I was originally interested in (poly sci & public health) Looking back now, I wish I would have just applied to Wharton b/c it’s easier to get a dual degree coming from Wharton. 

How competitive is it to get an uncoordinated degree in CAS and Wharton, specifically political science and management? Do many people get rejected from their uncoordinated dual degree? Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you so much.

--------------------------------------------------
Inappropriate behavior from covid testing personnel
So I was saving up my saliva before going in to do the covid test like usual, and I guess I managed to save up an unusual amount. Basically I filled the tube a little too close to the top, so there was too much. They made me drink the extra off the top, and they chanted "Spit drinker, spit drinker!" at me. In all my life I've never felt so humiliated.

How do I tell if a job offer is fake?
I’m a sophomore international student and I recently received an offer to work for a large software company in the US. The company is headquartered in Germany but has large scale operations in the US. My recruiter is based in the Philippines and even though I’ve been interviewed by two people in the US (whose names and photos I’ve seen on the company’s website), I’m still a little suspicious because my recruiter is based in a very different country, uses emojis in emails, and my offer letter has a bunch of grammatical errors. Is there someone I can reach out to, in order to confirm if the job offer is genuine? I was thinking of Career Services but I’m not sure how much they could help.

Forgot to mention this earlier, but the company wanted the intern to start around 04/15, but they’re fine with me starting around 05/15, which also make me a little suspicious.

Placement exam to fulfill general education?

Sometimes I feel too poor to go to school here.
Sophomore here, right now in the middle of searching for somewhere to live for the fall. I receive full aid from Penn but always have to choose between comfort and ease versus price. For instance, part of me wants to live alone or with one other person but I can't afford 1000+ rent with utilities and anything below is hard to find or puts me walking home late at night in an unsafe position. My parents want me to be safe and I do too, but man is it hard to feel like I can really thrive here. It feels like I always have to compromise on everything. Do I choose to stay in Greek life and risk not having enough of an emergency fund, but lose out on friends? Do I not work full time during the summer to save up enough so I can actually have spare money through the year? Do I live alone as opposed to jumping through hoops to live with others? Is sticking myself in a house with 16 other people worth it for cheap rent and the added security of it all but sacrifice privacy, quiet, and having friends/my SO over? 

I swear some folks have it all and are able to do everything that their heart desires and that's fantastic, but man does it leave a sour taste in my mouth knowing how hard is it for me to even find a place to live much less anything else lavish here. 

Just a rant.

Music Ensembles at Penn
Hey! So I’m an incoming freshman at Penn and really want to audition for an ensemble or two! Other than the cultural ensembles (which I’m really excited about), I wanted to audition for the more classical ones like Penn Symphony/Wind Ensemble/Penn Flutes/Penn Chamber. Does anyone know how competitive these ensembles are as a flautist? Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated! 

Thanks :)

Cognitive Science and CIS (college cis) double major?

Dean’s List suspended again
Just got an email from the College about it. I sort of get why they did it, I know it’s not a huge deal and there’s gonna be a notation and all, but I can’t help but feel a little disappointed. I really worked hard and managed to up my grades this year :/
--------------------------------------------------
Need info about taking an incomplete
I have a family emergency and have had to fly back to my home state unexpectedly. My professor asked if I wanted to take an incomplete for the labs I will be missing and to finish them next semester. 

I was wondering if incompletes affect your gpa? I know if you don’t do the requirement it can, but if you fulfill the requirement will it be erased from your transcript and replaced with a grade? Will I get a normal grade that factors into my gpa after completing the requirements? 

I am worried to take her up on the offer if it could negatively affect me in the long run. I tried reading on the Penn website about taking an incomplete, but it was very unclear to me. Thanks a lot!

CIS 160 Graph Theory Help
Okay, so I am basically dying at the moment from 160. I felt extremely comfortable with the material from the first and second midterms but I got half an SD below the first one and half an SD above for the second one. For some reason, graph theory is not clicking for me and I am scared shitless for our midterm next week. Does anyone have any advice on how to do well on the final midterm??

Pre-health Postbac Academic Rigor / Competitiveness
I plan to be a career-changer med school student after completing a postbac program. I've been accepted to Penn, NYU, Fordham, Rosemont, and Rutgers postbac programs and wondering if the Penn program would really be more difficult to get excellent grades than the others. Any thoughts? The specific program is pre-health core studies - I haven't taken any science courses in college.

High Level vs Small Classes
This fall, I’ll be entering my junior year and I plan on going to graduate school (for history). The history classes next semester aren’t amazing, but I’m torn between taking a 300-level class (American Diplomatic History) or a 200-level class (Extreme Heat and White Nationalism). While I think the 300-level class would be more indicative of my ability to handle high-level coursework, it is a 90 person lecture, so the 200-level, 15 person seminar could be better for future letters of recommendation and the like. I’m equally interested in both courses if I’m being honest. I’ve already taken a 400-level course and did well in it, and after this semester I’ll have taken two 200-level courses as well. Just looking for some others who have more experience to weigh in! Thanks

Requesting Syllabus that's not listed on PiT from Prof. for Fall semester course?
I need to email a course's syllabus to the head of the Psych department to petition it as a cognate elective (as it's not listed as an option, but I believe that it will work for the major). The syllabus is not listed on PenninTouch, but I found the professor's email on Penn Course Review. Can I email the professor requesting the course syllabus? Otherwise, I guess I'd just send the petition without the syllabus. Thanks!

IR vs Econ
I’m very interested in both International Relations and Econ but due to other commitments, it’s not really feasible for me to pull off a double major, so I’ll probably end up majoring in one and minoring in the other. For the IR major I’m not really looking forward to the senior thesis, but on the other hand I’m slightly concerned with looking like a Wharton wannabe with an Econ major in regards to job prospects (feel free to let me know if this presumption is way off base). If any of you have any experience with either of these major/minor combos and wanted to provide some insight as to which you think is more rewarding that’d be awesome.

Apartment Question: How is 42nd and Chestnut? Is the cheaper rent worth how far it is?
Me and a few roommates are looking to move at one of the universitycityapartment buildings here, but our general concern given that we are all females is that it is quite farther than we would've hoped and the area does seem kind of barren (not a lot of stores/etc) that would make it feel somewhat safer. Since most of us do have late classes/work/are in greek life, we would love to not feel terrified walking home at night (We understand that we live in a city and we should expect to be cautious, but its just a general concern about things being a lot scarier than needed). 

On that note, rent here is very affordable for us and the amenities are amazing, but I'm genuinely considering living by myself or with one other roommate a lot closer to campus (right off Locust or near HamCo) for a bit more money, not as many amenities, but peace of mind. Not sure if safety here should be a huge priority or if I'm just scared for nothing about walking home at night and should take the cheaper option with the better utilities.

They do have one last unit in a closer location but with the cost of rent there, it would just make sense to either live alone right off campus since the costs come out to the same. I'm trying to hopefully negotiate down the price given that we are hoping to sign a two year lease!
--------------------------------------------------
Engineering Negotiations vs Wharton Negotiations
I was wondering if anyone had any insight as to the differences between these two courses (EAS 512 and OIDD 291). Both seem like good classes, but I'm wondering what I might gain more from. Additionally, has anyone ever managed to get OIDD 291 to count for the EENT minor in place of OIDD 291? Would love to hear people's thoughts.
--------------------------------------------------
MATH170 Difficulty
I'm thinking about taking MATH170 next semester, because I heard it was an easy class, and I just need to fulfill a requirement with it. The topics on the syllabus look kind of difficult, but I'm not too sure if it just seems that way. Anybody taken MATH170 and what are your thoughts on it?

Collaboration with nearby industries on applied projects (MSE DATS/CIS)
Hello, I was recently admitted to the MSE DATS program. At the risk of it sounding like a Penn vs. XYZ question, I'll limit some info because I have my heart set on Penn and I only want to know a few things about Philly. I'm currently deciding between the DATS program (I have a CS background and may even try to transfer to CIS, but I like how flexible and interdisciplinary DATS) and another program that is in a much larger city with a lot of industries and universities - and hence a lot of collaboration both within CS/ML but also with other industries like healthcare and finance. I am wondering what it would be like in Philly.

I wanted to know if there are enough opportunities to collaborate on applied projects with industries (kind of like Wharton's Analytics Accelerator - I can't rely on that because of the acceptance %). I realize NYC is quite close, but I don't know how it might play out during the semester. Afaik the PDSG is also helpful in this regard, but I am not sure if they have updated their website in a while so I'm unsure how often their collaborations happen. 

I am coming right out of my undergrad and would want to work with companies to get more of an idea of how I can apply my skills (of course there are internships, but I mean during the semester as well). I am also trying to pivot out of regular CS roles because I do not enjoy a lot of the software dev stuff and would want to explore the intersection between operations research/optimization/supply chain and ML/CS or perhaps tech consulting, and given that I don't have industry experience with these, it would really help to work with companies and try to solve problems.

Any info would be helpful!

Phi Beta Kappa Invite
Got a message from the college some days ago saying that I got into PBK but my name is not on the list on the college website when it got updated.

Sorry for the overly cynical post, but are math and cis shitshows for all 4 years at this school or is it just the intro classes you take for your first 2-4 semesters that are horrible?

Cis 545
Shot in the dark here and I probably should’ve asked this earlier but I have no idea what I’m doing on this last homework. Anyone in it that can help me out cause office hours are impossible to get into. The online format of this class is terrible and there’s very little help offered.

International student - working full time in the Fall semester?
I recently received an offer to work for a company in Boston for 7 months starting mid-May (upto December). I know that I can apply for CPT to work over the summer, but is there a way I can work full time over the Fall semester while maintaining active F-1 status? Something like a co-op where I don’t take classes and only work?
--------------------------------------------------
Good resources to study for CFA?
Anyone at Penn studying/ have studied for it and if so what do/did you use?  Seems like the resources recommended online are quite expensive (on top of the already expensive test fee) so not sure if its worth it at all.

When should I take CIS 121?
Hi,

I'm a current freshman at Penn and so far I'm hoping for a cis minor, but I'm not sure when would be the best time to take 121. Sophomore fall/spring will have fnce and acct, but junior year is recruiting... does anyone have any tips as to when to take 121?

(for reference, next sem I'm planning on taking fnce 100/acct 101/math 240/stat431 so I'm not sure whether to drop one or two of those and take 121, or wait to take it. I took 160 this past semester and am a bit worried about forgetting material if I decide to wait). Any tips would be appreciated, thank you so much! :)

Conflict between Neuroscience and Health and Societies
I'm a current pre-med and I am thinking of majoring in either Neuroscience or Health and Societies. I've heard from parents and cousins who already graduated college that a hard science major would be more useful for job prospects (like during my gap years). I absolutely love both majors but I am a bit more hesitant to take Health and Societies because it just seems like it wouldn't lead to as many job/position opportunities. I might be completely wrong though! Please let me know if you have any insight in this or if you know any benefits of either - thank you so much!!!

Program Transfer for Graduate Student
Hi UPenn Redditors

I am an incoming student for the CGGT program and I had applied for it since the curriculum interested me.
However, off late, due to some uncertainties regarding prospects after the program, I wanted to know if there would be a possibility for me to transfer out of CGGT and into CIS. I couldn't find anymore info or particular requirements for this on the website.

Any thoughts and suggestions are welcome.

P.S: Extra info - I am an International Student who worked as a Software Engineer for 2 years.

Wharton Math Requirements
Hey! I’m attending Penn next year and I was wondering if I would be able to hypothetically never take a math course during my time at Wharton. I have a 5 on BC Calculus, so the website says I would get credit for Math 104, the required math course. Would I be forced to take another math course instead? Also, do I need to take a test in addition to my AP credit to place out? 

Thanks for any input!

Where to submit financial aid forms
Hi, does anyone know where to submit the "Parent 2019 Federal income Tax Returns" and "Student 2019 Federal Income Tax Return"? 

I think it might be the online document submissions platform on penn srfs website, but I just wanted to check. 

Also, what exactly is "PROFILE Application" and "Electronic PROFILE Record from CSS"? 

I thought I just had to submit the CSS profile application, but there seems to be these two different requirements, so not sure what each of them is exactly referring to? 

Thank you so much guys!

Summer MATH 114 What to choose?
I was planning to take the first session (May-June) with Ziqi Fang. He has a 3.38 Instructor Quality on PennCourseReview, which is similar to what Rimmer has (for Math 114).

Did anyone have Ziqi Fang as a TA or instructor? How was it? Should I choose the second session (Rimmer's)?

FinAid Info?
Hi everyone, I'm currently applying as a transfer to Penn but am worried about my financial situation. It looks like Penn is need-blind, but that they consider all applicants to be **dependent** when applying to their traditional college. Unfortunately, I'm an independent student (over nineteen years old) and **haven't** received any financial support from my parents in the last two years (includes tuition, living, food, etc). I've had to live on an income of less than $20k last year. This is the problem: My parents live in a Canadian city where majority of the homes are worth 1.5+ million dollars cad, and because I've been told that I'm still considered a dependent student, I receive 0 financial aid based on the **estimate calculator** on the school's website. In the case that I am luckily admitted (which would be amazing), I'd have a $100k canadian annual cost (Penn's websites has $83k USD as total annual cost with no finAid), with an annual income of $20k, which scares the bejesus out of me.

Is there anything I can do, or will I have to accept full cost? In order to prove I'm an independent student, the school would most likely need proof like court documents, but I don't have any of these. Not every independent student goes to the courts or lawyers in order to leave home- some of us are just forced out once we come of age, and as a result don't have these docs.

I don't know. It looks like I will end up having to apply as a dependent and end up receiving 0 aid. **Any help from someone who has gone through this would be really appreciated.** What's the best course of action for me?

Application for Africana Studies Summer Institute
Hello, I'm an incoming freshman applying to the Africana Studies Summer Institute program, and was hoping to find someone here who could answer a question I have about this process.

The way the application is laid out, I cannot preview upcoming steps nor review/revise previous steps.

Some extra info: The course I want to use does not have a syllabus available yet, and I would have to email the syllabus to the psych department. Any suggestions? Do I just add the course anyway?

Good Luck Getting Your Vaccines

EDIT: 

Bad news - J&J is now paused everywhere.

Good news - Penn’s shortage doesn’t affect us anymore

How important are SS/H classes as an engineering student?
If I’m an engineering student, will potential companies care if I take only super easy SS/H classes?  How much do they look into these considering they’re not as relevant to a job in engineering?

Any advice would be appreciated, thank you!

also, i'm really nervous about orgo - i know it's a really hard class. if you've taken it before, can you share some of your experiences? how much time did you devote to the class per week? would you recommend taking a bit of a smaller course load that semester? how hard are the exams?

any advice would be awesome! ty!

Second semester sophomore pulling a 180 in life
Hi y'all

I'm a second semester sophomore in the college and I've been considering going into computer science.

I was hoping to hear some perspectives to see how I should go about this or if this is feasible at at all.

Same asswipe constantly harasses me through my window; what do
I live on the 1st floor and the only place I can put my desk is in view of the window. For the past week, this shitstain walks past my window and harasses me about 2-3 times a day for my sex, race, or both. I don't think he's a student. Can I report to Penn police? Can they even do anything? Should I do something else? Hasn't been threatening so far, but it's so f\*cking annoying and I'm worried one day he's gonna feel bold and try breaking in or sth. I really don't want to have to close the blinds, because living in a sunless room is just depressing, plus, it would be sad that I have to change my lifestyle because someone else is catcalling me.

Cheap housing including utilities around campus?
I'm wondering which places are well in budget (\~1100) for a studio AND include utilities. I've been finding great spots but none of the utilities aren't included and that would most certainly shoot me out of budget.

Where to look for advice?
Hi. I'm a current freshman, and while I do have some tentative subjects/majors that kinda interest me, I'm not really sure where to go from here. I tried to seek advice from pre-major advising but I can't access the page. Is there anywhere else I can seek advice from, or how I should seek advice? 

FYI the majors are cog sci, computer science (but I don't want to be a developer), marketing, economics, etc. I'm also in the college and I don't know what I want to do so I'm unsure if I want to transfer to Engineering or Wharton too... I'm wondering if anyone had similar experiences! Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------
Very confused freshman
I know that we can double count a foundational with a sector... and my major allows me to double count 2 courses toward the major requirement and sector. Can I use a course... say Math104... to fulfill major, sector, AND foundational? Is this triple counting allowed? I couldn’t find anything on the website....

CIS Sophomore Fall Class Schedule
Incoming CIS Sophomore. I've taken CIS120, 121, 160, and 262 and NETS150.

I got all A's Fall Semester and I'm doing alright this semester.

Do I take 240 and 320 together next semester? I'm thinking also of taking CIS197 Javascript and EAS203 and perhaps NETS212 as well. I might also take OIDD291 Negotiations if it's in-person.

I'm definitely tryna not kill myself next semester so let me know if CIS240, CIS320, CIS197, EAS203, NETS212, and OIDD291 is too much workload.

I'd be flexible with taking out CIS320 and replacing it with maybe a CIS 5xx class or something else.

Thanks in advance.

introvert experience @ penn?
hi! recent admit here trying to finalize their college decisions. I figured since this is a specific question I could post but if it’s not lmk I’ll take it down! 

I know that every school has extroverted and introverted people, but given penn’s reputation as the social ivy, I’m just concerned that I won’t fit in with the student body culture as someone who is pretty introverted. some current students have even told me that as an introvert I probably wouldn’t enjoy it here and that people are generally not friendly. honestly speaking to any introverts out there, is penn really a challenging place to be if I’m absolutely not a party person? I just don’t want to experience FOMO all the time :( 

also, on another note, what exactly gives penn it’s reputation as being a poor school for mental health? my other choices are also up on that list as being the worst schools for mental health, but as someone with anxiety issues I just want to know how to make my transition to penn easier should I commit (any mental health resources you particularly recommend?) 

thank you! Sorry if any of these are dumb questions. I’m on the edge of committing to penn but the social scene is just holding me back

Is there a Magic: the Gathering Club?
I've been looking for people in the area to play MtG with, but haven't really had success finding a group, especially with the pandemic. I was wondering if there were any official or unofficial groups affiliated with UPenn. 
I am a grad student, so I also don't really know if that limits my membership/participation! Thanks for any advice/help.

Is MUSC077 Offered Every Semester?
I'm interested in taking the class but I think it might be better to take MUSC070 before so that I have a good foundation? I also heard that it's a hard class to get unless you're a music major/minor and I'm taking a couple of music classes next semester to figure out my interests so that I can declare a music major or minor before signing up for the class. So I was wondering if MUSC077 (Intro to Electronic Music-making) is offered every semester, because I've seen that some music classes are not offered every semester.

Chem 101 vs Bio 101 during the summer
Which is harder, Chem 101 or Bio 101 during the summer? How much support do the prof/TAs provide? Which is easier to get an A in (exams, hours of study, workload, etc.)?  I am equally as good in both; I just need to fulfill major requirements.

Some questions about Penn and Penn Law's sense of identity and branding
Hi I was recently admitted as an undergrad and will probably attend and I have the following questions:

1. There seemed to be a crisis a year back when Penn Law changed their shorthand branding to just "Carey Law," but am I correct in that bc of the backlash they're going with Penn Law as the shorthand name again and the University of Pennsylvania Carey School of Law as the formal name? Kind of like how Northwestern uses Northwestern Law informally but NU Pritzker School of Law formally
2. What is the consensus of what to put in your Instagram bio if you're going to Penn? Is it "UPenn"? "Penn"? or tagging Penn's official Instagram? And more importantly what do we say in real life so that people don't think you go to Penn state? University of Pennsylvania is too long, UPenn might be ok, and Penn gets confused with Penn State all the time

Ik there's the whole ego thing and how you could see being confused w Penn State as a good thing bc it brings down the ego of Penn students but this has really been on mind recently
--------------------------------------------------
Rigor of CS curriculum in M&T
Recently admitted M&T student here, would be doing CS + entrepreneurship concentration. I was wondering what your guys impression of the rigor of CS here is compared to Stanford/Berkeley/MIT/etc? I'm very interested in cs and startups and have M&T as my first choice right now over MIT/Berkeley, because of the dual wharton degree and how I can apply that to my own startup plus how bright and close-knit the M&T peer group will be. However my parents are concerned I won't be getting the same level of CS education to excel in a software engineering job because Penn CS is "ranked lower" (i think it's pretty bs, and that you can get a similar education anywhere, but i'm just a HS student).

Is this notion true, am I sacrificing any quality of coding education by going to Penn over the "higher ranked" schools? Overall how rigorous is the program? Does M&T change this rigor/quality? Thanks!

OIDD 290 and PSYC 170 - Difficulty
So wanted to have insight on how difficult is OIDD 290 with Xuanming Su (haven't taken STAT 100 and am not the "mathiest" person but have heard the class is not that difficult). Also would love to hear about how difficult PSYC 170 is with Geoffrey Godwin (have only seen one opinion of him and its bad but Penn Course Review rates the difficulty at 2.52 so not sure). Again, I would appreciate any insight and thank you.

Housing question for grad students.
I’m thinking about renting out my house in West Philly and I’m curious to know what people think is an appropriate rent. It’s a pretty unique 1-bedroom row house near Clark Park. It’s in great shape with nice hardwood floors, a very large bedroom, a very nice bathroom with a large walk-in shower and a deep jetted tub. It has a washer and dryer in the basement, a small porch and a little patio in the back. Central AC, gas range. The kitchen is small and there’s no dishwasher, but the fridge and range are nice. Also considering renting it furnished with a big TV and a comfortable queen size bed. It would be great for a couple. It’s right by some good carry out places and a coffee shop. A nice short walk to campus.

Changing MS majors

For example changing from MS EE to MS embedded or MS robotics?

how do I make completely new friends oops
Hi! I'm admitted in the class of 2025 ED (very excited for the next four years). 

I'm not sure if I'm socially inept compared to others (I don't think so???), but when I've been reaching out to other incoming freshmen, it all feels kinda absurd and algorithmic sometimes - as if the entire conversation can be carried out by a bot if I just instructed them to 1. act very hyper + excited  2. bring up the same repetitive topics like intended major, boba trips, food, music, tv shows.  which i understand can be very interesting to some people but at the same time i feel really tired of having the same conversations on these random topics over and over and over again yknow? at the end of the conversation, i always feel as distant and strange as before we ever had it :(

I don't know if anyone else feels the same way, but at least to me it feels like everyone else is super outgoing and is totally thriving, so maybe I'm really just a big introvert?? but i do like talking to people so i don't know :(

I can't tell if 1. more ppl experience this sort of disillusionment 2. i just haven't found ppl i like yet 3. im doing this to myself by following the algorithm (but at the same time what else do you talk to about to strangers) 4. this is only an online problem and will go away in person

Does anyone have any advice on how to make nice friendships online? also if you'd like to be friends hmu :))

STEM rigor at penn
Hey everyone! I’m super lucky to have been admitted as an M&T student for the class of ‘25, but I can’t shake the feeling that I don’t belong. The M&Ts I’ve talked to all seem  to be set on business and Wharton. I haven’t talked to anyone who had SEAS as their second choice instead of Wharton. It’s really important to me that I get to spend a lot of time focusing on the STEM topics I love while in undergrad, including doing undergrad research in engineering.

My interests are in computational and synthetic biology. The three other schools I’m considering have very strong programs in stem (mit Stanford and caltech), and at all of them I’d be pursuing a double major in bioE and CS. Unfortunately, that doesn’t seem possible at penn because that would mean triple majoring. I heard M&T has flexible curriculum and I wouldn’t be opposed to staying an extra semester and taking a heavy course load, but a CS major still doesn’t seem feasible (correct me if I’m wrong). I’m thinking if I come here I’ll drop the CS major for a CS minor and concentrate in systems and synthetic biology. I know that penn has an incredibly strong bioE program (I looked at the curriculum, professors, and rankings and have come to the conclusion that all four of these schools have bioE departments that are comparable for my interests and that I would be very happy at). 

The main trade-off seems to be on the CS front. There are concentrations in bioE that are more on the computational side, but I really love CS in general and don’t want to limit my studies to its application to biology. I LOVE science and engineering. At caltech I’d be taking 12 terms of physics. Both caltech and mit have super rigorous science cores. That sounds SO FUN! At penn, I place out of almost every entry level science class. I wouldn’t take any physics classes at all.

I do want to go into biotech entrepreneurship, and so M&T seems like the obvious best choice on paper (especially because I could submatriculate into a Wharton mba), but others in my life have told me though that Stanford’s “startup culture” is a good compromise between the extreme rigor of mit/caltech and the business education at penn.

Other reasons I’m hesitant about M&T are that it’s far from home (I live in California) and moving across the country to a city where I don’t know anyone is scary. Also, the culture at penn seems very competitive — I’ve been reading some of the past threads where people asked about M&T and kept seeing comments about the prospective students “not being able to handle it.” I can’t shake the feeling that if I had asked this same question before getting in that current penn students would think I couldn’t make it at M&T. Now that I’ve been admitted, everyone is telling me that I can 100% handle it, but admissions offices aren’t perfect and I don’t want to blindly trust their instincts on my application that probably only got a 15 minute review.

I made a deal with myself to be 100% honest in my applications (so that I didn’t end up somewhere where I wasn’t a good fit), and I put in my application that I tend to thrive in collaborative environments. Obviously, I was admitted anyways. While I’m a competitive person and really enjoy hustling and giving my all to my endeavors (I assume that’s how I even got in), I’m also a 17 year old kid who loves her family and s/o on the west coast and is genuinely nervous about making the wrong choice and this transition in general. Will the penn community be supportive? It seems from this sub that being vulnerable and asking for help is viewed as weak, but this is Reddit and probably is not be fully representative.

I guess I just want to know if you guys think I’d fit in at penn and M&T, and if you think that I’d learn less in stem here than I would at other schools.

Four other kind of side questions:

1. How is LGBT support? I know this is a college and will be pretty liberal, but are most students accepting? I just wanna live my life without issues lol
2. How conservative is campus? As a moderate who leans pretty far left socially and decently far right economically, am I going to get shut down for voicing conservative opinions?
3. I was apparently invited to JWS which means doing research in Wharton I think (idk much about it) — will participating in this program make it harder for me to do stem research? Should I enroll in the program? 
4. Also for JWS, it says you live in a dorm with other people in the program. I also hear all the M&Ts live together? If I enroll in JWS and M&T where do I live lol

Any help is very welcome, especially from anyone who turned down the schools I’m considering for M&T. Feel free to pm me. Thank you so so much for reading all of this, and I really appreciate you guys hearing me out on this.

Edit: just a heads up I posted to the penn sub expecting yall to be biased towards penn and expecting you guys to make cases for penn. While any and all recommendations are appreciated, I did spend more time on my penn cons than my penn pros in this post (i am genuinely super confused and am not leaning towards or away from penn rn)

Should I join UPENN MS EE?
I received an admit from UPENN MS in EE and would like to follow the information and decision systems track. Course list: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bzlx9JXhaLJzU_L-y7i89flVexT98b2L/view?usp=drivesdk

I am interested in robotics and ai with a focus in healthcare robotics and autonomous cars. ( I have done projects in both)

I have certain questions I am hoping this community can help answer

1. How is the information and decision systems specialisation? Is the course list up to date? 

2. I am interested in Robotics, particularly controls and image. Are the companies around UPenn to apply for in these fields? 

3. I want to work at the grasp labs but saw names of very few ESE department students (particularly MS in ee or se) mentioned under professors who are affiliated to grasp lab. Is belonging to a different major a disadvantage (as it is meant for mainly robotics ms and phd)?

4.  Can I switch majors from Ms EE to Ms robotics after 1 sem? I heard switching majors in possible/easy in UPenn...

5.  If you had to choose between Ms ECE in UCSD, intelligent systems, robotics and control and Ms EE UPenn (hopefully information and decision systems), which would you choose? In terms of job opportunities, profs and courses for robotics and ai.

6. Which electives should I take to strengthen my robotics profile

7. There was a sudden decline in the ranking for UPenn EE in qs world ranking by subject. Similar drop is not visible in CS or MEAM. Do you have any idea why? Did professors leave?

Penn Statistics - which school?
From a friend, at Penn, I heard that I can major in Statistics either through Wharton or the school of arts and sciences - depending on if I want more of a business focus or more science. Is this correct? Also if I choose Wharton will my admission chance be much lower? Thanks!

Questions about the BFS program
I was recently accepted into UPenn and was also invited to apply to the BFS program. I really don’t know if I want more of a liberal arts education or if I want to focus specifically on my major and minor, so I have no idea if I’m gonna apply or not. I’m wondering if there are any major advantages of becoming a Ben Franklin Scholar other than the different approach to my education. Also, I would have to dorm in hill house, so how are those dorms? I’m planning on majoring in Econ and minoring in modern middle eastern studies if that matters at all.

What would you define the upenn atmosphere as?
Hello students and not-students of reddit!

I’m currently narrowing down my college list and I want to get insight into what colleges are like aside from what the college itself is putting out

So for current or graduated students of penn how would you define the atmosphere?

Also what would you say pros and cons are of the school, what is the social life like, student body culture, academic culture, how’s the food, dorms, teachers, etc

Also, I’d be applying for english most likely so I’d love to receive some information regarding that program as well

Even if you don’t respond but just choose to read this thank you very much

I’ll take any information you have!

CIS 160 homeworks are very badly written
Sure, I appreciate a good joke inside the question, but I stg it seems that the TAs are having too much fun with them. The HW questions are basically 80% useless story about dinosaurs or ducks or whatever the hell and 20% the question itself.

In every hw, I would discover that after an entire hour of being stuck on a question that I accidentally glimpsed over a crucial piece of information that will help me answer the  question. I would much prefer a problem set whose question go straight to the point over a qUiRky one where I have to spend a substantial amount of time just trying to decipher what the hell is actually going on.

What is Penn like?
Hey, I hope everything is having a lovely day! I am applying as a transfer student, entering as a junior hopefully graduating in 2023 with a BA in Sociology and Health & Societies. I have a few questions to ask regarding academics and social life.

* What is Penn's social life like particularly for transfer students? I am a first generation, BIPOC, and LGBTQ+, is there any support groups for BIPOC, LGBTQ+, and first generation students?
* Is the environment at Penn cut-throat?
* How difficulty it is academically for students studying Sociology and Health & Societies? Do you have any tips for Sociology students, especially for those who want to get into grad school or don't know what to do in life? 

Thank you so much for taking your time to read this post! Thank you very much!

Use this thread to post your reactions, anticipations, etc. **All other admissions/results/application posts will be deleted.**

A Q&A/FAQ thread for admitted students has been posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/ml2r10/official_admitted_student_faq_and_can_i_talk_to/), go there to ask your questions!

Good luck to all those waiting for their decisions!

**RESULTS ARE OUT!**

Congratulations to those accepted to Wharton and not-Wharton Penn! Opportunities to internally transfer are near!!!

In all seriousness, congrats to all those accepted. Huge accomplishment. To those not accepted, I'm truly deeply sorry. The College admissions process is bullshit and the amount of applications this year was staggering. As someone who didn't get into their first choice 12 years ago, I feel the pain and remember the tears. But I ended up where I needed to be in the end, and am so happy I got rejected way back when.

Also, to those who got waitlisted: I think the general advice is to look at other options as getting off the waitlist is difficult. But it is still possible: one of my best friends got off the waitlist just a few weeks before school started. Best of luck!

Can u take econ 101 while taking math 114?
Can u take econ 101 while taking math 114 together? I know math 114 is a prerequisite, so do you have to take math 114 before econ 101 or can you take it with math 114 in the same semester?

Thanks :)

GOOD LUCK FOR IVY DAY TOMORROW
Good luck to everyone who is applying to College and waiting to hear from the ivies tomorrow. You have all done an amazing job, especially during COVID, being studious and preparing long applications. Regardless of results tomorrow, remember that university decisions are always random and arbitrary and do not take away from your achievements and success. 

Your success in life is ultimately defined by your hard work and determination, not your alma mater. 

Godspeed

Small things you like about penn :)
Have been feeling really depressed over the past few weeks. I really like my friends and what I've been learning so far, but sometimes I just find it hard to get out of bed and keep grinding towards my goals. The end seems so far in the future and I feel really sucked into the imposter syndrome/duck syndrome environment of Penn. 

Just wanted to ask if you guys have any small things you like about Penn, whether that's the Bio pond or a certain food truck or even just a random part of campus. I want to be more grateful for where I am and also want to start enjoying the small things that bring happiness. Thank you!!

Biochem with Christianson
How much does this class rely on orgo -- mechanisms etc. Also how easy is it to get an A given that I do plan on devoting quite a bit of time to the class and going to TA/prof office hours? I'm deciding whether or not this class would be good in a schedule with two other STEM classes (phys 102 and a bio class). Thanks!

Does Penn give a tiny bit more preference to siblings?
my sibling is getting his decision tomorrow and I was just wondering whether Penn gives sibling preference? I've seen so many sibling pairs already at Penn so I have a little more hope haha

Does UPenn CIS/ECE consider PhD applications for the spring semester?
I'm currently doing my master's in the US and want to apply to PhD programs. I was wondering if it is possible to start in the spring semester if the advisor is okay with it even though the official deadline on the university's website means that only fall applications are considered.

Quaker Consortium: any experience with this?
Hello

I'm considering trying to take a course at Bryn Mawr, Haverford, or Swarthmore this fall. I think it could interesting and fun, a good way to meet people not at Penn. Also, academically, there are certain humanities fields where these schools are better than Penn. Has anyone done this before? If so, what was your experience?

FNCE 101 Honors - Is the App out?

Thank you!!!!

Summer Storage Options?
I’m a rising sophomore from Texas with a lot of stuff in my dorm room that I would like to keep for next year but also too much to ship/carry it all back home. I’m looking for good, cheap, storage options, preferably near campus that I can lease for the summer months. It’s worth adding that I’m looking for a relatively small space—I don’t have any big furtniture, just a lot of miscellaneous junk, some of which is too heavy and/or complicated to bring home. Any help goes a long way. Thank you!

How difficult is it to make the Penn Debate Society?
I’ve been debating since junior high and would love to continue debating at Penn next year - in particular in BP tournaments.

I know that PDS has tryouts but I was wondering how difficult it is to make the team. Like what is the ‘acceptance rate’, for example.

Thanks!

Do SPA electives double count with TBS requirements?

LPS Students?
Where the hell are you? Also, WHY ARE THERE ZERO SOCIAL EVENTS for non traditional students? Why is LPS so disorganized? Why do they think we don’t care about connecting with each other? What the hell?? Looking to connect with regular BA or MA LPS students.

hot Asian single in your area
😳😳😳
 
(yes, this is a friend thread)

**A bit about me:**

**Year:** Soph

**Major:** disappointment 

**Interests:** Costco, fashion (trying to get into it more), taking steamy showers, kpop/lofi beats, anything Disney/ATLA/Ghibli, thicc naps, anime (anxiously waiting for AOT S4 part 2)

**Pros of friending me:**

* I simp for all my friends 
* I’m a good listener (I’ve been told), and have ~good~ social awareness
* dad jokes (can be a con)
* I like to think that I’m open minded, and can always see both sides of the picture 
* Fast texter / I text back quickly (if I’m not asleep) ! 
* can be a low commitment friendship—not even on campus right now 🥲, but that can change next fall!

Updating the r/upenn "Can I speak to someone who..." List
Hey all.

Ivy decision day is just around the corner (Tuesday, April 6th), and with it will come a lot of prospective students with many questions about Penn. We also have many current students who ask questions about academic and cultural life at Penn. A few months ago, we developed the following list of r/upenn community members who indicated that they are happy to answer questions on specific topics, through DM or tagged comment. Today I want to update this list.

**If you want to be included in this list, please either PM me or comment below with the topics you want to be listed under (and if a topic doesn't exist yet, we can add it no problem). If you are on this list and want to be taken off it, please PM or comment as well.**

On Tuesday, we plan on doing what we normally do on RD decision day: one Celebration/Reaction thread, and one FAQ and Who can I contact thread (which will include this list). Any other ideas people may have for how we can welcome new Quakers, let me know.

Here's the list:

# People to reach out to by topic:

In  recent threads, these Penn community members have indicated that they  are happy to answer questions on specific topics. Feel free to tag them  in a question comment here or just PM them. **If  you are on this list and you want off, PM me. If you want to be added  to the list, comment below or PM me the topics you want to be listed  under (doesn't need to already exist).**

Thanks to all those who have agreed to be included in this list. I'm hopeful that this resource can be helpful to prospective and current students, especially now when campus visits and the campus experience has been affected by the pandemic.

I’m also hopping on the bandwagon, but hmu if you’re looking for a new friend!

Some of my interests: 
- I started binging kdramas since quarantine last year, and I can’t stop haha

Study Spaces on Campus
Are there places to study on campus that are open right now during the pandemic?
--------------------------------------------------
To ride the wave of people looking for friends
Some stuff about me: 
- Sophomore
- Cognitive Science/Linguistics double major (no idea what I wanna do with this yet, just think this stuff is cool)
- Night owl (my average bedtime is around 3am and getting up for morning classes physically pains me)
- Definitely an introvert (went to a party exactly 1 time my freshman year and did not enjoy it)

Some stuff I like: 
- Any and all crafts (knitting, crochet, embroidery, cross stitch and the like)
- Anime (mostly shounen, romcom, slice of life/comedy but will watch anything good)
- Food (especially Asian food)
- 2000s/early 2010s pop and JPop
- Skincare/makeup/nails (though I don’t wear makeup that often)

Feel free to shoot me a message :) I hope I didn’t write too much lol

MSE Systems Engineering
Hello, I have been recently admitted to the masters program in systems engineering and I was wondering if anyone had any information on the job placement after graduation? What is the reputation of the program or if anyone has any thoughts on it?
--------------------------------------------------
Any students who submatriculated (or have submatriculated) into any of the masters programs, willing to provide some guidance to an incoming freshman? Thanks so much!!

Senior Job Search
Any other seniors completely given up on coursework? All I can think about right now is applying to jobs. Coursework seems pointless. Please give me some words of encouragement so that I don’t completely flunk the semester.

Anybody take a class under prof. Anindya?
Has anybody taken a class under Professor Anindya De? They're the new CIS 262 professor this fall but I think they're a new instructor, there's no information on them whatsoever.
--------------------------------------------------
Forgot to select a room/dorm
Forgot to compete the process to get a dorm/room. Am I now at the mercy of the administration, and if so any tips on how to navigate this situation, especially if one gets placed in a 15K room instead of the lower cost option?
--------------------------------------------------
What do seniors not at Penn do on graduation day?
Seems like all we have is the live stream. Is there any way for us to participate or is Penn actually making graduation only for people on campus?
--------------------------------------------------
Is CHEM246 a pre-med requirement
Hey y'all, I was one of those boomers who took CHEM245 before it split into two (CHEM244 and CHEM249 nowadays) and I am just wondering if CHEM246 is also a pre-med req? 

Neither the old or the new version of the career services site mentions CHEM246 as a req, but since medical schools want "two-semester orgo with lab" which seems to suggest a two-semester lab sequence, I am wondering if CHEM246 is also required. Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------
Finals schedule
I’m a junior and I know that I should know this, but does anyone know when the schedule for final exams will come out?
--------------------------------------------------
Sansom Place for grad housing
Hi, I am coming to Penn this Fall and looking for housing. On-campus option provides places in Sansom Place East starting from $1200 (shared with other flatmate) if I want to have kitchen. Is this price reasonable compared to off-campus options as there are some cheaper places online but I have the whole apartment or studio but not sure if reliable or have hidden fee? New to Philly
--------------------------------------------------
Sophomore comp sci classes? (121, 240, 262)
So I head that 121, 240, and 262 are all pretty heavy courses. Would you recommend taking 121+240 in sophomore year fall and 262 the next spring, ore 121 + 162 this fall and 240 next semester? Also if I'm planning on taking a Physics intro class this fall too, would that be too much work? How did you plan your sophomore fall classes?

(BTW I already have credits for math 104, 114, cis 120 and cis 160 so these are some of my hardest remaining reqs)

\+ anybody have cis / nets elective recommendations?
--------------------------------------------------
do dining dollars carry over to next semester?
I saw on some '23 faq doc that extra swipes don't carry over but dining dollars do carry over? is this still true for fall 2021 given covid? also are they still doing that end-of-sem conversion from swipes to dining dollars?
--------------------------------------------------
Musicians? Artists? ANYONE
I've been struggling to find people with the same interests as me here at penn. Im a musician and artist (but a bio major and design minor)... I play the guitar, bass, and sing. I listen to tons of rock/alternative/indie/shoegaze/rnb music, and love going to concerts. Pre-covid I would attend at least one show a month ( I saw Cage the Elephant, Tyler the Creator, Rex Orange County, Cigarettes After Sex, Lush, Ride, the Walters, Courtney Barnett, Tame Impala etc). I also am a 2D artist (oil painting, color pencils, charcoals), but I want to get into more 3D work like ceramics soon.  

For the longest time I have wanted to start a band and was hoping that being here at Penn would allow me to do so,,, so if you or anyone you know is into rock/alternative/shoegaze or just anything I mentioned, pm me please... :)

Adding Dining Dollars
Hi so I’m a freshman in SAS and I have like $10 left on dining dollars with at least a hundred swipes left bc I prefer Houston Hall and Starbucks lol. Is this there any way to like exchange swipes for dollars or add on dollars?? I heard that it was possible once every semester but I don’t know if that applies to freshman or is even still true. 
Also what are the other ways to pay for food at Houston besides dining dollars?

Testing positive at home
Say I went home from the weekend. My sibling starts displaying symptoms and tests positive. I start feeling light symptoms two days later. Obviously I will quarantine. But do I go to campus to get tested so I can quarantine in Samson? Or can I test positive at home and stay home for 10 days and then show Penn my positive test as proof? I’d think the latter is safer. But if I do the latter, will I have to quarantine again for 10 days once I’m back? I want to quarantine but not do so twice unnecessarily. Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------
Best Sophomore dorms for extraverts?
I didn't feel like I got to meet many people this semester because of COVID and stuff, and I'm signing up alone for housing because I wanted the chance to meet new people. Does anyone have any suggestions for which dorms kind of fit that vibe?
--------------------------------------------------
Off Campus Senior, PO'd by Commencement Reqs
I decided to stay home in the west coast during fall 2020 and spring 2021 - didn't think it was worth paying housing for virtual classes.

Now I'm kinda steamed at Penn's current commencement requirements. Unless I stay two weeks (May 3-May 17) and use their testing, I'm not eligible. Outside testing isn't valid, and vaccination doesn't count either. 

Personally, this feels like it's less about health and transmission and more about red tape bullshit.

So yeah, looking forward to ending senior year on a sour note.

Roommate for NYC
Hello ! I think I'm early but - is anyone (females only please) moving to NYC this summer and looking for a roommate or two?

Vaccinations for intl students?
So I was wondering if any international students at Penn have gotten their vaccinations yet and if it's even possible? I'm arriving in the fall but my home country is putting off vaccinating "healthy 20 yr olds" (whether or not I'm actually healthy is questionable but) until like... August and I'm arriving on campus before my timeslot probably is. If anybody's gotten theirs or know someone who did, it'd be great to know about your experience.

Housing for Graduate Students?
Hey Reddit,

I’m looking for apartments in Philly right now, and I’m struggling to find any with reserved parking. I plan on going home once a month to visit my family, which is the only reason I want a car in the city. I also want to live close to campus so I can walk to and from my classes. Does anyone have any suggestions for places to live?

Also, is the on campus graduate housing worth it? Do they have options for reserved parking as well? Thanks!!

Tech Elective for CIS
For the 6 “technical elective courses” in the CIS BSE requirements, can we use any STEM course? In the 2017 requirements it says any stem course, but it doesn’t explicitly say that in 2020 (it says “rigorous/quantitative course with one non-trivial prereq”). 

Would something like chem102 or biol102 count?

Importance of PhD
How necessary is it to get a PhD? My parents are pressuring me to get one. I have some qualms about this.

1. What was the point of having my parents pay a shit ton to go to Penn if I was just gonna go to grad school. I could have done that from my state school.
2. I'm wasting like 4 years of making money while working on a PhD, and I don't even know if I will end up making more money after getting it.
3. I don't know if doing nothing but research all day is something I would like.

For reference, I'm a math/cs major, looking to either become a quant trader, or if that doesnt work out, go into tech like faang.

So what I'm asking is, how much will a PhD help me in my career prospects and is it worth pursuing?

Is there any on-campus employment that can be got asap and doesn't waste too much time?
I need on-campus employment to replace my social security card so that I can get the driver's license. It's quite urgent so I prefer to get the employment status ASAP. Also, I don't want to spend too much time on it. Is there any good choice? 

The only thing that comes to my mind is the grader in summer (?).

I feel like it’s worth it. But I have to ask anyway.
Hi! I’m new here, but I want to ask this question because I’m struggling with a decision. 

It’s almost time for me to make a graduate school decision. I want to work in higher education administration (program director, consulting, etc.) I’ve been accepted to Penn GSE and University of Maryland - both great schools but, of course, Penn is Penn. 

UMD offered an assistantship with a stipend and tuition coverage but because of the area I’d need to take out loans for rent - it’s a two year program so about ~$25-30k total. For Penn, it’s looking like $60-70k because they are not budging (so far) on any additional aid. So, I have to ask - is it worth it? I really want to attend but as someone who grew up low income, that much debt is scary...
--------------------------------------------------
shoutout to the guy who was following me and hit on me outside of 1920! fuck off!
shoutout to the guy who made me uncomfortable as FUCK by 1920 like 30 minutes ago while I was just trying to take a walk. did quarantine make y’all forget common decency? he was creeping on me while going for a run and would slow down to walk next to me then run ahead and then stop to “stretch” and “tie his shoe” so I would pass him and he could stare at my ass then ran up to me and told me I look “reaaaally good” while making eyes at my hips. and then he just kept running and ran away! how long is it going to take for it to get into your heads that it’s just NOT appropriate to walk up to a stranger and comment on their body? it’s predatory and unwanted. I’m already having a shit day and like the last thing I need is a guy following me and hitting on me while I’m minding my fucking business. ITS NOT ROMANTIC TO FOLLOW A WOMAN. 

Like this shit happens on the street REGULARLY like the amount of times I’ve been cat called at night just waking from acme to my dorm and it doesn’t matter what I’m wearing I’ll have my hair hidden, mask on, knee length jacket, wide leg pants, face down. I’ve even been FLASHED by some old dude while walking a block past acme. Also I’m realizing half of our male classmates don’t even realize this shit is happening.

it’s just a whole different level when it’s clearly a penn student and it’s on campus. I thought I could expect a little bit more, u know? do better men.

Penn students build app that lets you have instant 1:1 convos about anything
Hey everyone!

Wanted to share a project that some fellow seniors and I have been working on called [Beehive](https://www.askbeehive.com). Our app lets you have instant 1:1 phone conversations about any topic, such as a project you're working on, something interesting happening in the world, or life and career advice. 

To use Beehive, you post your topic, set an expiry time of 5 - 30 mins, and wait for someone else to give you a call. While you wait, you can browse and answer other posts to build your stats, follow your friends, and check out different categories.

Building meaningful connections online is hard, made only more difficult by the pandemic. r/Upenn has been an incredibly engaging community during our time at Penn, and we wanted to figure out a way to add a new dimension to our online experience by bringing in voice. 

We’re excited to see how this community uses Beehive and to hear your thoughts on the app. **To join, put** `@beehive_social` **as the user who invited you.** And if you like what we're building, we'd love for you to invite your friends to join too. Looking forward to your questions and feedback!
