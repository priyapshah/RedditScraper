Switching Co-op cycles
Is it complicated to switch up your Co-op cycle from fall to spring. I recently met with my advisor and they told me that I was set to have my first Co-op in the fall of 2022, but would much rather go on co-op in the spring. I'm in the business school so I know it's a bit harder to switch it up. Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to talk to my advisor about this?

mission hill free parking
I have a friend who needs to park for a couple hours on the hill and I don't have a car so I'm not familiar with any of the parking spaces. I saw this post about it but is it still right? [https://www.reddit.com/r/NEU/comments/ifi7lm/parking\_on\_mission\_hill/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NEU/comments/ifi7lm/parking_on_mission_hill/) The post said that parker hill has free overnight parking, does that mean after like 6pm you can park there as long as you want for that night?

Information systems vs computer science vs data science
Hi all I am a fall 2022 aspirant and I would like to change my major from Electrical engg to cs or ds or mis.

My question is what is the difference between those three majors?

As far as I have seen at official website cs is more towards specialized topics like theory of computation, machine learning, networks etc.

Ds is more into math and machine learning along with some cs courses.

Information systems is more abt IT management and more on application side

Which of these does the co op recruiters look more into and can I do software engg job if choose ds or is?

Grad school campus confusion
Hello everyone,

I got admitted to NEU for MCS, Fall 2021. I was majorly delighted until I heard that it was the Portland, ME campus. Since it's so new, it is currently one floor of a sublet-ted retail headquarter building. I wasn't too hyped about that, so I emailed the grad admissions team, asking if deferring my admission to Fall 2022 will give me a place at the Boston campus. 

One question has been nagging me: is it worth deferring, or should I just take the current offer? I can also be transferred to the Silicon Valley or Vancouver campuses for Fall 2021. Should I just pick one of these, or wait for Fall 2022?

OSSCR Plagiarism hearing
Hey

So I recently got rekt for copying in the final and the prof said he'd be reporting me to OSSCR. This is my first offense so I'm not really sure what I should be expecting in terms of the repercussions. Reading through the various threads on this subreddit, it seems like it could be anything from just getting a 0 for the test or a straight up suspension. 

How worried should I be? Before you point it out, yes, very stupid decision making on my part!

Prospective graduate student
As a prospective graduate student, is majoring in biochemistry at Northeastern a good idea? Or is the course load too stressful and demanding that it would negatively impact how I look toward graduate schools? If so, what other majors should I consider? 

Also, if I want to graduate in 4 years, would you recommend me taking 2 co-ops or do a bunch of research at Northeastern instead? Thanks!

Choosing between Rutgers Honors, PSU, and NEU for Physics Major
I’m very fortunate to have parents that are willing to help me out with my tuition. In fact they have saved 200k for all education. Whatever I don’t use for undergrad I can use for my masters (or put towards a house). I want to make sure I know what I’m getting into to justify the price.

Pros to Rutgers
Close to home (50 minutes)
Cheapest (26k a year; 105k total)
Good social scene (I’m somewhat into going out and partying) 
Both my parents went there
Close to Philly and NYC (for entertainment and for jobs)
Good alumni network

Cons
I didn’t love the vibe when I went there
Less academically rigorous than the other two
Rutgers NB is spread out over a bunch of campuses
Prestige and co-op program is lower than NEU
Huge classes/ not personal connection with professors


Pros to NEU
Boston is an awesome city with plenty of big tech companies right there
Co op program is great and I’d love to have some experience under my belt/ build my resume/ have my education built towards work
Enjoyed the campus and energy there. It felt like everyone was working towards something.
I’ve heard 2 co ops would pay ~25k
Job right out of college

Cons
Price is 61k (245k)
Worried that with different co ops and study abroad opportunities it would be more difficult to make friends
Less of a social scene
No money for grad
Quite a hike to get to Boston (5 hours)
Not strong alumni network

Pros to PSU
Academically stronger than Rutgers for Physics
Love the campus and vibe there
I feel excited about the prospect of going there
Awesome social scene
Great alumni network
Could possibly change to instate although I haven’t looked into that too much 
2 of ny best friends are going

Cons to PSU
47k a year; 190 total
Not in honors for first year but will apply following year (didn’t apply)
Big classes 
3 hours away

Although my parents keep telling me that I should care less about the price, I can’t help but wonder is NEU 140k better than Rutgers and 50k better than PSU? The biggest pro to NEU is that I don’t know what I want to do yet and I feel that would be the best place to really be able to figure that out through co ops.

Any responses are much appreciated. Thanks!

TW // mention of eating disorders



This past year has been really rough for me, and I’m pretty sure many can relate. I have had to battle an eating disorder, body dysmorphia, and other mental issues. I was not able to have a full senior year, and college application season was very stressful.

I applied to northeastern as a fluke honestly. I saw that they had given me an application fee waiver, so I applied in December regular decision. I had applied to 10 other schools and my top school at the time was umd college park (idk why lol.. I'm literally from Texas). I did not think I had a chance at all of getting in at the time. 

Months later, I was accepted into umd college park and planned on going. This all changed when I got my decision letter from northeastern. I couldn’t believe it. I had been accepted w/ honors and a merit scholarship. Still, the cost was hefty. I applied for financial aid (probably the most stressful process in my life), and because Maryland gave me no money, I was really gunning on northeastern giving me enough to go. 

I visited the campus last week and fell in love. It was absolutely perfect. And that same day, I got my financial aid package... and they met my FULL FINANCIAL NEED. The next day, I committed while on the Amtrak to go back for a flight home to Texas. 

Although this year has been stressful beyond belief, I feel like in some way, at least for me, it was worth it. I just feel absolutely lucky and that everything I have been through all of high school was worth it. I am proud to say that I am northeastern bound and can’t wait to be in Boston for the fall!!!!

Please help! Is the Information Systems program at NEU worth it?
Hi! I recently got an admit in the college of engineering northeastern University Information Systems (Masters) program. I have seen the courses they are okay but still wanted a review regarding the program . Many say its just a Cash Grab course and i have also seen that each year COE comes up with a new program just by mixing different subjects of different majors. is this true?

Thanks

Is Northeastern worth the debt?
Hello, you may be questioning this question just like I did last year. The answer is that Northeastern may be worth the debt if you enjoy NUGGS. I am going to watch the graduation ceremony commence atop a stack of NUGGS boxes in Centennial like Yertle the Turtle. If you are looking for an excess amount of NUGGS boxes to do the same, I hear they are \*chef's kiss\* from Wally's. You can use the store locator to find a nearby Wally's. If anyone would like to sit atop my tower with me, it will cost you 15$, although that 15$ will allow you to bring two of your favorite parents, rather than just one at the official ceremony. Masks will sadly be required atop Yertle's tower, but safety is our number one priority.
--------------------------------------------------
PSA to incoming students who are thinking of asking whether NEU is worth the debt
the answer is no it’s not, no school is worth 100k+ in debt and neither is northeastern. i understand it differs in some cases like if you’d only be in 10-25k in debt or something over the four years which is a little more reasonable. but if you have the option of going to pretty much any other college without having to take out loans, go for it. 

especially with the mindset most incoming students are in i understand that it can be hard to think about going to a different school especially if northeastern is one of your favorite options. but i promise college is about what you make of it and even if you go to your state school you’re gonna end up enjoying it and having a great time anyway AND without $100k+ in debt that you will hate having to pay off later on. 

there’s very little “pros and cons” about any school that justifies a ton of debt/loans. and i’m assuming in most cases that debt/loans are on top of what your parents are already going to be paying. so save yourself the time and them the worry and expense of having to pay an insane amount for a college education you can elsewhere for much cheaper. 

i know it sucks and i definitely recommend appealing if you are able to but i promise you, no college is worth 50k+ in debt, even with the co-ops. and this is also what most people will reply with so instead of making another post about your situation, if you just look at everyone else’s post (because there’s a LOT) the answers are most likely going to be applicable to your situation as well. 

I’m just posting this because there have been so many posts asking about whether or not it’s worth the debt but the answer is the same in most situations and they’re usually basically the same situations and unless your debt is in the 0-25k range (and even then a lot of the schools you guys are comparing to northeastern to with a lot less debt are great schools and you wouldn’t miss out on much by choosing them over northeastern), northeastern is not worth it. i promise you, financially crippling yourself to go to northeastern is NOT worth it. 

sorry for the long post, and i don’t want to shut down you incoming students from posting questions, i get it, it can be really confusing and overwhelming when you’re not even in college yet, but please just read other people’s posts sometimes, like most people don’t mind answering the same question a few times but when you’re able to find the answer on the same reddit just by searching up “debt” or something, and reading the hundreds of posts other kids have posted, it just gets annoying. you guys can also find your answer much faster that way since it’s already been answered. so do some research first (there’s even a megathread for incoming students filled with questions that have already been answered) you’ll most likely find your answers much faster that way anyway.

is NEU worth debt?
hi,

i've been admitted into NEU and i have really been struggling to decide if i should go here or NC state. (yes it's may 1 😜)

tl;dr i love NEU so much - but i would be 90-120k more in debt.
nc state is an okay school and i would be $0 in debt, but would still have to pay a lot out of pocket

i am an out of state resident for both colleges, but for personal reasons i will not be attending my state schools despite it being much cheaper. i have narrowed it down to nc state and neu. 

i will be majoring in engineering (currently undeclared for both but leaning toward biomedical engineering/chemical engineering)

neu pros:

-diversity and inclusion: i am a vietnamese american student - diversity is so important to me and i know that i will find it at neu and be much happier. i come from a city that is not diverse at all, and in 15 years of living here, i have only had one vietnamese friend. i struggled a lot w disconnect from my culture and idk i would just love to have more friends like me.
(don't get me wrong, i know will find friends at nc state too, but it would be really nice to find more people that are like me.) <boston is 6.2% viet while raleigh is 0.7% viet; neu is ~16% asian while nc state is ~7%) 

-co-op program: i'm sure u guys have heard enough about this haha (apparently this + other things really help out your resume)

-better education/ranking ! higher ranking for engineering and i have heard good things about it

-i have read things online about NEU and it sounds like they are very focused on helping you find your major / career path, which i have been struggling with. i have no idea what to do in the future and the many one-on-one advisor meetings sound very helpful

-prestige: it isn't as important of a factor but it still would be great to be able to tell people that i go to neu lol

-better dorms than NC state

-literally my favorite campus, i can not get over it and the thought of going there makes me so happy

-not as important but when i toured neu, a tour guide told me about the "RedEye" bus, which drives from sometime late ? to 6 am to housing so that we can stay up and study late in the library and not have to walk back to our dorms. it sounds like something that i would use a lot due to my studying habits

-i was also accepted to NU in. boston, and it sounds like a great experience / the first 6 months of having to use the metro etc and being right in the city will help me acclimate much better to the new environment. also i think gpa doesn't count for my first semester? but i think it'll be more of a benefit so it's less to worry about after moving and everything. also, i will be able to apply for housing later on for my second sem and i could potentially get better housing than the first year dorms !!

-it will also be more fun for family to visit (but more expensive) 

-top 2? liberal colleges (i think i read it on niche). i am very left leaning and i would also love to surround myself with people who have a similar mindset.

-i am also not really into partying / drinking or anything etc so party life isn't important !

-omg i also love the circle on campus and all the hammocks everywhere. my mind keeps going to that . stop this did not deserve its own bullet point

-i want a fresh start, and it feels like this is the perfect place to. 

cons :( :

-i will be paying ~67k a year for all costs, including scholarships etc. so that amounts to $268k. in comparison, i will be paying $122k at nc state. fortunately, my father will be able to help me with part of the costs . essentially, everything left over (for neu) will be about $120k in loans. i am planning on doing co-ops, and i estimate that i will be able to pay for $30k of it total in 4 years (please lmk if this is off, i calculated it based on average hourly/monthly co-op salary from reddit - how much i'd have to pay for housing/food). so about 90k in loans. 

-i am not exactly sure what i am going to do after undergrad. if i go to grad school, it will still just add onto my debt. if i decide not to, then perhaps paying off the loans wouldn't be too bad, but it seems like such a big decision to make now

-obviously the classes would be a bit harder, taking up more time ! but as long as most of the students are in the same boat, i'll be fine :)

-it seems a little daunting at first to move all the way to boston; it's a very big lifestyle change and it makes me nervous to think about. however, it seems like a lot of the students are in the same place as me, especially the students also in nu in boston. it seems like jt would be easier to make friends there.

-for engineering, i will have to purchase a $1.1-1.9k laptop (windows)- i was planning on buying a new one for school anyways, but i really wanted to get another macbook (please dont attack me i love them !!) and i was looking forward to getting another for so long (i've had mine for 5.5 years and it's hanging by a thread). the good thing is, is that if i buy a laptop through the school, then i will have a 4 year warranty on it. (i have a windows desktop, but i much prefer to use macbook for schoolwork. it just feels more responsive and i have more options for organization)

-i have heard stories of more pretentious people coming here because they are more financially well-off, but i don't make assumptions of people before i meet them (but feel free to clarify !)

-i wouldn't be able to bring my car, but i also don't mind taking the metro everywhere

ok 

nc state pros:
-$122k total for 4 years - i know this shouldn't really be a pro, but my dad has talked to me about it and he will be able to pay all of it off. basically, i'd be $0 in debt and i would not have to take out any loans. again i know it would be much cheaper to go to a state school, but the option is off the table for various reasons.

-the first year is more expensive because i'm out of state, but each year after is 25k for all costs, which already sounds more bearable.

-they still have a good engineering program (top 50) and are a top 20 university? it's been a while since i've done research

-it will be an easier move and lower cost of living, and i can spend a little more / do more things + won't have to actively worry about being in debt

-i would also be able to bring my car - i love driving !!! it'll be one of the things i miss the most if i go to boston. 

-i have 2 friends going there, so i will still be able to get the fresh start i wanted but i won't actually be alone.

-school spirit ! i didn't see much at neu in comparison to nc state, but this isn't a huge factor to me

-i presume the workload would be much less than neu which gives me more time to myself, (but honestly, thinking about it i wouldn't care if there is more work and if i'm in boston :'( )

-closer to home, easier for family to visit 

-i really like this campus too ! but not in comparison to neu </333 

-the study abroad opportunities sound great, and i would not have the weight of my possible future debt over me as i travel and spend money or just attend college in general.

cons:
-the population - i don't love large schools and a large student to faculty ratio would not be that great for me. i dislike the idea of having large classes and i feel like i would perform academically worse? like i would have less motivation - (idk how to word this and it initially came off badly) but overall i think i will be fine at nc state because i am smart ! :D

-i heard that the dorms suck, but i might be able to fill out a housing exemption due to some personal reasons (but if it gets denied, then this will be a very big con. i don't really have time to decide after i hear back about my housing exemption)

-it will also be harder to find a roommate off campus, and i would preferably like to also live with a first year but it seems unlikely due to the lack of time that i have, given that i am allowed to stay off campus. 

-partying: again, i don't really love the idea of it, and i don't necessarily want to be around it. the campus is big though so i know i wouldn't have to always be around it, but it seems like a higher possibility if i'm required to live on campus. 

-it's in north carolina - i love city life soo much and i can't help but compare raleigh and boston. raleigh is fine, but i feel like most of nc will feel like my hometown (mostly white, a bit racist, unaccepting !) it is very pretty though but i would find what i am looking for at boston.

-lack of diversity. there is a vsa / asa, but i don't know. i just love the idea of being able to make friends that are like me without actively seeking to? im not sure how else to word it but i hope it makes sense. this is really important to me but i think i will still be able to make viet friends at the end of the day

-not as prestigious? again not as important of a factor but i can't help but feel like i am settling .. it isn't nc state itself, but i know that the opportunity to go to neu is much slimmer than nc state and idk . i know if i went to nc state, the first year would be easier on me, but after i feel like i'd start to regret not taking the opportunity. i dwell on things much longer than i should, and the thought of not going to neu has been bothering me and i already feel regret and i haven't even made a decision yet !

at the end of the day, i feel like i would be happy going to either school but just . much happier at one over another. (or do i just really like the idea of it now??) but i just can't tell if the debt is worth it or not.

i also have attempted to appeal my financial aid to both schools and it was rejected.! 

it is always an option to transfer schools (neu said they would "welcome me back as a transfer applicant" if i did decide to go to another school that was better for my financial situation), but i really dislike the idea of transferring schools. i feel like if there is any time to move to boston, it would be now, because everyone else is in the same spot as i am - unfamiliar w the area and looking for new friends. i think transferring back after a year or 2 would be difficult to integrate and it wouldn't really relieve much of the cost.
 
i have gone back and forth telling myself that i don't want to be in debt and it is a much better long term investment to go to nc state, but i also keep telling myself that it'll be okay if i do go to neu and i would be able to pay it off later or within 4 years i'll win the lottery or become famous and rich or something (this is a joke . but unless). i just don't want my reluctance to be in debt to hold me back from the best opportunities. but i don't want it to be x years down the road and me regretting that either. i also tell myself it's just undergrad, but i have resented the place i was living for so long and boston just seems like . perfect. (but nc will be fine too because i won't know most people there  !) ig i'm just weighing my relative happiness between each schools and seeing if it is worth that much money over 4 years.

omg sorry this was so long but i would really appreciate any feedback :) ! 
typing this out was honestly very therapeutic and i can go back to sleep now lol thank u!!

Is NEU worth 54k/yr?
Hey everyone, I'm a prospective student and I'm incredibly torn between NEU (cs + bns major) and VT (cs major, instate tuition). There's around a 25k/yr difference, but I've fallen in love with NEU + the Boston area. I guess I kinda need a reality check on whether this difference would actually be worth it for NEU, thank you guys so much in advance!

For a little context, I have interests in bio and business and have plans to pursue an MBA after undergrad.

NEU Pros:

* Boston is excellent in terms of opportunities for forming connections and networking
* Co-op program could give me a significant advantage entering the job market (especially for CS)
* Honors (6k for abroad experiences sounds amazing)
* Social scene of Boston/just a lot of things to do in Boston
* Doesn't have too many people from my area, could force me to come out of my shell a bit
* Pretty well rounded school (not solely focused on STEM)

NEU Cons:

* \~54k/yr is a lot :')
* Pretty difficult to graduate within 4 years (with minimal summer classes)
* A super long drive from home, parents are kinda worried about that
* To my understanding, not as well known for CS (at least where I'm from)

 

VT Pros:

* In state tuition! Puts cost at around 28k/yr, and makes it my most affordable option
   * Allows me to shoot for more expensive programs for grad school (MBA)
* It's pretty good for CS! Definitely has a name for itself
* HUGE sense of school spirit
* Can graduate at least a semester early pretty easily
* Honors

VT Cons:

* Not that well rounded (super focused on STEM, I'd love to still have a solid foundation in humanities)
* Kind of in the middle of nowhere, not much to do except outdoorsy things (I'm not an outdoorsy person at all)
   * I'm also worried that this means it'll be harder to land a good internship/make industry connections
* From what I heard, a big party school and is pretty big on Greek life (not very interested in either)
* CS is in the Engineering school, has a bunch of engineering reqs that I'm not really interested in
* Not much of a change of pace in terms of people (a lot of kids from my area go to VTech as well)
* Kinda far away from home

Graduation ticket scam PSA
I made a post yesterday seeking a graduation ticket, and was stupid enough to get scammed out of $100.  
Learn from my mistake: don't send money to andm63161@gmail.com through Paypal, or pay anyone unless they can prove that they actually have a ticket  to  sell to you.
Please be careful of scammers everyone.

How will co-op go😭
I am planning to do co-op in software development in spring 2022. I am a transfer student so have only finished fundies 1 & 2 so far with a C in both. Have no practical experience in the CS field (have designing and social media content creation experience tho). I didn’t know I had to apply to internships in December/January in the US (international student) so I don’t have internships for the summer but I’m taking classes both summer 1&2.

I had a lot of questions questions:

1. When should I start applying for co-ops?
2. Besides the NEU website (don’t remember what it’s called) which are website you guys have successfully found co-ops on?
3. Will I get a good enough co-op?
4. What are things I can go to gain practical experience in the CS field. 
5. Can I get an internship in software development now, if not for immediately for the latter part of the summer?
6. What kind of individual projects can I do? I know the basic concept but I have no idea what kind of projects do people do so don’t know where to start. 

Sorry for the abundant questions, and thanks guys for your support and advise:)

Did you guys send in your ap scores from senior year?
I’m an incoming freshmen so sorry if these kinds of posts aren’t allowed or something. But I really don’t think I’m going to pass my ap exams this year and my ED agreement said I can’t get below a C in any of my classes or “an equivalent grade on a national exam”. So is that clause just for national exams in other countries or do they mean you can’t get below a 3 on ap exams? im scared they’ll be suspicious of me not sending scores even though the ap classes are on my transcript and I’ve gotten As and Bs in them.

Is the Architecture program always 5 years?
I know there’s a mega thread for questions but I’m not sure if this fit well there. I’m ready to commit to Northeastern in the Explore program and might want to study architecture, but I saw that the sample schedules are always 5 years. Do you know if it’s always 5 years, or if it’s possible to complete the degree in 4? And how would it be switching co op cycles in architecture? Thanks.

College Decisions
I am having a difficult time deciding between Northeastern and NC State to save money. I live in NC and if I go to NC State I would go into practically 0 debt, however I would transfer to unc. I got into Northeastern with a Dean's scholarship and grants and my debt would probably be around 30-35k total (I am waiting on a financial aid appeal response based on change in financial circumstance). NEU is p much my dream school but im wondering if I should just try not to go into any debt.

Edit: I might go to grad school for my masters, but not sure rn/might be later (not med school or anything)
My major is a health science and business administration
Also, $14k of whatever loans I take out (may it be 25k or 35k or 45k-max) will be subsidized loans.

Prospective Undergraduate Bioengineering Student Deciding Between Northeastern and Georgia Tech
Hi r/NEU, I'm currently deciding between Northeastern and Georgia Tech as a BioE major, and I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions or could help me decide haha.

Intended major: Bioengineering/Biomedical

A little context: I'm really interested in pursuing stem cell and IPSC research. I also plan to go for an PhD following my undergraduate experience, so a good research experience and hopefully some industry research experience would be helpful.

**Northeastern**

NeU Pros:

* Located in Boston, which is literally one of my favorite places in the US
* Boston is amazing for biomedical research and biotech
* Great co-op program
* More well-rounded in majors and in the humanities
* I have friends at NeU and in Boston in general

NeU Cons:

* Still pretty expensive more expensive option (43k/yr)
* Bio-E program is not as highly ranked or recognized. The program was just established 6 years ago, so really it's new
* Weaker program (my sister did bio-e at NeU and said that she did not think the program taught her well, she said she felt like a "jack of all trades, master of none")
* Most Bio-E majors I have known from NeU have either switched to mechE or chemE, or they are pursuing a med-track, which is something I do not want

Thank you so much for your help!

**Georgia Tech**

GT Pros:

* \#2 BME program in the country, has a lot of name recognition, well established
* Well funded, great research school
* One of the largest co-op/internship programs in the country, great alumni network
* Student body is really motivated and really pushing the envelope in engineering
* Beautiful campus, right next to central Atlanta, but still secluded
* I got accepted in the Honors Program as well, so I think that gives generally better housing and more mental wellness opportunities (lol)
* I think GT has better placement in grad programs and even in industry, based on its connections to Emory and its own grad BME program

GT Cons:

* A lot more stressful and difficult than NeU. I'm not sure how this will impact me applying to grad school due to a potential drop in GPA
* I do not know Atlanta. This is probably the most scary thing, because I live in the Northeast, so I'm not sure what to expect
* Not as well rounded as NeU, it's tech-focused school and I'd love to have more of a basis in some humanities
* Food isn't good (only applies to freshman year), housing is okay, and of course the infamous "60-40" gender ratio
* Slightly more expensive option (51k/yr)
* BME seems to be more "mechanics" focused than on biology

Paid Undergrad Research?
I just got offered an undergraduate lab position where I'm doing genuine research (not just cleaning up or making solutions), as a rising second-year. The offer is full-time Summer 2, part time 16hrs during both semesters 2021-22, and even extending into the next summer full-time. I just received the e-mail with the offer, but there was no mention of pay. How can I politely ask the prof if this is a position that could be hourly, or come with a stipend? I really want to do this work, but I'm not sure I can swing it if it's completely unpaid. 

Any suggestions for phrasing an email reply accepting the position with all due gratitude, but asking about pay? Thanks!!

Transfer Students (Fall and Spring)
Lol so apparently some people might not even be able to get off the waitlist cause so many seniors applied to Northeastern University. I also noticed that they extended their transfer application deadline to June 1st. I came on here and saw that apparently the reason was that there may not be enough transfer applications. Now im second guessing that, because I think there might have been so many that they needed to push it back? How likely is it that there may be limited spots available for fall transfer students, let alone spring transfers? I'm really worried because I would love to attend NEU in the spring.

Questions about majors (Transfer Student)
Hi! I am planning on transferring to NEU for the spring, and I have a few questions about the combined major and minors. I really want a combination of Computer Science, Biomedical Engineering, and lastly Animation/Media Art (Something along those lines). I initially decided on a combined major of CS and BME, and a minor in computer engineering and animation. I would also really be open to the CS and CE combined major, and then minor in BME and animation. I know my course load would be super heavy, but I will put in the work.

N.U.in Boston vs. UW
Hi there! I've been stressing out about choosing between N.U.in Boston and UW...

For N.U.in Boston I would be going into Computer Science+Computer Engineering, and UW would be pre-sciences. I am really uncertain about either because I've heard a lot of different stories for both––the harsh Covid restrictions and very two-sided views regarding the N.U.in Boston Program and the severe competition to get your major at UW. Imo, both schools have a pretty good reputation  and also have great internships/co-ops. 

I was wondering if anyone had anything to share about their N.U.in Boston Program experience, especially about the courses, living conditions, and the integration into the main campus afterwards (maybe even about the famous co-ops)? Or maybe, what would you choose?

I would greatly appreciate any thoughts and suggestions!! Thanks!

Having a completely online no partial credit for work "mastering" physics 1 final is fucking ridiculous
Physics is all about the process and having a final through mastering physics is fucking dumb. Stop being lazy professors and actually hand grade our tests. Physics is about the process and not about the answer and by grading through mastering physics yall don't give a shit. Yall are just lazy and don't wanna spend the time and effort grading our tests.

Hey, international student from India here. I just accepted my offer to Northeastern yesterday, and now have the option to select if I'm interested in the Global ConnEXions program or not by May 1st.

CAMD grading scale??
Hi I am a silly little engineering student who decided to take some design classes.

Most of my engineering classes have grading scales that are like: 

90 A-
80 B+
70 B-
60 C
50 C-

Or something like that. I have no idea what CAMD standard grading scales are like and one of my teachers hasn’t given a single grade back yet so I have no idea what grade I have in the class.

Anyway should I assume it’s 
95 A
93 A-
90 B+
85 B

What can I do with Fundies 1?
So I'm not a Comp Sci Major and have Fundies 1 in my course list for Fall 2021. I know it's programming basics and sets a good foundation but I eventually want to do stuff with UI/UX Design, front end and back end web development and making art n stuff with coding (I'm a rising second year design major. I was aiming for a Comp Sci minor and completing some classes in the Summer but I had a change of plans and I don't think I'll have time to finish a Comp Sci minor so for now I'm just taking Fundies.

Also I don't know what Racket is but it seems like not a lot of people use it in comp sci and it just seems like something profs use to help us understand programming conceptually but I'm not sure how useful it will be for my field. 

What can I do with Fundies in UI/UX Design / web dev, and is there any other course that I should take? Or should I just not take the class altogether?

Is NUIN Boston going to be like this?
Northeastern is my dream school, and I got into the NUIN Boston and will choose Boston because I do not want to go abroad (with or without COVID, I want to be in Boston). I was doing some research, and this doesn't seem pleasant at all

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/NEU/comments/imrutd/what\_its\_like\_in\_nuin\_boston/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NEU/comments/imrutd/what_its_like_in_nuin_boston/)

* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rABvrBxVI0U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rABvrBxVI0U)

I've heard of some of the issues such as Westin being a little far from the campus, and having a slight difficulty integrating with students after the NUIN semester, but I am fine with those.

I also had another questions about NUIN, how long is it? I heard it's only the first semester, so am I right in saying that I will only spend around 15 weeks in Westin, and once it's over I'll be housed on campus with all the other students?

TLDR NEU is my dream school, but I'm worried about the NUIN Boston program

incoming freshman in CS seeking advice
&#x200B;

Hi everyone,

I am incoming freshman and I would appreciate any advice/suggestions. I have some concerns about the CS program. I am already taken most of the Y1 classes through AP or dual enrollment. Should I re-take the CS classes? (I have already taken java, python and network security). Can I skip them if I already know the material or are they taught at a more advanced level?

Also, I am considering minoring in computer engineering, any advice on that? (I have read a lot reviews saying that the CE classes are not that rigorous, a waste of time, etc... is that true?) Is it possible to skip classes in CE?

Many thanks,

Z

CPT & Co-Op for Masters in Finance
Hey everyone! I was recently told by a friend that the Masters in Finance program at NEU (16 month track) will not get Int'l students a CPT for Internships and/ or Co-Ops during summer. Is this true? If yes, then I might now take the offer given I'll be missing out on what is the biggest advantage of being at NEU and Boston I suppose. Really bummed after learning about this :/ I've written to someone, but haven't received a response yet. Really hope it's a lie.

Choosing Freshmen Dorms By Building or LLC
I just committed to Northeastern today! I am now looking to choose my dorm, but don't know whether I should do it based off of my building preference or my LLC preference. I am going to be majoring in CS, so I wanted to do the CS LLC. However, I am not a huge fan of White Hall. I had been hoping to live in a two-person suite with a shared bathroom, which is only offered in Hemenway, Midtown, International Village, and East Village. Of those, I think International Village and East Village are my two favorites. So, my question is whether I should just suck it up about the dorm situation and do the CS LLC because it fits with my interest, or if I should pick the nicer dorm even if it doesn't necessarily align with who I am. With that being said, however, I might apply for the Honors college after my first semester which could allow me to be in the Honors LLC in IV.

hi everyone! i am a fall 2021 transfer applicant and was wondering if anyone has received their admissions decisions yet/ when they have been released in previous years. the housing signups for the other schools i am considering are starting to be released and i’m getting worried that if i wait too long i’ll get a crap assignment. thank you!

is it worth the debt?
Hey guys, sorry if this is annoying since i know y’all have seen posts like this. I’m just heavy conflicted about the college i should attend and i need to decide soon, so I would love to hear any students input on where to go. Thank you!

A bit about me: im into arts, i care about social life, nd I do best when I'm challenged. I just wanna be somewhere that I'll thrive the most!

**Northeastern University** (39k/yr)

**Major:** Computer Science + Design

NU Pros:

•	⁠absolutely love the city environment, just visited Boston and it's great!

 •	⁠campus is dope too 

•	⁠honors program= lots of abroad opportunities! 

•	⁠Coop means i can get some returns $$ and job security in the future 

•	⁠really interested in their core curriculum and way of teaching CS 

•	⁠they offer cool animation classes (one of my passions)

 •	⁠I like their living-learning programs 

•	⁠Want to attend a diff. college than most of my high school peers & start anew 

•	⁠i love huskies LOL

NU Cons:

•	⁠!expensive! I'd estimate \~50k debt out of college (coop can potentially change that number) which is scary and might limit me 

•	⁠Boston weather. I really dont like the cold besides skiing and cozy fits 

•	⁠smaller school w less spirit 

•	⁠less ethnically diverse!

**UMD-College Park** (20k/yr)

**Major:** Immersive Media Design

UMD Pros:

•	⁠totally affordable for my family (instate + scholarships), no debt 

•	⁠Got placed in the best dorms on campus 

•	⁠more school spirit and a bit more diversity(both are PWI anyways) 

•	really ⁠cool major

 •	⁠campus is bigger? 

•	⁠warmer weather! 

•	⁠more comfortable transition with friends + family closeby

UMD Cons:

•	⁠I prefer an urban environment and College Park doesn’t provide that (but it is near DC subway) 

•	Major is new, making me kind of a guinea pig for the program 

•	Not a big fan of my LLP being just like my major 

•	⁠stigma of 'the place everyone goes to' and overall less exciting to me 

•	fewer opportunities for coop and study abroad, though not impossible

Kinda salty at Northeastern for not taking my request for more money, but at the same time UMD probably would do the same if I asked. I'm in a lucky position to have been accepted and received scholarships and honors to both schools. The question I keep asking is: Am I willing to take on 50k to thrive in NEU or not worry about money at my state school?

Living off campus but still need to get tested?
I’m planning on living off campus in one of the zip codes listed in the email but I have about two months before my co op starts. So I won’t be on campus at all. Is neu allowed to mandate that I get covid tested regularly? I’m not super close to campus and it seems unnecessary

Retake a failed class on the transcript for grad school applications
Third-year student here and expected to **fail** one class by the end of this final week. In this fall, I am planning to retake a withdrawn class during fall 2020 also a failed one in 2021.

Just wondering what will that be on my transcript when grad school sees that I am doing these classes again? Will that be a major impact?

Also, I am aware that everyone is affected by COVID, it's not a ez year, I have been remote for 2 semesters and to be honest, being a student for over a decade,2020,2021 might be the worst time ever.

Looking for Roommate(s)
Hi,

I know I'm a bit late; my current apartment lease ends June 30 2021. I'm looking for roommates to move in with starting July 1st until end of December 2021. Hoping to stay preferably close to uni; PM me if you're looking for an extra roommate :)

Data Science and Econ Major
I am an incoming freshman currently majoring in data science and economics, and I was just looking for some advice on my combined major. So I’ve heard some things about CSSH being underfunded but im assuming economics is one of the most popular majors in it, so it should be better maybe? If anyone could speak on their experience with economics at neu I would appreciate it. About the other major, data science, I was curious about the major itself really, not specifically at northeastern since anything in khoury should be pretty solid. In the future I would like to get into something in data science or like quant finance, but I’ve heard that since data science is such a new major it may just be better to major in comp sci, and many employers dont really recognize the validity of a data science degree? What do u guys think? Thanks in advance

Northeastern vs Tufts please help!!!
Hi!

I'm deciding between Northeastern and Tufts and was wondering if anyone had any insight. For Tufts, I will be majoring in computer science, while I will be studying comp sci and business at NEU. 

**NEU:** 

Pros: in the city, co-op, brighter campus, has business- whereas Tufts does not, ranked higher for comp sci and business, I could always apply to get into the honors program

Cons: I'll spend more money if I'm in the city, louder, larger school, can be hard to maintain friendships with co-op, less cohesive student body, didn't let me into the honors program smh

&#x200B;

**Tufts:**

Pros: more prestigious overall, fits my vibe (quiet and intellectual), I've heard they have better food, more low-key environment, quieter

Cons: ranked lower for comp sci, doesn't have business, less to do (20 mins away from the city), could be gloomy in the winter, living is Medford as an upperclassman isn't super appealing

&#x200B;

Any help would be much appreciated- I'm so conflicted :(

Looking for a summer sublet at Lightview
Hi! Long shot and definitely late in the game, but I'm an incoming transfer student, so I'm looking to take over someone's private bedroom at Lightview, if anyone has one they hate and want to give up for the summer.

Needs to be: On floors 17-21, a private bedroom, and preferably with females, but I'll survive if it's co-ed with another girl there, at the very least. DM me if you have one!
--------------------------------------------------
Just failed my final
And I don't feel distraught. I mean, I'm dismayed because there's a low chance I'll have to re-take the class, but I'm mostly just like "...darn". Usually, I get a massive, visceral reaction to stuff like this. Just earlier in the semester, I was bawling my eyes out over co-ops and last time I took a final, I freaked out because I didn't finish in time.

What's wrong with me lol. I still have one more final left. My grades have taken a huge dive this semester, much worse than my typical standards, but I don't really care. I really hope this doesn't continue for my next semesters because this is kinda scary.

Chance of success as a transfer?
Hello there. I’m currently a junior at a state uni. Last semester I found out NEU and really regretted that I didn’t find it sooner. I’m apply for the fall this year, have a gpa of 3.59 (will probably be better because I submitted mid-term report) as a biochem, going to be a pharmacist. It looks a bit worrying largely because of last year’s pandemic and I took 18 credits of course in the summer. No internship etc (looking to get one thru coop), spent all the free time on piano (reason why I want be in Boston). 

Could anyone with similar experience give me a peace of mind please? I know at this point only thing I could do is wait but I just can’t help.

Tips for moving apartments?
Hi! I will be moving for the first time in a few weeks. This is the first time I won't have access to a car or elevator (third floor apartment), so I will be using Northeastern's big carts to bring my stuff to the new apartment. I have 1 person that will be helping me. I don't have any large furniture, just a ton of clothes, typical bathroom/bedroom stuff, food, kitchen stuff, etc. 

Any tips or experiences, or is anyone else going to be doing the same thing? I don't anticipate it will be a fun time, but if anyone has any advice or stories, that would help a ton with the nervousness I am feeling 😖

Graduation Honors Cords
Hey everyone! As a graduating 5th year I have no idea how we are supposed to get the cords for cum laude/magna/summa? Was that part of the graduation cap and gown we ordered earlier or is there somewhere we’re supposed to pick everything up after our final GPAs are calculated?

Thanks everyone, it’s crazy how little communication there is about everything.

Is it worth the money?
I’m currently torn between northeastern and my state school. I applied for finance at both. For northeastern, I didn’t get any aid or scholarship and would have to pay in full (75k). Is it worth that much money? That’s my only concern right now — I don’t wanna graduate with crippling debt. For those of you who are undergraduates at NEU rn, were there any ways you were able to drop the cost (excluding scholarships/FA)? I was actually thinking about doing my co-ops in NYC so that I’m super close to home and won’t have to pay for a meal plan/housing during that time (but if I were to do my co-op in Boston, I’d have to still pay for meals and housing); the NYC thing could save a great deal of money if it works like the way I’m thinking it does. I also have a solid amount of AP credits I think I could apply (it’s not like I’d be able to skip a whole semester though, I don’t know how many classes I could test out of). My parents said they’ll pay 30k max a year and that I have to figure out the rest on my own, which is fair enough. That’s why I’m trying to find ways to save as much money as possible since I didn’t get aid. If any of you have any other ideas other than the co-op thing I mentioned (idk if that’ll even work tho, someone please let me know haha). Im willing to do part time jobs over the summer and use all my co-op money to pay but it still isn’t enough. Please drop any ideas and suggestions! (just as a reference: my parents will pay in full for my 4 years at my state school and then want me to do my masters at a T20, preferably an ivy - and so do I, haha. But if I’m already blowing off 75kish a year on NEU, getting my masters does not seem financially feasible).

I just really really really love northeastern. I know going to my state school makes so so SO much more sense but I just can’t let go 😭😭 this is just my last effort to see if there’s anything I can do. If not, I’m committing to my state school tomorrow.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for your feedback! Although it is all unanimous I read everything and definitely agree. I am committing to my state school (Rutgers) tomorrow!

Cars at NU.In Boston?
I got in to the NU.in program early action, and I was excited to be able to go abroad. Flash forward a month or so when they release the locations for each major. I check my options and see that I have 3 choices Boston, England, and Italy. However, I need to be 18 by August to go to England or Italy and my birthday is in September. I hadn't fully decided I wanted to go to northeastern at this point, so I thought I would try my luck and request a major change so I could switch locations (I changed to a dual major so I could keep my original choice). A couple weeks later I found out it worked and I would be able to go to Greece which I was extatic about because I had taken Ancient Greek at my school for 3 years. Flash forward to the beginning of April I have received all of my regular decision acceptances, and plan to visit my top choices. Last week I visited Northeastern's campus, and really loved it. I was ready to make my choice, but was still a little uncertain so I put off making the deposit until today, where I checked my portal and immediately had an existential crisis. The Greece program was "full" and now my only option is NU.in Boston. Now after a few hours where I had time to recollect my thoughts I was wondering if there were any positives of NU.in Boston, hence the question "cars at NUin Boston?" 

TLDR; I waited to long to accept my decision of going to Greece though NU.in, and now am left with 5 days to decide if NU.in Boston is worth it. (Cost is not a major issue)

Osccr hearing but Graduating in 2 weeks??
Imagine, you’re a 5th year, graduating in 2 weeks from now as per the title. You get an email, something along the lines of “important message from osccr.” You open it. It’s for Something you didn’t think you’d get in trouble for (was what I did even bad?), that happened last month. It’s only an administrative hearing, it can’t be that bad, you’ve read the r/NEU post about the guy who went to osccr 20 times. But at the same time... could it be bad? It says your allegations are for disorderly conduct, and misrepresentation of information. You’d like to hear what the person from osccr has to say by playing dumb in a reply email. “What situation is the letter regarding?” 
From here... Do you continue to play the card: “I was just giving examples to X of XX documents that I was wondering if these types would be acceptable.” “I wasnt sure what documents X was asking for so I sent examples.” “I basically am very dumb and don’t understand things.” ?
Or. Do you have a better solution to get out of this? ie just admit to it and hope for no severe sanctions, or just straight pray they don’t even want to deal with your case. 

Suggestions for how to deal w osccr?

NUin Greece Passport??
Hi! I'm a student who chose to do NUin Greece, however I don't have a passport yet. Apparently it takes a passport 10-12 weeks to process even if I pay for the expedited time because of the COVID crisis, and the proof of my passport is due June 1st so Northeastern can give us the information we need to obtain visas. Can any prior NUin students without a passport before doing NUin tell me how they were able to obtain a passport in the time limit and does anyone know who I would reach out to at NU about potentially not having the passport in time?

Thanks for the comments and advice?

extra stainless steel cutlery needed
Moving out? Have excess stainless steel cutlery? I'm a Prof building a data sculpture about hunger in MA and need your spoons, forks, or knives! I'm leaving a box later today in the hallway on the first floor of Lake Hall that you can drop them in, or message me on here to set up a hand-off time.

Some details about this project:

"  
It’s hard to imagine the scale of hunger in the state.  Thousands of families don’t have the food that they need, and the pandemic has made the problem worse than ever.  As a way to help us all understand the numbers in a new way, we're making a sculpture of a table out of 1,659 stainless steel forks, knives and spoons.  Each piece of cutlery will represent one of the new families that applied for SNAP benefits EACH DAY in Massachusetts from March to April, as the pandemic was beginning.  The sculpture will be displayed outdoors throughout the region with information about food insecurity and how we can all help to address the problem.  Right now we need your help.  Please share this message with your colleagues and friends. Thanks!  
"

We’re hoping to build this up over the summer and are working with some local partners already to be displaying it this fall. I’ll be connecting with campus groups once we have more to show and hope to have it on campus for a spell as well! Remember - it's gotta be stainless steel (to make the welding easier) - if a magnet sticks to it then its probably good for us.

Pre-med Co-ops?
Hello! Am a prospective student here, and just had a couple of questions about the pre-med co-ops...

1. What were they like? 
2. What was the process of applying to them? Was it competitive/difficult?
3. How were the experiences in terms of both the clinical co-ops and research co-ops?
4. If possible, did they end up being beneficial for medical school applications?
5. And are they the same as internships, or are they completely separate things?

Thank you!

Any places that’s less crowded or even a good place to chill and relax? And please don’t say Curry- with the amount of people there,my anxiety goes off the charts!

-Also I heard there was a game room?👀 Any news about that? Are there consoles set up to play or is there only tables games?

Northeastern Non-guaranteed Transfer Dorms
Hi, I'm a transfer applicant to Northeastern. For my first year on any campus, I want to dorm and wanted to know if the non-guarantee is a big problem for transfers. I found out that Northeastern doesn't guarantee dorm to transfers and wanted to know if any transfer students have had any problems with this. Is there a way for transfer students to guarantee a dorm in some unconventional way? Or will I have to look for roommates and apartments wherever I go just in case? Please let me know if you know anything about this, I'm really curious and worried that it might inadvertently affect my decision process.

What to do when N.U.in location is filled up?
Hi guys, I am wondering if anyone also had a similar experience where the N.U.in location they wanted was filled up. I wanted to go to Greece because they were the only location that offers pre-med students the courses they need to avoid taking additional summer classes. I swear when I checked the site yesterday they were still open. However, it says they’re all full today and now i don’t know what to do. I paid my deposit for NUin Boston and emailed them, but is there anything else I could do to get my name off the waitlist? Thank you everyoneee I’m kinda desperate right now

NEU Computer Science classes difficulty and workload. Please share your experiences.
I recently got admitted to the master's in CS align program. I am confident about my skills but I have been hearing some extreme opinions from people who struggled a lot.

* How hard and intense is the computer science program? 
* In a normal week do you have time to hit the gym, have leisure time, play games, or gather with your friends (responsively)?
* Are you all sleeping well (on average)? 

Thank you.

(------you don't have to read this part.--------)

I would become an international student and with the pandemic and all the tragedies surrounding me, I don't think I am ready for a program so hard it makes me lose my sanity abroad.

I have been preparing for this since August 2020, I know the basic stuff and some more complex concepts. However, I have not taken any math classes since I was in high school.

I just do not want to lose my time, money, and the joy I have for programming.

Is Carter Playground open to the general public or just Northeastern students?
My parents just moved to Brookline right near Boston from New Jersey and this is the first time I'm going to be there, but some of my friends live in Boston, and we wanted to play a full game of soccer or football at least a couple times a week while I'm visiting this summer. Is that allowed without a permit? I don't go to Northeastern, but when I looked up fields near Brookline I saw this one was funded by you all or some shit

Deleted post about a rally against Lightview 2.
Okay so someone posted about a rally against the development of Lightview 2 at 840 Columbus, which is a parking lot apparently (according to the huntnewsnu article announcing this). It's put together by "Fight the NEU Luxury Dorm" on Facebook. I browsed the FB page and saw a lot of misdirected anger like being upset about the expansion of NUPD (despite the building being on 840 Columbus, which already has NUPD presence bc it's literally down the street from 2 police stations) and gentrification (which I talk about in my comment) and the group's statements below:

We demand:
>>1. Stop gentrification: Northeastern administration and President Aoun should halt the plans to build a Luxury &amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;dorm at 840 Columbus Avenue

>>2. Build more AFFORDABLE housing: the Boston Planning and Development Agency and Interim Mayor Kim Janey should construct a high quality, union built, publicly affordable housing complex for Roxbury residents at 840 Columbus Avenue.

>>3. Make dorms affordable: no student should have to pay luxury prices, all dorms should be affordable to all students. 

>>4. Implement rent control and tax corporations and the big universities to fund high quality public affordable housing for all.


The user deleted it after I commented, but I genuinely wanted to have a conversation about it, so if anyone has any thoughts, I am including my original comment below:

>>*As someone who lives in Lightview, I hate it just as much as the next person for being expensive and disorganized. I agree that in an ideal world, the rent should be much less.

>>But can someone explain to me why building another luxury apt is a bad thing? I thought providing a space for students relieves the stress on the housing market in surrounding areas. I saw a video about how building luxury high rises for young professionals/students is actually anti-gentrification. Gentrification means people moving into already existing housing, and driving up the rent costs there right? So how is building MORE housing in an area currently serving as a parking lot a bad thing?

>>Edit: My thinking is that LV provides a lot of amenities and is all inclusive, while still at the same price point as on-campus. For many students, LV is a better option than off-campus apts, even with its many issues. If these students can afford this price and also like the perks that DO come with LV, then they'll chose LV over off-campus. If the new LV was cheaper, it likely wouldn't provide the same amenities or include utilities as it does now, so why would students chose it over off-campus? They wouldn't, so they would just move off campus anyway and the building wouldn't help w gentrification at all. Does that make sense?? Lol*

Quite the Pickle. Loans v Free State School
So I'm in quite the pickle and I'm trying to figure it out. I'm currently down to either Northeastern or SUNY Binghamton for college. I like Northeastern better in every aspect except for the money. If I went to Binghamton my parents would cover the costs but if I go to Northeastern I would have to take out around 25-30k in loans every year. After doing some calculations, I'd probably have around 90k in loans after graduation. Here are the reasons I'm still considering Northeastern.

&#x200B;

1. I plan on majoring in Computer Science at NEU which has a very high median salary directly after graduation (around 88k). According to most loan recommendations, you shouldn't take out a loan greater than what you expect to make after 1 year of working.
2. Computer Science co-ops pay well so I would use a lot of the money to cover as much of the loan as I can. Binghamton isn't in a big city like Boston so internship opportunities aren't as good. I wouldn't expect to get a good internship / make a lot of money while in school at Bing.
3. Because of the credits that I have from high school, ill be able to at least get rid of at least one full summer term at northeastern. (English, stats, elective, calc) I would not have to pay tuition for those summer semesters so in total I would save tuition for one semester.
4. I don't really want to go to Binghamton and knowing myself if I end up miserable I won't be motivated to try academic-wise. Binghamton also has a fairly significant lower median directly after graduation for cs majors (72k). Not to mention I applied to Binghamton planning on doing a business major then doing a master's. I was interested in Northeastern CS because of the schedule flexibility for cs majors and the co-op program. Binghamton I heard has a lot of gen-ed courses which I'm not really interested in. 

Any advice would be very helpful. I plan on committing within the next few days.

What bull is this?
Got an email today: "  

**Staying in Boston During the Break** 

If you are staying on campus or in the surrounding zip codes (02115, 02118, 02119, 02120, 02130, 02215, and 02121) during the summer, you are required to continue your testing schedule, even if you do not plan to come to campus or are on co-op while living in the surrounding zip codes. Boston-based students are currently required to test every three days. The Cabot Testing Center will remain open throughout the break with [adjusted hours of operation](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fservices.northeastern.edu%2Fwellness%3Fid%3Dkb_article_view_wellness%26sysparm_article%3DKB000016515%26sys_kb_id%3D46c532671b2720105ad79683b24bcb50%26spa%3D1&data=04%7C01%7Cgersten.e%40NORTHEASTERN.EDU%7C42fd348903114589143e08d9068d4ed1%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C637548026245297407%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=dqpz8%2BR%2F8k8gR577ds5y8zTYfDZlQpPZvYeQ63x21sg%3D&reserved=0).  "  


So to be clear... if all of my classes are online and I have no intention to go on campus I have to submit to some arbitrary constant testing schedule. Its spring semester and I have only been on campus twice at most. I've never been tested for covid this semester and I don't plan on it. I'll probably get the vaccine before the fall or by the fall at the latest but this is ridiculous. I have so many more complaints about the 1985 nanny state security here, how over regulation has killed some basic learning opportunities, but I'd rather not risk being identified. Can anyone relate?  


I could use a funny NotEstabrook post to read here to lighten the mood.

Social Relationships (and Experiential Learning) at Northeastern
Hi everyone! I have a couple questions about the relationships between students at Northeastern, as well as a completely unrelated question about experiential learning in the classroom. I appreciate any insight. Here they are:  
1) Is the Northeastern community tightly knit? And by that I mean, are most people approachable and friendly and kind, or closed off to their own, already established friend group?  
2) Unrelated question (I'm focusing a bit more on the biology and business curriculum in this question, but of course anybody's insight is extremely helpful):   
Do the professors and curriculum, specifically in biology and business, do a good job of bringing in real world experiences, such as by doing labs or going over case studies/simulations? Are many classes in those fields primarily lecture based, or is there group work and discussions?  
Thank you so much!

UHCS is still garbage
So a few weeks ago I decided to get a routine test. Since UHCS is close by and more convenient, I decided to schedule through them. I had to call to schedule a video call to schedule the test, but all fine and well. 

On the day of the test I don't drink too much water (they say not to) but also didn't pee in the two hours beforehand (as they say to) but to be safe added another half hour. I go to UHCS, bladder full, right on time. 

They have absolutely  no idea who I was, no idea why I was there, anything, because the person I video called forgot to even schedule me. When finally I convinced them that I had a test scheduled then, they relented and scheduled me for an hour later. Fine, fine, I'll go on a walk or something (it was a nice day). The person said I couldn't leave because they'd already signed me in. I said fine and took a seat and went on my phone.

An hour passes by. Patients come and go. The pressure on my bladder grows.

Okay, fine, you usually have to wait in a doctor's office a few minutes before they're ready to let you in.

Another fifteen minutes pass by. I really have to pee.

Someone enters, signs in, sits down, and is called in before me.

Another ten minutes. 

Finally, driven by my bladder, I get up and go back to the counter and ask what was happening. She checks the schedule and says I'm on it, and then finally gets up and goes in the back to see what happened. The doctor hadn't updated their schedule so had no idea I existed. Alright, no big deal. I go and piss in a cup, which was really enjoyable considering I hadn't peed in nearly four hours. They have me wait in line in the back for something they don't even explain, until the doctor realized I'm in line for a blood test I didn't sign up or pay for and sent me away.

Fine, I leave, go back to the front, finish the paperwork. They mess that up too, but they get it on the second try. See the confusing thing for them was I was doing self-pay for $25 because I didn't want to go through insurance (being out-of-state, etc. etc.).  Much easier just to pay the money and be done with it. Anyways, they finally figure that out, and all is well and done. A few days later I get the results and they're negative (woo hoo). I put it far behind me and focus on finals.

Then, yesterday, I check my mail at 7:08 PM and see in it a bill for $214 from Baystate Reference Laboratories for two tests. I rush to UHCS and ask them if I'm being double charged. The person at the counter looks at the mail and starts pinching her (unmasked) lips as she reads it, which means she definitely got her fucking saliva on the mail. Anyways, after some half-hearted investigation they shrug and say Baystate should've gotten my receipt and should not charge me. No shit.

So today I call Baystate and explain to them that they should charge Northeastern for the test. The person on the other line shrugs and says they need an address and a name, and that I should get it for them. A fucking address?? Didn't they *get* the bill *from* Northeastern? Baystate is *who Northeastern tests with!* They don't know how to just charge Northeastern?? So the person on the other line finally realizes there's another person on the receipt, the client, which is Northeastern, *which has the address and everything*. At least I suppose, I have no idea what it looks like. So at that point they say "Okay we'll see what we can do."

So I ask how do I know they're actually successful. The person on the other line has no idea and just repeats what she's already said. She says that if she's not successful, I'll get a second bill. Wow, very helpful! She shunted me off to a robot who I left my name and number with.

So that's where I'm left off. UHCS messing up on quite possibly every step of the way, then doing business with a vendor who *also* messed up on every step of the way. Hopefully somebody stops messing up soon or else I'll get debt-collectors harassing me for $214 for a test I already paid for. I don't blame the individual people, who probably were undertrained or overworked or whatever, but the whole of UHCS whose error-tentacles infiltrated every step of what should've been an easy piss-in-a-cup transaction.

I cant attend NEU
I just want to cry about not being able to attend NEU because of my family’s financial situation. I really want to go to Northeastern, especially after getting accepted into the NU in program and getting a dean’s scholarship. However, even with the scholarship, the school is still super expensive. I’m personally willing to take on the debt but my parents won’t even agree to co-signing loans if I go to a school that amounts to more than 50k a year. 
My family’s financial situation has changed since the year that is required for the IDOC forms and I’ve filed an appeal but I haven’t heard back from them yet. Even so, I don’t expect to get much money at all after looking at the original financial aid package. I’m so sad that I can’t attend. It’s in Boston and I really wanted to be a part of the co-op program and start networking. 
I’m going to have to attend UMass Amherst at this point. I just really wished that I’d be able to go to NEU. Just wanted to express that. Maybe I can attend for my masters degree. Wish the best for all current and prospective students :)

Update:
Thank you so much for your responses and support. I feel so much better about going to UMass now--excited even. Thank you all for humbling me, please have a great year!

Why does literally taking 2 asynchronous classes for summer 1 literally cost $13,000?!?
Lol like wtf. I know college is expensive, but it’s kind of ridiculous, especially when NEU doesn’t even accept credits from CC or other programs. I’m not even on campus or using any of the campus amenities. I don’t see how 1 spot in a completely asynchronous class is worth $6000+. I am literally just given access to some videos. And the worst part is that I’m literally just completing some NUPath required classes that are outside my major (film and psychology). Anyone think this is absurd? Is there any way I can negotiate with student financial services to reduce the price?

Northeastern Student Body
Hey everyone. I'm thinking about commiting to Northeastern and had a question on the student body at the university.  
1) Are Northeastern students usually sharp, curious, and driven to learn for the sake of learning (not good grades, although that's definitely a part of it)?   
2) Are they knowledgable about what's going on in the world (ex. politics, social justice issues, Mars rover, etc) and open to having intellectually stimulating and respectfully opinionated conversations about it?  
Of course I want a chill and lighthearted environment too, but having deeper, more serious conversations are also fun!  
Thanks!

Free Rowing Machine (Until Fall Semester)
Hey all,

I brought a rowing machine to campus this year so that I could exercise without having to fuck with Marino or go outside in the cold. Now it's time to move out and I really don't want to have to find a place to store this thing.

Admitted student questions
Hey guys so I have like a week left to choose a college and had a couple of questions still about Northeastern. 

1) how are the research opportunities here? Do lots of people do these, or are they more focused on co-ops?
2) Northeastern is known more for co-ops, do you think that the academics are just as good as other similarly prestigious schools? 
3) How is the social scene like here, Is it easy to meet new people?
4) Are you expected to do a co-op in the first year? If I’m still unsure about my major, will I be worse off?

Thanks

Officially a Husky!!
 OK, THIS IS CRAZY. I applied to Northeastern, SJSU, and UNCC on a whim thinking I wouldn't make it but still wanted to shoot my shot. It was pretty nerve-wracking to wait and my credentials were not up there at all but I still made it to Northeastern University for this fall where I will be studying my Masters in Bioinformatics.

Now that I got in, I'm concerned about the coursework. I have a few doubts:

1. How do I prepare for the coursework over the next few months?
2. What is the co-op program like? Is it classes one semester and then co-op the next? Is it co-op during the day and classes in the evenings? How does this system work?
3. I took the Omics concentration. Will I be able to change that if I'm not feeling it?

Please take my survey so I can graduate (5 mins) - Binaural Beats
(sorry for the repost, I accidentally had limited the number of respondents to 20. I know I hate myself too) 

It's on the effects of binaural beats on short term memory. Binaural beats are caused by playing two tones that are slightly apart in frequency into each ear separately. There's been some study into its effectiveness on memory, so it might be worth putting some on in the background whilst you study for finals. Or maybe not. Idk, thats the point of the study.

NEU vs WPI - which is more worth it?
I’ve been admitted to both NEU and WPI and I’m having difficulty deciding where to go. It kinda comes down to is NEU worth 60k/year while WPI is only 40k/year. I’ve gone to virtual sessions for both schools and the general vibe I’ve gotten is that professors on average are more interested in what they’re doing at WPI and students are overall nicer (😬), but idk if that’s because of zoom and whatnot. At the same time, there are more opportunities available at NEU in terms of research and Boston is a better city than Worcester. Gotta commit soon. Slightly panicking. Any thoughts would be much appreciated :)

(Btw I come from an upper middle class family (would still like to avoid student loans))

PS I’d be studying biomedical physics or bioengineering at NEU (haven’t decided) or biomedical engineering at WPI

BU vs Northeastern vs Umass Amherst for Business
Hey everyone I posted this in the [r/boston](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/) and r/BostonU subs but thought I'd post it here too!

I was admitted to BU, Northeastern, and Umass Amherst for c/o 2025. I'm having trouble deciding where to go so I listed some of the pros/cons and I was hoping to gather options, insights, and comments about what I could do.

**Northeastern: cons**

\- have to pay in full (76k) *(this is a huge con)*

\- not a lot of school spirit but I don't really mind,

**Northeastern: pros**

\- has co-op

\- absolutely love the campus

\- love the city

**BU: cons**

\- have to pay in full (78k)

\- don't like how the campus is so spread out

\- hard to get As in Questrom BUT it's more highly ranked than the other two schools.

**BU: pros**

\- Questrom is much more well known

\- BU is more recognized nationally

**Umass Amherst cons:**

\- It's 90 minutes from my house and i don't like the drive AT ALL because I'm super close to my family and I'll probably see them a lot.

\- I don't like any of the dorms

\- not close to a major city so more difficult to get internships

\- business school (Isenberg) isn't as highly ranked

\- doesn't really have much interdisciplinary learning

**Umass Amherst pros:**

\- i get instate so I pay half the cost of BU or NEU

\- has a lot of school spirit

\- has great food

Overall I really like Northeastern but since it is kind of difficult for my family to pay in full so is it worth the money? I want to go into healthcare management so which school can prepare me the best? Also, can I apply for scholarships or grants after I'm a student to help pay for college because I really don't want to take out a loan?

Thank you so much and I'd really appreciate any other insight you could provide me!

Burned out, low grade, don't know what to do. Any advice?
Just received "final" grades before taking final exams, and things just don't look good.

I've already withdrew one of my required class because I felt like I can't handle four classes this semester. I was like, hey, things should go well with three classes.

After taking midterm exam I was so burned out and breaking apart I was not able to focus on anything for the whole month. Rarely attended classes, fucked up my group projects, and frequently forgot to submit discussions and finish assignments... I was just hoping things will end.

I've increased my dose after reaching out to local psychiatrist, and things actually have gotten slightly better, but then now I'm stuck with an extremely low participation grades for all of them. I just don't know what to do. It's like C, B-, B right now but I am definitely not prepared for final exams so I am skeptical if I can maintain those grades. Am I overreacting? What should I do to make things better

Oh and did I mentioned that my first class starts at 10PM and last one ends at 1:30AM? This is a hilarious time difference. No wonder why I was not able to focus and fucked up my group project lmao My antidepressant weakens as soon as my class starts, and of course I can't communicate to my group members while I'm sleeping. Why am I staying at here i'm desperate to go back to Boston.

Retake? Withdraw? Keep the grade? Like what should I realistically do & how does it affect my coop and potentially grad school?

Should I take strategy over summer 1 or during summer 2 on co-op
Summer 1 option:
- 8-9:40am M-Th
- I plan on traveling internationally for two weeks during this term with a few weekend trips as well
- technically have another internship I’ll be doing at the same time (10-15 hours a week)
- prof is Joseph Raynus, the workload doesn’t seem too bad based on Canvas syllabus but his ratemyProfessor ratings are bad 

Summer 2 option:
- 11:40am-1:20pm, so basically during my co-op lunch break. I have a good amount of control over my co-op schedule so it should work. 
- won’t be traveling nearly as much 
- prof is Diletta Masiello, who I don’t know much about. She has one ratemyprof rating from when she was at Georgetown and it’s not favorable so idk 

I’m currently registered for both and wanna figure out which one is better. This would be the only course I take over the summer. It’s the only time I can take it as I’m taking an online class in the fall to work with my co-op schedule and then graduating in December.

TIA!

Is the Honors college actually selective?
Hi. I'm a senior in high school considering NU and was admitted into the Honors College with a 22k/year scholarship. I'm really glad about this but have noticed that practically everyone else at my school who applied to NU also got into the honors college... This leads me to ask just how selective the honors college really is? With an acceptance rate of 18% according to Google, I thought NU would reject much more applicants?

Types of Conversations with NEU Students
Hi everyone. I'm in the process of choosing colleges and Northeastern is high up on my list. I have some general atmosphere questions about the university. Here they are:

1) When you go up to students during the day or in class, is it common to have random intellectually stimulating (but not necessarily academic) conversations, such as about human nature or diving deep into some scientific concept? Or are the conversations mainly light-hearted? 

2) What are some examples of these deeper conversations in your experiences, if they do in fact occur?

3) Do students 'geek out' with each other on topics of interest, like astronomy, the environment, biology, etc? I'm asking because if I have something that I find super cool to share about, such as the Mars Rover, for example, would I basically be the only one contributing to that conversation and others will just be uninterestedly listening or not knowledgable, or would myself and others contribute and 'geek out' together?

Thanks!

How hard is mechanical engineering?
Hi I’m a senior in high school who is going into mechanical engineering. I know engineering is hard at any school but I assume it is a lot more demanding at a school like NEU. If someone could share their experience with test, homework, studying, how much free time you have, the projects and labs you worked on, etc... I would be super grateful. I’m also going in through the NU.in Boston program so if someone would like to share their experience with that and what elective I should take that would also be amazing.

Advice on co-op please
So a company I am co-oping for is not necessarily used to neu co-ops. They are used to co-ops staying with them throughout cycles (maybe there are some that do expect this from neu students as well. Could be wrong). I would like to say that I did a good job and believe they want me to stay. Although I wouldn’t be opposed to having this option open in the future, I did want to use co-op as a way to pursue different industries/specialties before committing. Is there really any way to say this nicely as to not burn any bridges?

I wanna preface this by saying I understand that I should be happy to be in this sort of situation.

Any ideas what "Return to Normal" will look like?
I'm a rising NEU sophomore that did my entire first year virtually. I simply did not want to live in an environment that sent students home for 11 being in a room even though everyone is forced to get tested every three days and wear a mask even when walking by themselves outside. I'm super excited to have received my second Pfizer vaccine dose a few weeks ago, and will be on campus for Fall 21. Any ideas what the environment on campus will be like? It seems beyond absurd to think that, after mandating vaccinations for all students and staff, that they would continue to rule with such a heavy iron fist, but I also fear that this power may have gone to the administration's head already, and they will continue to force things like biweekly testing and masking when you're sitting alone out in the grass. 

I'm sure that I will be downvoted for this, and I apologize if it comes off as dismissive of the steps northeastern took this year to keep students, staff, and the surrounding community safe. I believe that northeastern's protocols did a great job of preventing COVID spread; I simply made a personal decision that an environment driven by rules and by fear wasn't conducive to my happiness. However, I think it is fair to be angry if we all do our part, get vaccinated, and come back only to find that Estabrook's idea of a "much more normal fall" is just as Orwellian as the one from the previous year. Thanks in advance for your input!
--------------------------------------------------
Networks Before Systems?
I’ve noticed that there are mixed opinions about whether or not you should take systems before or after networks and was wondering if anyone could give me some insight. Additionally, would taking networks, human computer interaction, and algorithms at the same time be too much? They would all be happening on Tuesday and Friday. Thank you!

MATH 3181: Advanced Probability and Statistics
Hello! About one year ago, there was a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NEU/comments/fuh1o2/advanced_probability_and_statistics/) introducing the accelerated section of MATH 3081: Probability and Statistics. As a follow-up to that post, the accelerated section has become a class of its own: MATH 3181: Advanced Probability and Statistics!  


This course is being offered in Fall 2021, so if you're planning on taking MATH 3081 this fall, please consider taking MATH 3181 as an alternative. You'll still get credit for MATH 3081 by taking this course as the same content is covered (though you may have to request an override with your counselor), but MATH 3181 has an emphasis on proofs and involves multivariable calculus (MATH 2321 is a required prerequisite). Currently, only four students are registered for this class, so we need one more person to register in order for the class to be run.

&#x200B;

If you would like to see a syllabus of the accelerated section of MATH 3081 to get a better idea of what the class will be like, please DM me and I can share it with you.

Fundies Advice
So let's say I'm on track to pass Fundies 1 and satisfy the prerequisite for Fundies 2. Is it important to actually have retained the information that was taught in Fundies 1 in order to take Fundies 2? I had a terrible semester and didn't do well at all and I'm only passing because of my partner, an angel sent from heaven. I have no problem retaking Fundies 1 this summer to actually understand the content this time and do well, the only thing is that it would change the plan I have for which classes I want to take which really isn't that big of a deal. Will retaking Fundies 1 help me better understand whatever they're going to go over in Fundies 2 or would I be better off just taking Fundies 2 this summer because it has nothing to do with Fundies 1?

I know there are some published stats out there about co-op pay and I know it varies major to major and also depends on previous experience but if you co-oped in the fall of 20, spring of 21, or even if you know what your upcoming co-op is going to pay! Please vote Im just curious

Plan of Study Computer Science
Hello, I've committed to Northeastern and am looking at the sample plan of study that is on the Northeastern catalog ([http://catalog.northeastern.edu/undergraduate/computer-information-science/computer-science/bscs/#planofstudytext](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/undergraduate/computer-information-science/computer-science/bscs/#planofstudytext)) and was curious about the layout. I'm planning to graduate in 4 years, but was slightly concerned about the classes that were in the summer, since I wasn't planning on taking courses over the summer. I take full responsibility for not doing my research properly. Is there a way to take the summer courses/electives during my fall and spring semesters or I am going to have to go in during the summer to take these classes. Thank you!
--------------------------------------------------
Is it possible to get the meal plan waived for the Summer?

Possible to run from Shillman Hall to Dodge Hall in 10 minutes?
As the title says above. I have PSYC3406 until 11:35am and PHIL1145 starting at 11:45am. I am currently a freshman and haven't been on campus for a year now, so I don't know how big the campus is. Will it be physically possible for me to run from SH to DG in 10 minutes and still make it on time?
--------------------------------------------------
I noticed that students are struggling with grades and GPA problems for the last 2 online semesters, how does retake a class in the future semester affects grad-schools applications?
To an extent, I messed up 2 of my required courses this semester and planned to retake them this fall, how is that going to affect my transcript， grad-school admission office's view, on the basis of I am doing these 2 semesters online+jetlag exams?

How was your experience with CS 3500?
I am planning to take CS 3500 in summer 1, and was wondering if it’s a good idea considering it’s half the time than fall or spring. Also, how was it for you guys and if there are any tips on how to do well, and how are the TAs for this course?

Looking for advice on whether or not to accept a co-op offer
Hey y'all,

So last week I got an offer for an IT support internship at a very large software/engineering company right outside of Boston. They have given me a week to accept/decline, but I am honestly so 50/50 about it. Basically I think I would be really good at it, and probably enjoy it, but I also want to do something a bit more, well, influential, considering most days I would probably just be plugging in computers all day and saying "did you turn it off and on again" on the phone. I am a computer engineering and computer science major and have been learning so much about engineering and development, and I would probably rather be on the developing and designing sort of things vs. fixing things. Also this would be my first co-op. Here's a little pros and cons list about it:

**Pros:**

* An actual offer - I might not even get another one after this one, but I have another interview prospectively scheduled for something I'm more interested in
* I'd be really good at it - I'm an extravert, huge people person, and really good at customer service
* Multi-billion dollar company, thousands of employees
* Talking to people all day, many networking opportunities
* Possible room for growth, gets my foot in the door of a huge engineering company
* I'm interested in both hardware and software, and this would be a combination of both
* Close to Boston
* Great internship program, they do retreats and fun things for all the interns
* Met the entire team I would be working with, super chill and funny group of guys with similar interests
* I would also be assigned some longer-term projects
* Maybe I would actually really enjoy it? Good combination of who I am, super social and technical
* They have their own makerspace for anyone to use which is pretty cool

**Cons:**

* Pay could be better
* Seems pretty repetitive, would be doing a lot of troubleshooting, lots of "did you try turning it off and on again"
* I don't think I want to have a career in IT
* I wouldn't be able to utilize a lot of skills I've developed from my classes
* I don't really get excited by it - some other co-ops that I have seen really pique my interest and make me excited, but this seems kinda bland if you catch my drift.
* I would rather have more influence on a company and innovate more, perhaps in a startup environment

Basically, I guess it boils down to if I want do a co-op I know would go well or if I want to actually learn, gain experience, and make a difference.

Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated! Thanks everyone and good luck with your upcoming finals!

&#x200B;

EDIT: I ended up accepting it! Sure the pay might not be great and I might have some repetitive tasks here and there, but I think it would be great to get my foot in the door of a huge company with a plethora of networking opportunities. To be honest I don't really know what I want for a career, and maybe I'll really like this! Thanks everyone for the help!

I'm going to have to drop 2 of my 4 classes. How screwed am I?
Saw the other post on the front page and figured I would ask. Already sent an email to my academic advisor and financial aid counselor.
--------------------------------------------------
how is NEU at appealing merit aid? Has leveraging an offer from a similarly ranked school ever worked for anybody?
title!
--------------------------------------------------
Financial Aid "Your family will have 2 students enrolled..."
My financial aid offer says that my offer is based on the fact that, "Your family will have 2 students enrolled full-time in college from July 1, 2021 - June 30, 2022." Does this mean my sibling needs to be enrolled throughout this entire period? Most college graduatations are in May, so would it be fine if my sibling graduates then and isn't a full time student in June? Or should I bring this up with the financial aid office?

Mission hill
Hey   
upcoming student here at northeastern. So regarding housing we found quite a few good places in mission hill on tremont street. Its near roxbury crossing. Ive been hearing too many mixed opinions about how safe mission hill or roxbury crossing is. Can anyone shed some light on this?

I am also a little confused as to how people say roxbury crossing is unsafe but brigham circle is when they are like half a mile from each other. 

note: Just a really confused student here. Not looking to offend anyone or anything if they are from boston or have lived there.

Biochem & Bioengineering or CS & Economics
Okay, I'm going to preface this by saying that I know that this is a *very*, *very,* subjective question. I am well aware that there is no "right" answer or magic formula to decide this - all I want are opinions, thoughts, experiences, and viewpoints on this.

I know that the proper way to make this choice is to pick which side I enjoy more. In terms of enjoyment, there isn't really a big enough difference for that to help my choice. (I like science a lot and I also like computer science, and adding in economics gives me more options)

So, yeah, for anyone who's taken either one of these combined majors, what was your experience like?   In terms of future job prospects/salary/stability, which one would be better/worth the time and money to pursue? (I am 100% aware that no one can predict the future, but I am just curious to see what people *think*)  
An equally difficult question - which one is more difficult?

Ease of Switching Majors at NEU
Hi everyone. I had a couple of questions about switching majors between different schools at NEU (ex. from College of Science to School of Business or College of Engineering). I would leave the original school (CoS, for example) completely and enter the other one. Here are my questions:

1) If I meet all the entrance criteria for a specific college (GPA and grades on certain prerequisite courses), am I an automatic admit to that college? Can they deny me even if I meet the criteria? 

2) Do I have to write an essay to transfer, or is it solely based on grades? I know that for Bouve I do, but what about other schools?

3) Am I competing against any other students when switching schools?

4) Slightly unrelated question: Can I double major (not combined major) between colleges at NEU (one major in biology and another in business administration or international relations)?

Thank you so much!

How to smoke cigarettes in your dorm room (without your roommate knowing)!!!
Ok so I don’t know how many of you guys smoke cigarettes, but personally I smoke a pack a day. In order to smoke inside your dorm when your roommate is either out or sleeping, your going to need a few things. First, cigarettes obviously. Second, a paper towel roll and dryer sheets. Third, an open window. To do this, you light your cigarettes while making sure as much of the smoke is going out the window as possible. Then you inhale, and blow it through the paper towel roll with dryer sheets inside. Then once the cig is done, simply run the bathroom and flush it. Little to no smell. Hope this helps!

How important is systems knowledge for CS 3700 (Networks)?
From Professor Wilson’s course website

*The official prerequisites for this course is CS 2510. That said, this course is systems oriented, so we expect you to understand the basics of computer architecture and operating systems, and to have experience implementing non-trivial systems-type projects. Basic knowledge of the Unix command line is essential. You should know how to write code using emacs/vim, write a makefile, compile code using makefiles, check for running processes, kill runaway processes, and create compressed archives. Experience with a debugger is recommended.*

I don’t really have much experience with any of these. i’ve taken algo and OOD but again, i’ve never worked with emacs, debuggers, makefiles or systems projects. 

Just wondering if prior experience is essential and if it’s even worth taking the course when i don’t have any experience with these. Thanks!

Any Advice for Dealing with Registration/Advising as Double Major?
So registration for fall 2021 was the first time I ran into major problems but I can only see it getting worse from here because I'm assuming at higher level classes there will be even more "College Restriction" errors. Long story short I'm a first year Bio and Health Science Double Major, except I wasn't able to register/waitlist for a two of my bio courses (one of which was my co-op prep course and I'm planning on doing the spring/summer I cycle but at this rate not sure if that's going to happen) this week because of "college restriction" errors. I didn't expect this problem because 1. I'm in the college of science because of my major and 2. NUBanner planning didn't tell give me any registration errors. I now apparently have to get overrides for all my biology courses with college or major restrictions, even though again I'm in the College of Science with a Biology Major. I should've seen this coming probably given that NUPAWS doesn't show my Bio major on my degree audit, but according to my Health science Bouve advisor it's because of the system. 

*Speaking of advisors,* I just straight up don't have a COS advisor for Bio major and every time I've asked someone about it, like the person I planned my second major with and my own Bouve advisor, they just don't answer the question even though I was initially told I would get a second advisor from COS. So I don't have anyone in COS to give me override's to take the courses required for my Biology Major except for the head of scheduling Aaron Roth, who's ghosted my past 3 emails. And the one time he did respond to my email about a completely different topic (it was about whether genetic labs summer 2 would be asynchronous or in person), it took him a significant time delay which you can't really afford with registration most of the time. 

I'm really confused about what I'm expected to do in terms of registration and advising. Am I supposed to have an advisor? Is this college/major restriction issue going to happen every single registration cycle? Who am I supposed to be talking to about all of this? I feel bad having to constantly send emails to my advisor and random people in the Bio department and COS advising and then getting annoyed that they either don't have answers or respond in a huge time but I don't really have other administrators to turn to for help so like any advice about how to handle this would be super helpful.

Have any upperclassmen/lurker alumni done the PlusOne program for COE?
I think I want to do a BS in Bioengineering and an accelerated MS in Mechanical.

Even if you didn’t do Engineering PlusOne can you tell me your experiences?

Incoming CS student, does it matter if I get a Macbook or Windows laptop?
Sorry I honestly know jack shit about laptops and I haven’t bought one in like 7 years. Looking for something around/under 1k, don’t need it for gaming at all. 

Just curious for CS does it matter which one I get? Are there any you would you recommend? I’ve heard the M1 MacBooks in particular aren’t compatible with everything yet so would it be a bad idea to get one at this point? Thanks in advance

Does anyone know if you can bring in 32 credits from AP in addition to other college classes, or if they both add up to the 32? This is just a hypothetical btw, there’s no way I’m gonna be bringing in 8 AP’s lol.

Food insecurity (interview!!)
Hi!

I'm a journalism student and I'm working on a piece about food access and dining here at Northeastern. I would really love to share the perspective of someone who has benefited from the work of Mutual Aid (or other such organizations), so if you are willing to be interviewed please message me! (If it makes you more comfortable you can be anonymous). Thank you!

Course Time Changed After Registration?
I registered for POLS 3307 yesterday, which only has one section. The class was a 9:15 M W Th, which was great as I’m a fourth year and didn’t want to sign up for Friday classes. I went to look at my class registration today, and to my surprise the class has been changed to an 11:45 on Wednesday and Friday. 

It seems bizarre that they would change the days and times halfway through registration week, and it’s super frustrating because I would have chosen different classes if I’d known that I had to take a Friday class anyway. Even though it didn’t create a conflict for me, I imagine there were people that could not be signed up for the new time without a conflict. 

I’m curious - has this ever happened to anyone else? Any chance this is a system error? I’m not hopeful that it is, but I would be *so* happy if it was just a tech mistake, lmao.

Summer Housing
For summer housing on campus is it not possible to select your roommate(s)? I can’t find the option to do a rooming group like normal spring and fall housing. I should specify this is specifically for summer 2 but I’m curious about both.

can you take any summer 2 class online? like the eloquent presenter and intro to acting

Grad School Prep @ NEU
Hi everyone! I am a prospective freshman at NEU and plan on going to grad school. Considering that Northeastern is oriented towards preparing students for their careers straight out of undergrad, how well does NEU prepare students for grad school? Additionally, I’m interested in becoming a PA and was wondering how the pre PA program at this school is. Thank you!

National Merit Finalist Scholarship or Honors Scholarship?
I got the Honors scholarship for 30k per year, and I was wondering what the amount is for the NMF scholarship, as well as the GPA requirement/other requirements. I haven't yet named NEU as my top choice for the national merit scholarship, so I want to know more about its NMF scholarship before I do that.

Registration sucks
I have to be the unluckiest person ever when it comes to registration. Every time I make a plan ahead and even do research on all the professors and coordinate for no time conflicts and a balanced week. Then registration comes around and my time ticket is all the way at the end of fucking week. My sections get full changing up the plan and giving me worse professors than initially anticipated. Then I have to redo the whole week and plan for these new classes that I was not even supposed to be taking. I fill out the closed course petition form and hope I get in. If I get in then I have to reschedule all my classes because of time conflicts and if not we’ll I don’t take the class that I need to take. Like I swear I’m the fucking unluckiest person when it comes to registration. Anybody else get frustrated during registration times.

Seriously COS?
For those who don't know Biology Project Lab (BIOL2309) is a required course for nearly every major in the bio/behavioral neuro departments. It's a twice a week 3-hour lab class with 16 seats in each section. I was trying to register to take this class in the fall, only to see every single section is full. There are 144 seats offered and 122 people on wait-lists. I asked my advisor "Are they going to add more sections?" my advisor said "we are aware more people are trying to take the course than there are sections so we may add more sections" or something like that. Are you serious? Almost twice as many people want to take a required course across several majors and they "might" add more sections? It's incredibly irritating to hear a response like that. 

Additionally, there are only like 76 lab seats for microbiology lab and there are 110 lecture seats for microbiology. I asked my advisor about this as well and he "didn't know" if they were going to add more sections. It is extra infuriating because you can't even register for the lecture then take the lab another semester or wait to get overridden into a full section, because banner won't let you register for the lecture without the lab and your advisor can't even give you an override to do so because "you have to take them together." 

I really hope all this ends up working out for me and anyone else with similar problems later but what is even the point of giving me a time-ticket if I'm going to wait until the summer to register for half the classes I want/need to take?

CS 4120 (NLP) - How much work?
Hey, I'm planning out my schedule and am wondering how manageable Natural Language Processing is. Can anyone who's taken it speak to how difficult and time-consuming it is?

CS concentration workloads
Hello! I know it might have been asked before, but I've been looking into the CS concentrations that I have to choose by this semester's end.

So far I have 2 main choices: Human-Centered Computing and Systems. Both sound pretty interesting to me, from what I read on the course descriptions. I watched the video on Canvas talking about every concentration but didn't find much about the workload. I had trouble with CS classes in the past, so it's pretty important for me if I want a decent GPA.

Is there a large difference between each one's workload? Anything I should know about each one, that has not been said before? Anything on choosing professors? Thank you!

Would anyone be willing to talk to me about NU.in Boston, Greece, or Italy over Zoom?
I’m a business major and could really use the help in deciding my NU.in location. I want to get a feel of each location (from multiple perspectives hopefully) in a short zoom/discord meeting! Please respond if you were in any of these programs. Thank you.

Y’all please I need the help. I respond to PM’s really quick too.

How does the waitlist work?
If there's a class I want can I waitlist in it and sign up for 4 other classes and drop one of them if I get in the waitlist? or does the waitlist work some other way? 

Thanks!

Can we apply for multiple masters programs?

Is CSSH worth it?
Hi, I’m an admitted student to political science at northeastern and I’m wondering what the department is like? It seems like NEU has more of a focus on STEM so I’m kind of worried. Are there opportunities for social science majors on co-ops? 

I also was accepted at George Washington University in DC which would be great for poli sci. However, I don’t want to just attend a school because of the sole reason it’s in DC and I think NEU has stronger overall programs than GW if I want to switch out of poli sci into business or something. 

Overall, I feel like Northeastern checks more boxes - I prefer the campus of Northeastern, which I visited yesterday and loved and I’m really interested in co-op and study abroad. Also I think it’s nice that there’s actually a dining hall which GW doesn’t have (any more info on NEU dining would be great too)

If I go to northeastern I plan on doing a combined major at because I want to explore other interests. I don’t want to rule out the business field because I haven’t had much exposure to it, or maybe computer science. I think I have the type of temperament/chops that I could go into any field it’s just a matter of what I enjoy most. On the other hand if I went to GW I would have to double major which might be hard if my majors are unrelated. 

So I just went into depth on the pros and cons which didn’t really have to do with my og question sorry 😬

But I’d appreciate any thoughts about my upcoming decision and also some insight into CSSH. Sorry this was a little disjointed haha.

northeastern for introverts?
I am a prospective northeastern student and I have one concern. I have read that it can be a hard school for introverts because you are constantly surrounded by people and places are often crowded. Could any other introverts speak to this? Is it difficult to find space/time for yourself? 

Thank you.

OOD and Systems or OOD and Algorithms?
Rising sophomore, making my plan for fall 2021. Have an internship this summer and got told that taking OOD would be death, so switched it for an elective, and right now my plan is to take ood and systems in the fall. But now I'm hearing mixed advice about whether ood and systems is a better workload than ood and algorithms, reasoning for the first option is that algo is a lot of work with ood, reasoning for the second is that systems is programming heavy and would be difficult with already programming heavy ood. Anyone who actualy did/knows someone who did one or the other?

NUin Rooming
Hey guys! I'm doing NUin Greece this fall andI was just wondering how rooming worked in past years as well as if you can choose your roommates or if they are random. I'm pretty familiar with the rooming once students get back from NUin but I'm just wondering about what my actual fall semester in Greece will look like in regards to making friends and choosing roommates.

P.S. I've also heard that the grades you get in NUin don't count towards your GPA? Does anyone know if that's true?
