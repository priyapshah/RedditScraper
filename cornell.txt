LING 1101
Hello! Does anyone know anything about ling 1101? I know it's a 1000's class, but I've heard a lot of mixed reviews about it. Did anyone find it particularly hard or easy or just okay? Thank you!

Courses for learning proofs

Missing Wallet and Jacket
Last night I lost my jacket which had my wallet in it and was wondering if anyone has seen it. It is a long black winter jacket that has a small little emblem on one of the sleeves. I am not so worried about the jacket as I am my wallet which has things like my drivers license, credit cards and etc in it. Even if you haven't seen it, can someone please let me know some sources that I could contact to try to make this known and get my stuff back.

Any Okay-ish Science Classes? (For a Non-STEM guy)
Hello I’m an incoming Econ major. I’ve been looking over some possible science classes for my bio and physical sciences distribution, and I was wondering if any of you have suggestions for science courses I could take in my freshman year. For context, I absolutely hate chem and memorizing things about molecules etc etc so I’m planning on taking some astronomy classes throughout the 4 years. But I’m fine with any science classes that involve some math or logical reasoning.

For now, I’m planning on taking bioee 1610 (intro ecology and environment). Does any non-stem majors out there have any science classes they’ve enjoyed?

AP Credits - Engineering
Wondering if any COE students can answer this. I'll be attending Cornell (Engineering) in the fall, and I was looking through the Cornell Engineering website, but I wasn't 100% sure of what I was reading. Do Engineers get AP credit for AP Statistics and AP Spanish Language and Culture? It just wouldn't be worth it for me to take the exams if I don't get credit. Thanks!

FWS advice for an incoming 1st year
Hey everyone, Hope all is well.

So I am a soon to be Architecture major (AAP) at Cornell this fall. I know that course enrollment (at least for 1st years) is not available at the moment and as a result the fall 2021 FWS course options haven’t been posted. However I was looking at the previous year’s FWS course catalog and most of the FWS I found most interesting were usually ones based around Sci fi and/or video game world building/story telling. I was wondering if anyone on this sub has took/currently taking a similar FWS and what was your experience in the class? I am also wondering what are some other FWS that you would recommend for a person who enjoys reading, discussion, and projects but not the biggest fan of writing a ton? (I know I will have to write papers, I don’t really have a problem with that, I just prefer a less writing based class and more reading, discussion and projects). 

That’s all. Hope you guys have a nice rest your day.

Can Snapchat Sustain a Friendship? [Anonymous Survey]
Hello /r/Cornell! I am an undergraduate student at the University of Washington in Seattle and I’m running a study on how the use of the social media app Snapchat is influencing feelings of connection within friendships during the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, I’m looking to recruit college students from around the country who use Snapchat to take a **short, 15 minute, anonymous survey** about their experiences thus far in the pandemic in regard to how connected they are feeling to their friends.

If you’re interested, you may click the link below:

Would someone be able to tell me more about the information science major?
Hello! 

As the title says, I'm looking to find out more about the information science major 0: I don't really have any specific questions, but I'm interested in classes such as INFO 1300, INFO 2300 and the game design course. Currently I was intending to major in civil engineering (still a freshman though) but I discovered info sci is a thing. Web design and the User Experience concentration seems really interesting to me,but I want to find out more about the other concentration/CORE classes and what they all teach. Currently I'm torn between switching to Info Sci completely or following with a civil major + info sci minor.

Looking for an apartment mate for fall 2021
(Hi, please lmk if a post like this is against the rules and I will take it down.)

I am an incoming Master's student at Cornell for the fall 21 term. I am looking for an apartment mate who would potentially live with me in a 2 bedroom apartment. I usually would accept anyone as my roommate but I am bringing a golden retriever with me, so I want to preferably find someone who would love him just as much as I do. 

A little bit about me:
21 yrs old, M, have a car so if the apartment is further out, I can drive you to campus.

Please let me know if someone else is looking for a room and would be okay with a dog and we could talk a little bit more to see if we mesh well. Thanks!!

Some of y'all really need to revaluate how you treat professors
I know many professors have taken advantage of COVID to be shitty to students, but the same applies to students and professors. The amount of guilt-tripping and complaints over every little inconvenience is so embarrassing. Right now i'm specifically referring to the student who wrote an essay in the VIEN1104 EdStem about how unfair it was that they could not go back on their quiz and that they were "denied the right to submit answers they were confident in" despite their being a 60-minute time limit for an open-book 20 question multiple choice quiz (literally the answers were word for word from the lecture). The teachers in this class are sooo fucking nice and there's literally 10% extra credit (yes, you can get a 110% in VIEN1104 and the class is already straightforward). Students already complained about ATTENDING LECTURE so they doubled attendance points and reduced the # of lectures. I cringe the way some of you talk to TAs and Professors in office hours and interrupt class because you think a stressful semester excuses any individual accountability. You are not owed a free A this semester because of COVID. Shoutout to my one professor who responded to a student who interrupted saying "i forgot about the quiz this week,  we need more announcements about module quizzes" with "I am not your mother". There's complaints relating to student's general lack of organization and preparation that they're now putting on professors and blaming on the burden of COVID, in situations that there is no reason to do so. The way you complain would make it seem as if you are in the hospital awaiting a lung transplant for your COVID diagnosis. OBVIOUSLY there needs to be some level of understanding about accommodating increased stress, but this doesn't mean we just obliterate the standards that exist in any normal semester. Shut the fuck up, get a planner, and do your work, thank you!!

Insecurity re: major
I’m an ILR major and enjoying myself more or less with my studies. With that said, I can’t help but think I’m slacking off and inferior to the swaths of engineering/pre-med students I’m surrounded by. Maybe this is just a manifestation of imposter syndrome but I honestly do kinda think ILR is just a lesser degree. I hear a lot of jokes at ILR’s expense at how it’s a joke, absurdly easy, etc. 
I would write these off as just jokes but then I read stuff like [this which apparently shows ILR having a significantly higher acceptance rate ](https://blog.collegevine.com/easiest-ivy-league-schools-to-get-into/). I’ve considered transferring colleges or loading up on “harder” minors as a way to justify to myself that what I’m studying in college is ‘legit’. 

What’s more is that, I am not a native of New York State, which means I do not pay in-state tuition for my degree. And a part of me feels as though a not-insignificant reason I was even let into Cornell was so that they would charge me more (I get some financial aid, but still) 

Does any other ILR major feel the way I feel? What do other students feel about ILR?

I'm planning to fly out at the end of May by taking an Ourbus up north and I'm not sure whether I should buy a second ticket to be safe and get my luggage secured onboard or whether I should risk it. Appreciate any input.

World War Cornell (Hearts of Iron 4: MP game Sunday)
Morning,   
So me and several friends usually host a game of EU4 every Sunday at around 7:30 or 8:30 to around 11. Last week we finished our game with a resounding British Victory (Do not fact check me on that what so ever). Since Leviathan just came out and is extremely buggy, we are taking a break this week (and potentially next to play a game of HOI4). 

If you would like to join, join our discord ([https://discord.gg/HBjbckR2](https://discord.gg/HBjbckR2)) and message in #general that you're interested in a specific nation. 

I am pretty sure we currently have a:   
Russia (Me)  
Germany (J)  
UK ()  
USA/Italy(IDK again)

Germany and Russia would love to have seconds to help them with the micro but China and Japan along with potentially Italy/Romania up for grabs too. 

Hope to see you there

What to do if we haven't received Financial Aid notice yet?
It appears that Cornell's financial aid office has been running behind to get these sent out and I am particularly concerned for that reason.

I already have submitted an enrollment deposit extension request - so everything that I can do for Cornell has been done.

For now, while I am waiting for the release of my aid, what do I do regarding other schools that I may be looking at? Should I be submitting my enrollment deposit at one of these schools and wait until Cornell gets back to me or should I be contacting their undergraduate admissions department and asking them for an enrollment deposit extension as well?

I am particularly concerned about depositing somewhere and it being "binding," since there have been scenarios where students have lost admission to both schools - however this kind of confuses me because of how the waitlist process works.

Thanks

Edit: I contacted one school who's deadline is May 1st, and they have said that the furthest they can extend the deadline to was May 3rd

Unable to traverse North Campus
This morning, as I left RPCC with breakfast, I encountered a dilemma. Previously, the construction workers had left a couple of detours for pedestrians to pass through their site. However, this morning, those detours were gone. There was legitimately no way for me to walk back down North Campus from RPCC unless I took a wide detour by Hasbrouck. Thankfully, a few construction workers let me cross through the path they were currently constructing with rocks.

It's getting a bit ridiculous now. I try not to complain about the construction because they've gotta do what they've gotta do, but when it gets to the point where everyone trying to get from point A to point B cannot do so (and trust me, I was not the only person looking around stranded and confused), something has to give. There's no place on North where you can walk without dodging pesky rocks, construction cones, or trucks bringing materials. Can we please get some respite in the last few weeks of the semester?

I even saw them tearing up the grass behind CKB as I walked. All I could do was continue walking and shake my head in disbelief.

Construction will be the death of me
I am writing this at 7:45 am, a little after the time I was abruptly woken up on North today by the loudest, most obnoxious parade of sounds I have ever heard.  Construction must have started at the crack of dawn this morning, and ever since I have not been able to sleep due to the constant barrage of construction workers yelling obscenities, machines whirring, the high-pitched backup alarms blaring, loud clanging from who knows what, and excavators dumping large objects, making loud thud noises.

This makes it impossible to sleep. I shut my windows but it does absolutely no good.  I’ve put up with living on a construction site all year on North, which has been extremely terrible due to maskless dudes hanging around smoking near our buildings, the sidewalks constantly being muddy and gross because they’re always being dug up, the vomit-worthy anti-aesthetic, and of course the unforgivable noise.

Will all this construction be worth it because North will look beautiful next year?  I’m sure.  But it’s incredibly frustrating that this is coming at the cost of the well being of many students.  Staying up late working on homework can no longer be compensated by sleeping in because the construction disallows that.

Does anyone know where to file a formal complaint?  I feel I’ve been pretty tolerant being woke up morning after morning but this is getting beyond intolerable.  Thanks for listening to my little rant :P

I’ve finally internalized that grades don’t matter.
I’ve always heard this when I freak out about my grades and then specify that I’m aiming to enter the software engineering industry after graduation. “Your GPA doesn’t matter as long as it isn’t a disaster.” “If it’s low, just leave it off - recruiters seldom care.” “Experience matters far more than grades.” I’ve heard this, and from time to time I’ve even understood this, but up until this point, it has done nothing to curb my anxiety. 

Until now, for some reason. Perhaps it’s my experience with CS 4780, whose exams I struggle with but whose projects I love. Or perhaps it’s my project team and research lab involvements, where I can handle challenging projects without disaster. Or perhaps it’s the fact that my friends (and even organizations sometimes, though that’s another story) ask me for advice and guidance all the time despite having higher grades. 

Or most likely, it’s because I asked myself why I care so much. I care so much not because of the perceived weight grades have on my future, but because of the perceived weight grades had on my past. It’s nothing but a habit. I panic because I trained myself to panic back when it mattered. Grades mattered a hell of a lot more in high school than they do now, and they were also one of the only big things I had to worry about as a teenager. 

And now, I have realized that I simply can’t focus on one number to tell myself how well I’m doing or how capable I am. Saying that sentence without context would sound absurd, precisely because it is. I listed a ton of things above that can reassure me of my competence. For the first time in a long time, without reservation, I feel like I can tell myself that I am competent, that I am capable of sustained growth, and that I am winning. In fact, I feel like I can tell the whole world (or just you folks on this subreddit for now) and not worry about being told otherwise because I can prove it without rattling off my GPA. 

I’m sharing this here for two reasons. First, because I hope that my little epiphany here can inspire a similar epiphany within you if this is something you deal with as well. Second, because it’s likely that I’ll forget this again and will have to reread my own post to remind myself of what’s important. 

Thanks for sticking around and reading what I had to say. Two more weeks of classes, we’ve got this!

Experience as a Bio Major (CAS)?
still can’t decide to commit... One day left...
But! I was admitted for bio in CAS and hoping to concentrate in neurobiology. 

What’s it like as a bio major at Cornell? 

Are the classes overwhelmingly big beyond intro classes? 

Is it difficult to form relationships with professors due to the size of the class/if they’re only teaching to get grant money for their own research? Or do grad students/TAs do most of the teaching? 

Will I have to be very very self motivated in terms of advising and academic support, or is there many ways to get help (accessible office hours)? 

I am deciding between Georgetown and Cornell, and I think I prefer smaller class sizes where I can interact more with professors (why I’ve decided to not commit to schools like UCLA/UW), but is Cornell more similar to a UC education because it’s larger?

Study Abroad Possibilities?

CS Tests
This year is my first time in a computer science class and I absolutely despise the tests. Given the nature of CS, I think tests are pretty unnecessary since projects do most of the heavy-lifting in getting kids to learn coding. This quality distinguishes CS from other STEM coursework, in which ordinary tests are better methods of getting students to learn and tracking progress.

My biggest complaint about CS tests is *handwriting* code for 1.5 hours. It baffles me that my computer science knowledge is primarily evaluated on paper. Last I checked, computer science requires a computer, not just a pencil. I understand that success on paper could translate to proficiency on a computer, but handwriting code removes the trial and error process associated with coding on a computer. Computers give you the chance to instantly test your own code, fix mistakes, and identify what code works. This process is eliminated when handwriting code. I think CS classes should move away from forcing students to handwrite code.

Bio Lab venting
Ok, I just gotta vent & I want advice on if there’s anything I can do as well. I’m an asian American student from ATL, and the week of the shooting / night of was really really hard because it was very close to home, & caused a lot of anxiety and panic. I had a huge assignment due for my Bio Lab class, and a prelim the night before, so I hadn’t started as much as I wanted. Anyways, I did the assignment and got the answers right but did it a different way. (EDIT y’all i did NOT cheat it was coding, and you can do different codes to get the same very basic answer I did NOT cheat lmao) I get it back and my grade goes from a 97 to a 67 in the class. It destroyed my otherwise amazing grade, and after doing the math if I get 100% on everything I can get a C+. I emailed the prof explaining everything and his response was verbatim, “I find it concerning that you failed to do any introspection on why you did so poorly, and instead applied it to other external circumstances. You are free to drop the class if you so please,”.... this man (who is yt) called a mass shooting and hate crime external circumstances I should have planned for...? I’m just so frustrated cause A) I dont like opening up to random strangers about my mental health or struggles and B) they send out so many emails saying they want to help us and are here for us etc... I just needed to vent to students who may be going through the same stuff so yeah

High/low rises and Donlon should be demolished
It’s unfortunate, but these dorms need to go. They have no architectural merit, the facilities are shit, and they’re possibly the worst looking dorms in the Ivy League, second only to some of Dartmouth’s.

At least the new dorms (Morrison hall and the others) are modern and new and look passably like they’re trying to integrate into the Ithaca landscape. They’re not the best, and I wish Cornell had gone for dorms more similar to Dickson, Risley, or Balch, but they’re not ugly.

It’s literally an embarrassment to Cornell that these dorms still exist. We demolished the U-Halls, so I hope Martha is brave enough to demolish the old modernist dorms, too.

Looking for 3rd roommate in collegetown apartment for next year
Our third friend is going to another school and we are looking for someone to take their place on the lease. Here is our description from cornlet.com, see the full post with pictures below:

https://www.cornlet.com/listing/607f48eabe763a00172f6faa

**Description:**

About the apartment:

Located  in the quieter area above collegetown. Almost as close to campus as collegetown, nothing is ever too far- Duffield is a 10min walk. The apartment has two large bedrooms and one LARGE bedroom. The unit is the cozy second floor of a small two story building. There is a kitchen, dishwasher, kitchen table, couch,  nice common area. The two of us will stock the kitchen with tools/utensils but you can bring stuff too. We have a deep fryer and will fry anything with you. Can do trips to wegmans/walmart/food easily by car. We are bringing a TV for movies/hanging out/whatever (I hope you like IKEA...). Parking is available for rent nearby.  Free street parking exists too.  The one downside is laundry, which is available but a bit annoying (we think). We pay for heat, hot water, electricity, gas, and internet. Could be convinced to get a window AC unit.

About us:

We are two MechE grad students looking for a third person to join us next year- our friend left for another school. We aren't in a relationship, just friends. We are both respectful and neat/clean. Sleep schedules vary a lot for both of us but we can be quiet when you need it. We might have friends over and you might too- have fun, be nice, don't get noise complaints and we are good. Some things we like, if it means anything to you: cooking, rock climbing, music, video games, archery. Would be cool if we could all be friends, though if you would  rather just do your thing that's fine by us.

DM me here or respond to the post on cornlet if you are interested or have questions!

But now that I’m thinking about it, I have realized that I always feel ‘less than’ in my family because I didn’t go into stem, and especially with my peers since I feel like everyone has ‘harder’ work than me even though we study for about the same time.

Hello!

I'm just confused about the new Phys 2213 guidelines. It says in the first image that for fall 2021 it will not have a lab component, but if you only completed Phys 1112 prior to these changes, the fall version will still include a lab. Does this mean that the non-lab version of Phys 2213 will start in Spring 2022?

Nuanced answer to: I don't get how people with better grades than me ask me for help
Your grade in a particular class is related to at least two different bell curves.  For this answer I'll describe the two most obvious curves as: The bell curve that describes how much you know and the bell curve that describes how much of what you know you can use on a test.

Some people rely almost entirely on the fact that they can crush the bell curve that describes how efficiently they can pick up material and apply what they just learned on a test.  They "sort of" don't need to study.  They do the original homework to get the idea but then just rock every bit of their understanding out on the prelim with minimal studying, maybe just a few questions to others in the class like "I don't get".  This sounds like a magical power but it usually comes with a couple downsides.  The ability to pick things up quickly often keeps you from bothering to actually learn the material in a way that allows you to retain it long term.  This shows up in courses that have prereqs and to a lessor extent on finals.  An even bigger downside is that eventually they get to material that is difficult enough so they can't pick it up quickly AND THEN THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO and their grades suffer.

Other people rely on really learning the material to the point where they understand all the nuances and never forget it.  (Well, OK that may be overselling how much effort this group really puts in.)  Often they drive themselves to do this because they feel that they can't do timed exams or are just somehow inferior to those who pick "easy" things up quickly.  **The reality is that, most often, they are neither inferior nor incapable of doing timed exams.**  (Not trying to imply they are great at timed tests on the scale of people at Cornell but that isn't any sort of normal scale.) These people just need to modify how they study to make it more representative of how they will be tested.

Basically, this means that they need to spend less time slowly going through the material and checking their notes/answers to make sure they don't miss anything important and more time testing themselves in a time limited manner to mimic a test .  NOT LOSING NEGATIVE SIGNS THE FIRST TIME THROUGH A PROBLEM (AND OTHER SILLY MISTAKES) IS A SKILL THAT YOU CAN PRACTICE.  Also your grade is more likely to swing on being able to rock through the bunch of problems YOU KNOW WILL BE ON THE TEST quickly so you have time to struggle with the last hard problem that separates the As from the Bs than it is to swing on you happening to study so much more than everyone else that you know enough of the material in the grey areas to happen to have information everyone else doesn't.  The whole point of homework is learning to struggle, use that practice on prelims.

To mash these ideas together, since you are at Cornell, it is unlikely that you aren't in places on each of these bell curves where you can't use both the how much you know and the quickly you learn curves to your advantage now that they have been explicitly described to you.  Maybe more importantly, you need to realize that relying on either one alone is going to limit your growth at Cornell.

Good luck

Grade Deflation & Recruiting (Cornell Engineering)
1. Incoming freshman to the College of Engineering and I'd like to affiliate into CS. I've heard that Cornell Engineering especially suffers from grade deflation and that the median GPA for Engineering/CS is 2.7. Is that true and if so, how bad exactly is it? What's the median GPA? How likely is it to get a GPA around 3.7ish or at least 3.5? (I'm a pretty hardworking person and I'll definitely put in the effort but I'm just wondering if it's even possible).
2. I want to get a Master's Degree in CS as well. I'm aware Cornell has a M. Eng program, how good is that compared to a regular MS at a good school? Like are they valued the same by employers? Also, kinda going back to the GPA question, will I be able to have a high enough GPA with time to do research & internships in order to get into a good MS program?
3. Is Cornell a good place to be recruited/get internship opportunities, as in do companies like recruiting from Cornell bc location-wise it's pretty far from a lotta companies in the bay area so are a variety of companies (from startups to the big ones) interested?  basically, is it helpful to go to Cornell in terms of recruiting?
4. Is it hard to enroll in classes? like is it common to be waitlisted or even not able to take classes you want/need?
5. Is Cornell worth the cost? And if so, in what ways?

Thanks!

I’m an incoming MPS in management grad student this fall looking to break into IB after the one year program. Just wondering if there’s any career resource I should be utilizing(such as Alumni for referral, etc) and just overall suggestions on the recruitment process is greatly appreciated since I’ll be on campus end of August. I’m afraid that I wont be able to network and then go through the application process by the time I get to the campus. 

Thanks!

Networks I after Networks II
I'm looking for an easy (possibly gpa boost) 4 credit liberal distribution course for engineering and I was thinking about INFO 2040 (Networks I)

Will INFO 2040 will be a breeze if I've already taken CS 4852 (Networks II)? Or did INFO 2040 cover a bunch of unrelated topics from CS 4852

Thanks!

Is it too late to change number of research credits?
Up until this week, I’ve averaged 6-9 hours a week in the lab which correctly correlates to 2 research credits. 

I just finished the project I was working on and now my post-doc has assigned me to an entirely new project of his which averages 10-15 hours a week with 10 hours a week being a minimum (he explicitly said this). 

Now I feel like 10-15 hours a week should be more on the side of 3 research credits. 

Is it possible to change my research credit hours from 2 to 3 this late in the semester? (BIOG 4990 for those curious)

Thanks in advance.

Social scene at Cornell
I’m currently deciding between Cornell and another college, and was wondering what the social scene is like at Cornell. What do you do off of campus besides nature stuff (skiing, hiking, etc.)? Do you find that there is a lack of options in Ithaca?  Do you think that the student body is generally introverted or extroverted?

Easy HumEc classes?
Anyone know of any easy A classes I could take from HumEc? NS would be mostly preferred. 

Easy as in open notebook exams or straight out of slides. Minimal work would be preferred and easy to understand. It should be pretty chill along with all my other crazy classes.

Thanks

Transfer Option and IB scores
Hello Cornell people, I have been given a transfer option ILR which I definitely plan on attending.  Also I am in the IB program, and am worried I might not get my diploma because of 1 test. So I was wondering:   


1. Does Cornell ask for your scores after you graduate? 
2. If I fail 1 IB exam and do not get my diploma , will my option be rescinded  ? 
3. (Not relevant) Which foreign language do you guys recommend? I have heard that Russian is really great, but  have not heard much about Chinese.
--------------------------------------------------
CS vs InfoSci
So, I always thought I wanted to major in CS but starting at Cornell kind of made me feel like it wasn’t genuinely what I wanted. 

I’m taking CS 1110 right now and I honestly don’t really enjoy the class. The assignments are kind of fun but I feel like since I’m not really enjoying the class I might not like CS as a major. Would y’all say that’s true?

I was considering switching out to Info Sci. What courses would y’all recommend I take in fall of sophomore year to help me decide between CS and InfoSci?

“The SA is useless, and no one cares”
 \[Reposting with permission without my name\]

Since entering Cornell, there has been a recurring theme of SA drama. Whether it was BDS, disarmament, freedom of speech, fossil fuel divestment, or the many other dramas that have occurred in the SA, there has always been a prioritization of national issues over campus ones in the Student Assembly. Yes, it is important to act as a megaphone for the opinions of the student body, but in my opinion the Student Assembly has a history of prioritizing headlines and national issues over the direct needs of students. I think this is why you might not care about the SA, and believe me, I am with you in knowing that the SA has very little power.

But they do have some power. They have the power to allocate the SAFC. They have the power to change the student activity fee. They have the power to speak to the administration on behalf of students and they have done this successfully in the past. Recently however, the “speak to the administration” has become “send the administration policies we know they will reject”.

I think this problem is created by students not voting in elections. When a small number of students with strong opinions participate in the election (< 10% of the undergrad population), then that small number of students’ opinions will be overrepresented in the SA. If instead, many students voted, I believe that the SA would begin to better represent all students, and more importantly address direct campus student issues first, before issuing statements on national ones. So, instead of meming about how the SA is useless, I implore you to vote in the elections so that the SA regains the respect of students, and represents ALL students, not just the 10% who have been voting in the past. If you are interested in voting, you can go to [https://vote.assembly.cornell.edu/](https://vote.assembly.cornell.edu/).
--------------------------------------------------
At this point, I feel like the constant SA posts add nothing to the conversation & that this sub is becoming an anti-SA circle-jerk with no good takes
*Title should not say no “good” takes, but no “new good” takes*

I wrote this as a comment on another post, but I think it needs its own post:

NGL, I dislike the way our SA operates strongly, but I really think the reddit population hates SA much more than the general student body does.

People I interact with generally: a) support SA completely

b) support the measures but not the candidates 

c) support the sentiment and intentions behind SA decisions or

d) as /u/_Spectre08_ stated, don’t even care about anything SA related at all

I think reddit is kind of detached from people on campus. Every post on reddit was about how people should stop partying during COVID (which I agree with 100%) and yet a lot of students went to parties and traveled. Everyone here hates the SA reps and yet the same people keep winning. At this point, the SA bashing is just circle-jerking (justified circle-jerking, but a circle-jerk nonetheless). Anti-SA posts are just easy ways to get karma and there’s no actual discussion anymore

Questions from a Prospective Freshman
Cornell is one of my top two choices and I have some urgent last-minute questions to ask before the commitment deadline. I would greatly appreciate it if someone could answer!

1. Would it be possible for me to get a single room as a freshman? I would be willing to pay extra. I would be okay with living off-campus too (if it's allowed for first years ofc). This is a dealbreaker for me.
2. What is the political culture like? Is it far left or moderate left? 
3. How are the mental health services? Do your parents find out if you use them? I am a bit worried because so far on this sub I've heard that the mental health services are bad/lacking
4. How is the culture around mental health at Cornell? I've heard horror stories about students jumping off the bridges
5. Should I bring a car to campus? Is the public transportation good?
6. How are the class sizes? 
7. Do you feel safe on campus? Especially if you're a woman?
8. Does the bad weather detract a lot from your experience? 
9. Does the isolation of Ithaca/kinda being in the middle of nowhere detract a lot from your experience?
10. Is Cornell actually depressing and stressful or is that just a stereotype?

I also have some questions specific to the CS program:

1. In general, is the program more theoretical or practical? Does it prepare you well for going straight to industry after graduation?
2. Is there grade deflation?
3. Is the student culture collaborative or competitive?
4. Do AP credits transfer over well for CS students or are they useless?
5. How hard is it to get into CS clubs? Are they super competitive?
6. How is the workload? I've heard that CS at Cornell is extremely difficult 
7. Is it difficult to get internships due to Cornell's isolated location?

I am sorry if I played into misconceptions/stereotypes (and please feel free to correct me for that), I just want to get input from current students before making my decision :)

I don't get how people with better grades than me ask me for help
I share a bunch of classes with people in my cohort/major. I'm quite sure they have better grades than me. I fuck up on timed exams pretty often. Long take-home exams are fine but I don't get those often.  I consistently make stupid mistakes when under pressure or doing long calculations. idk why. 

But when it comes to homework or concepts from class these people ask me for help, ask me to check their answers, ask to see my work etc. I usually start things early and spend some solid effort on assignments. Then choke on exams. 

I don't get it. Do I even understand the material? Then why am I choking?? christ

PhD Placement for Information Science Majors
I'm going to be a rising sophomore in CALS for InfoSci and I really want to get a PhD in CS/ML.

Should I consider an internal transfer to CS in CAS or CoE if I want to pursue a PhD in CS or can I just do research w CS professors as an IS major and still be a strong candidate for competitive PhD CS programs?

Advice for job searching & performing effectively once job is found?
I'm applying for full-time positions in my home city since I'm graduating this year. I worked a job last summer as a Business Analyst in a fairly large corporation and a Policy Analyst the summer before that. 

The Business Analyst job shattered all my confidence. I received no formal training/orientation; I was to be given tasks and ask questions when needed. Cool no problem. So I ask my supervisor questions and he answers the direct question... but never explains the reasoning even when I ask the why. I voice it's hard to independently make decisions on the fly or develop intuition iwith no foundational context to leverage. He acknowledges my concern but his explanations are all along the lines of "we just know what to do". 

I'm weary at this point but do my best to pull knowledge from his smattering of isolated answers, my past experiences, the internet and company documents. I never felt I finished a task comprehensively. The feedback I always got: you missed doing XYZ so ask more questions if you don't know. The problem is XYZ are extremely specific things to the company that would never end up answers to questions I'd organically think to ask. XYZ is so drastically out of my scope of awareness. And the answers you give me sir are the vaguest one-liners. Again, I tell him I lack support and provide examples of when I felt this way. I ask for a brief "stuff you should know for completing this" when he gives me tasks so I can actually deliver value and be efficient. He validates this at first but ends up saying full-time permanent positions after grad requires figuring stuff out on your own so I should improve at it because he's busy. I get that reality but I can't produce knowledge out of thin air. It'd be faster to give me a summary of key points at the start than deal with my badgering and fill my gaps afterwards.

The kicker is he said I did a relatively good job for a summer student employee when I constantly felt lost or inconsistent with my work. 

**tl;dr:** I guess in my expectations for future jobs, I carry the feeling of instability, having no support and playing desperate catch-up like my last job. The whole process of job-searching feels like a hazy frenzy. I see jobs I think I'm qualified for but some listed job requirements in the posting indicate tasks I "should've" learned in school but I don't remember or didn't do well in. If they assume I should know how to do these things right away, I'm fucked.

Actual Issues that SA Candidates Should Talk About
 All of the SA candidates seem to be advocating for reduced costs yet none of them have addressed the root problem – administrative bloat. Administrative bloat in higher education has become an increasingly severe problem (see [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinesimon/2017/09/05/bureaucrats-and-buildings-the-case-for-why-college-is-so-expensive/)), and is especially bad at Cornell due to its decentralization. Each school has dozens of deans, most of whom contribute very little yet earn 6 figure salaries. For instance, most schools here have their own office of diversity and inclusion, each boasting half a dozen staff. I am all for diversity, but if you want to promote diversity (and not just racial diversity, but socio-economic diversity), then reducing the cost of tuition and improving financial aid should be the prerogative. 

Another problem is this school’s propensity for overpriced and showy construction. Klarman Hall cost nearly $900 per square foot, and the new arts library cost roughly $830 per square foot. To provide context, Upson Hall, which was built at roughly the same time as Klarman, cost only $250 per square foot. Why is the university lavishing so much money on opulent construction projects when tuition is increasing at twice the rate of inflation? 

Not to mention the administration is planning on expanding the size of the student body in the coming years without a corresponding increase in facilities or faculty size.

Also, last thing, can we get rid of Cornell Dining’s monopoly? Other schools allow outside vendors to operate on their campuses (e.g., McDonalds, Subway, etc.) which, I think, results in overall lower prices.
--------------------------------------------------
CS 4410 vs CS 4414
Which one should I take? I’m nervous because 4410 is being taught by a new professor, so the workload and assignments could be totally different. I was also pretty weak in 3410 for context.
--------------------------------------------------
What does the SA do?
I feel like people have their platforms and everything, but I’ve been hearing free printing for the past 3 years (I’m a senior) and I think this is the first time it actually changed (I think). I don’t really print, but anyways I never really understood if they have an actual say, or if it’s more of a role that brings up ideas that students might like, while the board of trustees (or whoever) just ultimately do whatever they want, not really caring about what the SA really says. So yea if someone could fill me in on what they do and what impacts/changes they’ve made that would be amazing!

@CS people, do y’all like what you’re doing?
Does coding bring you joy? Would you think about/do things related to CS in your free time? Do you find CS fun? To what extent do you love what you do?

2. Make an app where you can find the nearest bathroom, and make it like yelp where you have 'bathroom reviews'
3. Terrace and Trillium accept Meal Swipes
4. Figure out why Terrace/Trillium cost half as much as a meal swipe 
5. Free Laundry

Honestly, if we could get even one of these, I would be so happy

Hi everyone! With the good weather, I have been starting to take my dog to campus. However, she got pretty hungry on our walk today. I was wondering if any dining halls or other eateries on campus had food for dogs? I was kind of thinking about the Starbucks puppuccino. Thanks :)

Warning: Do NOT take MUSIC 1105
This course presents itself as an introduction into music theory, perfect for someone like me who has played musical instruments but wants to learn more of the theory side of things. 

However, the courses content and organization has made it an extremely stressful class. First, the work deadlines are seemingly capriciously assigned, with endless amounts of assignments due at times such as 1pm, 5pm and 9pm with no clear pattern or late submissions. Most of the assignments are also graded busywork, meaning that you spend most of your time memorizing things like harmonic frequencies that is almost completely irrelevant to most musicians. Finally, lectures have no clear structure and lecture materials/handouts rarely fully encompass everything you need to know. 

As a cherry on top, I also spent some time this semester struggling with mental health; however, the professor was extremely unhelpful with letting me try to catch up. 

tl;dr In MUSIC 1105, you spend more time stressing over assignments/grades than learning useful music theory. Don't take it. If you do, treat it like a 4+ credit class.

How to get more wellness days ?
Wrong answers only

how's CS 6820
\^
--------------------------------------------------
How is this even remotely okay
"Enjoy your wellness days!" yeah right. Glad I spent them not doing homework (like we're supposed to) just so every fucking teacher on the planet can just slam us with deadlines all week. I have a CS1112 exercise due Wednesday, I've been working on the CS project 5 for upwards of 6 hours over the past few days due Thursday, a problem set for my ENGRI due Friday, and a 10 page long final draft for AEP 4840 due Friday.  I feel like classes are just treating the wellness days as lost time that we need to catch up for and this is just outright awful. Again, where the fuck is the admin who supposedly "care" about our mental health so much, and why have they yet again managed to make this semester somehow even more miserable than normal? At this point, I would've rather just had another normal week so I wouldn't have had an excuse to procrastinate when clearly that's being punished right now.

Please help me pick a school (I have three days to decide)
Hey Guys! I have no idea where I am going to college and I would love your help. I feel like the best way to decide what school to attend is to ask current students about their experience. I would love for you all to be as candid with me as possible. I have no idea where to commit and I only have three days.

Some background information: I want to major in **political science/government** on the **pre-law track**.

Some things to consider:

**UF**

* Instate tuition
* Bright futures scholarship
* Close to home

**Carleton**

* Would cost the same as UF to attend.
* Smallest school from all my options
* Seems like an adorable/collaborative school
* The school I know the least about

**Cornell University**

* Most expensive option but my family can afford it without too much of a burden
* Least ideal location since it’s in the middle of nowhere

If you attend any of these schools, I would love your genuine opinion on whether I should attend. If you would like, I would love it if you touched on any of the questions below.

1.)  Is the school fun?

2.)  Is it competitive/cutthroat or collaborative?

3.)  Are the students happy?

4.)  Is there grade deflation or inflation?

5.)  Is it difficult to maintain high grades?

6.)  What are your least favorite things and most favorite things?

7.)  How is the social scene?

8.)  Number one complaint?

9.)  Class sizes?

***Thank you for all your help.***

Can I have courses charge anything other than the bursar?
So I've gotten into arguments with my parents every semester about what classes I should and should not be taking. I know they won't agree with the classes I want to take next semester.

Usually this wouldn't be a problem since they don't check my student center/transcript, but since the classes I want to take all have course fees that get billed to the bursar, it's not like they won't see it. Any ideas about how I can get around this/has anyone had courses directly billed to their personal account before?

Prelim Material
Am I the only who thinks it's kind of wild that the we're going to be learning some of the material for the 2800 prelim the day before the 2800 prelim? Like it was weird to try and study over the wellness days, it's weird to try and study now because I literally don't know all the practice problems and stuff that I've been given. It's totally within the prof's right to do that ig, but I wish she had just left some of that stuff for the final instead of trying to fit it into this prelim :/

Why do profs need to teach anymore?
If profs recorded their lectures this year, couldn’t all classes be asynchronous and we just watch 2-3 recordings per week? Obviously it would be so boring but why teach in-person/synchronously if you can use your recordings for the next 3 generations?

Note: obviously I don’t want this to happen next year just wondering lolz xd roflmao gang gang

Course planning/ major path
Hi everyone, I’m having a conundrum regarding planning my courses for next semester, and more generally, which major I want to pick. I was originally intending on studying CS but I’m frankly not really interested in it at all. However, I know the job prospects are good so I guess I’m still going to go for the major. I’m thinking about adding a double major in sociology or gov — how doable is this? That’s where my true passions lie, but I’m a bit worried about job prospects if I majored in sociology/gov by itself.

If I take this path though, I’m a bit concerned that I won’t be able to dedicate enough time to both subjects, leading to a situation where I end up with mediocre results across the board. What do you think? How can I find a balance between what I love (while still considering factors like job security/salary)?

With regards to CS, if I’m not really enjoying the curriculum at all now (2110 and 2800), will it only get worse?

About the SA Emails and How Candidates Get Net IDs
Many people here have asked about if the emails are allowed. The short answer is yes. I agree the emails are really annoying but they're allowed and don't violate any campaigning rules (I checked). 

As for how they get net ids for the emails, candidates I've talked with said they either know the people personally, know them from class, or from social media. Also, you can type in any student's name into a Cornell gmail and their net id will most likely show up.

Unfortunately, when one candidate starts emailing people, it creates a trickle down effect where others do it as well because of concerns about voter outreach (which is dumb imo, I've NEVER been happy to get an email from an SA candidate). Additionally, some people encourage candidates to do it because they think it will get more people to vote for the candidate. I don't personally know a single person who likes this practice, and I am less inclined to vote for those who do it, regardless of politics.

Mandarin, Spanish, Japanese, or ASL for CAS foreign language credit???
I’m rlly stuck on what to choose for my foreign language credit for CAS next semester.  Right now, I’m looking at CS 2110 + GOVT 3032 + MATH 1120, and a foreign language credit.  I’m a government and computer science double major.

My dad wants me to take mandarin because it’s the “language that makes money” and it would look good on my transcript.  Chinese is pretty cool tbh, but I’m more worried about course load and complexity for mandarin rather than its language.  I originally took CHIN 1101 for one week last semester and then dropped it because I wanted an easy first semester.

I’m Hispanic, took two years of middle school in Spanish, and my mother speaks Spanish although I don’t know much Spanish. 

Japanese I guess because I have some interest in Japanese culture? Aside from that, nothing much.

ASL not for the interest but rather because I suck at learning languages I just want a chill class for foreign language credit.

A different perspective on the SA situation
*Disclaimer: this post discusses sensitive topics, but I would really appreciate if you read the whole post through before commenting. I think it’s easy to jump to conclusions of what I’m saying if you only read a paragraph or so (something I do all the time so no judgments), but please bear with me. If it’s too long, just read the first sentence of the bullets and you’ll get the gist*. 

I generally like this sub, but I think a lot of people have a limited perspective on SA. I think many people miss the biggest elephant in the room- that a lot of the SA issues have to do with race. Not necessarily people being explicitly hateful or racist, but different lived experiences of race, in my opinion, cause 80% of the problems with SA.

**POC Experience at Cornell**  
*tl;dr: In general, a significant amount of Cornell students feel like outsiders because of their cultural/racial background, so they isolate from the core Cornell community and create subcultures*
- The transition to Cornell is rough for a lot of POC, and students often feel isolated from campus (and more broadly, also from the nation)
    - Despite the fact that Cornell students are generally awesome and accepting, students of color experience a huge cultural shift when they enter Cornell, especially POC from working class and/or predominantly non-white areas. A lot of things that are “normal” for other Cornell students are huge adjustments for many other students, such as the food you eat, the language and tone you use, the culture that’s relevant, etc. Real talk, I didn’t have *a single white person in my class for most of my life* until I transferred to a PWI that was mostly white
    - Besides culture shock, many students are also trying to cope with what I’ll call their “racial awakening”, where they realize that the color of their skin will affect a lot of different facets of their life. I think most POC seriously start considering their race in their late teens, and they start becoming aware that people will discriminate against them just because of what they look like. And certain policies really do only affect people like them, so politics becomes personal. Students feel powerless about their own lives and from personal experience, certain events just make you feel like there’s no place for you in the world
    - And yeah, unfortunately the bulk of racism happens on campus goes completely under the radar. I have friends who no joke worked with Cornell dining staff that would mock people’s accents and accuse black people of stealing, even going as far as to tell workers to watch out for the black kids. 
- As a result of this feeling of isolation, subcultures of minority groups develop. I can only speak for the black community, but there is a “black Cornell experience” that is very different from a typical Cornell experience. Not every black person participates in “black Cornell”, but those who do are part of a tight knit community that kinda has its own culture- black Cornell has its own parties, own culture around Greek life, its own memes, its own group chats, etc.

**Why the POC experience is important to understanding SA* 
- Understanding the POC is essential to understanding SA. Someone doesn’t run for SA unless 1) they want a resumé booster or 2) they genuinely believe they can change something about Cornell. It’s just logical that the students who feel most isolated from the greater Cornell community would also be more invested in SA and more likely to take an official position. Thus, a lot of students of color end up running for SA, and a lot of students of color feel a duty to vote for those SA members who are “prominent”/cosigned by their communities. 
- I also mentioned that black Cornellians specifically have their own culture, but also note that**black Cornell has its own prominent members who most black Cornellians know. The black SA members tend to be these “prominent” black Cornell figures. These are people with legit reputations among black students

**Given these factors, I have a lot of different thoughts on our SA**
- Why does SA come up with resolutions for problems that occur in our actual government?
    - Because the members within SA are mainly the members who don’t feel included at Cornell, and are taking measures to feel a bit less powerless and a bit more “wanted” by the Cornell community. It’s essentially trying to leverage the little power you have to create a place in the world you can fee safe in
- Why do certain SA members seem to be uncompromising and hostile to dissenting opinions? I think there are a few reasons:
    1. Students propose those measures because they genuinely think that they can make things better for POC, so when the race factor is ignored, they won’t compromise because they think dissent is dismissive of their feelings of discomfort 
    2. Reputation within your cultural community. **Edit: the way I expressed this was bad and dismissive, and I apologize for the cavalier tone on such a serious issue** 
    3. Many students conclude from developing “racial awareness” that they should embrace and not reject their identity. So some people feel justified in sharing their unfiltered opinions because that’s their “true self”
    4.  Some SA members talk for *each other* instead of talking for the whole committee. So when they say rude things to another member, they feel like saying those things *about* someone *to* their friends, and neglect the fact that they are also talking *to* another member instead of talking shit in the chat

**So, does this mean that SA’s actions does are justified?* 
Simply put- no. While I would personally argue that a majority of black students feel similarly to SA on black related issues, almost every black student I’ve talked to IRL on SA issues thinks that they go about it the wrong way and often aren’t focusing on the right goal to fix the problem. Essentially, they acknowledge SA identified a real problem, but disagree with their solution. However, it’s also important to note that the POC  who agree with SA tend to be the students who are most “othered” by a wealthy PWI and aren’t used to being in this kind of environment, so they try to “fix” it to something that feels familiar. 

That being said, their treatment of other assembly members is not okay by me. I think that they genuinely believe that dissenting opinions come from a place of not understanding black issues, and there is a nugget of truth to that. Thus, they believe their anger is righteous and that they were provoked. But what they fail to realize is that the factors that shape their Cornell
experience and comfort at the university are very different than the general Cornell student who has a whole different hosts of considerations.


**So, what’s the solution to the SA issue?**
 

In my opinion, a lot of the issues would be resolved if our campus had more cultural integration. 

Look, I love “black Cornell” with all of my heart. I like having a space with people I can relate to culturally and I am NOT trying to say that cultural collectives are a bad thing. But I think that POC students at Cornell are so separate that they don’t even see non-POC students as a part of “their Cornell”, so they try to shape the Cornell that’s best for them under the assumption Cornell caters to everyone else. 

Doing this naturally is... tough. The cultural barriers are extremely strong. But I think there’s some things Cornell can do to make all students feel like they belong that have don’t include vague political statements and pointless resolutions. 

In general, Cornell students are arguably more isolated than typical for US colleges. I think Cornell needs to work on really building a sense of community, even if that community is just one class year or just the people within a given college. 

I don’t have all the solutions for making the campus less culturally detached, but I do have a few ideas:
1. Less exclusive clubs! Make joining a club an afterthought instead of a multi week process
2. More generalized and less niche events meant to host a large section of the school, like slope day. Make it normal and natural to incorporate other cultures within these events. For example, if Cornell does like a field day (although field day is just our lives), incorporate foods, music, and exercises from other cultures *and don’t ruin it by acting like you’re so woke for doing this*
3. Make it so students 1) want to go to events and 2) can actually go to events. Bribe us with food or prizes or test points, whatever you can to get us to come. Maybe even allow every student a recreation day assignment allowance, where they can get an extension on an assignment if they’re busy participating in events. 
4. Encourage students to embrace their identities fully instead of code switching for other people’s comfort. 
5. Not sure how, but attempt to make all the various beautiful cultures on Campus represented in the day to day Cornellian life without a student having to actively seek out cultural exchange. 

Will a few fun events fix centuries of racism, xenophobia, and discrimination? Definitely not. But I think that if students feel like the greater university is also *for* them, their cultural enclaves would just be a support system instead of their only Cornell experience, and POC students wouldn’t feel like their only way to be represented in the mainstream university culture is through the dumbass org that is SA.

Electives for CS minor Senior year
Hey guys, rising senior minoring in CS. I was planning on taking 4320 and 4321 to wrap up my minor but it seems they don't give seniors priority in 4320 and 4321 isn't being offered. I'm planning on going into SWE. Does anyone else have other class recommendations? I plan on taking 4820 S/U (not for the minor) in the spring cause my course load is too heavy in the fall. Thanks!

Is the F21 roster still being updated?
There was a class on it when it was posted last night (soc 2560) that now says closed for enrollment and isn’t on student center anymore. Are there still changes being made to the classes being offered? Could this class come back or should I give up on it?

CS TA application questions.
I know they opened recently but can anyone explain the process to me. I was wondering about a few things.

1 - is there some type of interview or something that they call applicants into to take or do they mainly base decisions off of grade and other classes taken?

2 - are decisions rolling or do they just send out a mass decision on the deadline date? 

3 - under the circumstances where someone is given an acceptance to TA a course is it better to TA for money or credit? 

Thanks in advance.

how are people doing in this class? I feel that many times its a lot of work and I am not doing well. for those have taken this class last spring (NOT fall), how did people end up doing? Are things easier/grading nicer towards the end? I'm really stressed about this class....
--------------------------------------------------
Petition for class overlap?
The last fifteen minutes of a discussion for a class I want to take coincide with the first fifteen minutes of a lecture of another class I want to take (the other discussion options overlap even more with my prospective classes). Usually discussions dont require you to stay the whole time anyway so does anyone know if I can petition to take both of these? If so, who should I contact to do this?
--------------------------------------------------
Now that the roster is out I modeled my schedule for next semester. How doable is this? 18 credits. If anything got too bad I'd drop 4410 and take the next semester anyway.

--------------------------------------------------
Course Schedule Question
Hey everyone, so I’m looking through the Fall 2021 Course Enrollment section on Cornell’s website and I’m lowkey confused about one thing. It says that Cornell requires students to take two semesters of PE, which I was aware of, but it says that we have to take them in each semester of our first-year. It also says that, if you don’t know how to swim, you have to add the beginning swimming class in your schedule. Does anyone know how strict they are in maintaining that policy? I wasn’t planning on taking the swimming class freshman year since I wanted some time to adjust and just take a chill PE course. Are you allowed to take the class in later years? 

It also says that all students request courses during the enrollment period on July 12-16, but I thought we were supposed to do that during pre-enroll next month? Are incoming freshmen not allowed to participate in pre-enroll then? I’m literally so confused. Thank you in advance!

--------------------------------------------------
PE Courses/FWS Questions
Hey guys, since the roster is out now, I have two quick questions; I know that most PE courses require a fee, but I saw someone here say that, if you’re an HEOP/EOP student, it’s waived for you? Anyone know if that’s true? I didn’t hear anything about it or see it on the website or maybe they just changed it. I don’t know. Also, do PE courses count in the 18-credit limit for a semester? 

The other thing is that I’m still a little bit confused about the whole balloting for an FWS thing like can someone quickly explain how that works? I kinda get the general idea, but definitely need more elaboration. I know that we can’t add it to our cart. Also, when is it happening like would it be before classes start in August? Any help is appreciated! Thank you!

Gerst 3070 or other higer-level german classes
Forgot to mention, the class is: GERST 3070: Challenge of Literary Language

The description mentions practicing creating seminararbeiten and I am a tad scared that we'll have to write a full term paper? Anyone taken this class before and know how long the essays would typically be? I know it's a higher-level class, so I don't expect 1-page essays or anything, but a full term paper scary gaaaaah

Are there any other 3000+ level german classes that you guys would recommend? (They don't have to be offered this sem)
--------------------------------------------------
does the extended drop period apply to switching courses to S/U as well?
The drop deadline was extended until May 14th. Usually, the drop deadline coincides with the "change grade basis" deadline. 

Does anyone know if the deadline to switch to S/U has also been extended along with the deadline to drop?

Where can I take a passport picture in Ithaca?
I'm trying to take a passport picture, but am not sure where I should go for that.

If there's no other options, I will take it myself and print them in Walgreens or CVS, but if I can take pictures somewhere it would be nice.
--------------------------------------------------
Chances that more discussion sections get added / moved ?
There’s a class that I have to take to graduate (AEP Circuits), unless I can get into a different one with limited enrollment (Astro 4410), and it conflicts with a discussion section for another class (Phys 3317). Any chance the discussion section gets moved / more added? There’s two discussion sections on Friday for the class, I feel like it would be better to have one on Thursday and one on Friday....

(Something similar happened in PHYS 4443 this semester, and another discussion section was added, which was very useful for a lot of students and which is why I’m wondering how common it is for discussion sections to move around when numerous students have conflicts)

Language Classes
Hi everyone, quick question abt the language classes at Cornell, do the language classes have a penpal/exchange partner kind of program? For example, if you’re taking a German class, your professor could have you be paired up with a high school student/university student from Germany to learn each other’s languages? I’ve seen that as a thing for some universities, but I don’t know if that’s a common thing or completely depends on the professor and their teaching styles. I’m curious on how it’s like for Cornell. Thanks!

Transferring into Dyson
Hi all. I’m interested in possibly transferring to Dyson into my Junior year. What are some classes that would help my admissions chances and provide some more insight if I actually want to? I already took micro and macro, thought both were pretty boring. Took a class in almost every discipline I thought I would be interested, thought those were boring. I hate math so I feel if I want to fall back on business/ finance then Dyson is better since it’s less theoretical and more practical. I’m also interested in pre med, but it’s so hard to see if I want to go through with it with how horrible intro bio classes are. Any advice? Course recommendations? Thanks

What is wrong with the SA
I just saw a clip of an SA call of people just ganging up on this one SA member, saying stuff like "suck my ass, just suck my f**king ass right now bro", "it's on sight", "are you still on the call, are you not gonna hop off?". I hate the said SA member but that's no way for civil discourse, whatever the subject, whoever is speaking. Honestly it feels like that's just how SA operates now. Obviously this is only a part of a bigger problem, and perhaps there's some context for the video that I'm missing (if so please let me know), but I'm just disappointed that people can't express themselves coherently and respectfully. That's my rant.

Dyson School
I was hoping someone here could help explain the process of double majoring in CALS and the Dyson school or if they would recommend just transferring to Dyson all together. I am currently a high school senior who will be attending in the fall for a biology major but am also interested in finance. From the outside it seems like you’re pretty locked into your major from the start at Cornell and I’m just not that set in stone about dedicating my life to go bio and then med school.

Hey guys, I'm a freshman planning to major in CS in engineering and I just realized I took Cs 2110 instead of engrd 2110 first semester. Will I still receive credit for cs 2110 or is there some kind of petition I have to fill out to switch codes? Anyone make this mistake before?

Cornell VS. Upenn
This year i got super lucky and got into 2 super awesome schools, Cornell and Penn. I have no idea how to decide as I'm not completely sure what to look for in a college. I'm interested in majoring in anthropology/archaeology but I want to be able to explore my other interests as well (like taking art classes). Currently I'm kind of leaning towards cornell because I've heard that the Penn environment is really competitive though I'm not sure that really matters. I need to really figure out the pros and cons of the schools

Is Cornell an intellectually curious/motivated school?
Hi, I was admitted into the College of Engineering, and I'm currently trying to decide whether I should go to Cornell or save money at my state school. I have a few questions about the overall environment and the students within engineering specifically.

1. Are students generally motivated outside of class? I.e., are people constantly having discussions about whatever they're learning, and are they intellectually curious? 
2. Does it seem like students are always doing something exceptional, whether that's leadership, research, or schoolwork? I visited the campus recently and it seemed to give off that vibe, but it was also a cold, rainy day where people didn't seem to have much else to do.

I love pretty much everything else about Cornell, but I can only get a feel for these questions from students who are actually there. Also, I know that it's a big school, and there is a community for everyone, but I'm wondering what the overall culture is like.

Trigger Warning: Sophomore Regretting Major
I haven’t seen many posts about major regret so I decided to make my own.

For some context I was a very naive high school senior with big dreams. I decided to major in a vague humanities major (won’t specify due to privacy reasons) that I thought had productive applications to the business world. This was a huge mistake as I didn’t really know what I wanted to do and didn’t know what it took to be successful in life. After almost two years at Cornell I now know that employment prospects for this major are pretty bleak. There are only a few students who will launch successful careers from just the bachelors alone. This is not something that was expressed to me before I signed up by older students and faculty in the major department.

In retrospect, I should’ve chosen to major in something specific and secure like engineering or nursing. Money is important for maintaining a safe and healthy lifestyle which is a lesson I am now just learning. I took the more nebulous passion route and disregarded financial stability in my future career aspirations. This was the result of bad advice and a lack of mentorship as a young student. I did have a parent who tried to speak some sense into me but I didn’t listen to them. 

I am now wondering if I should just cut my losses and switch to another program, drop out or just stick with it. Pursuing grad school or professional school is also another option although I’ve never been much of a school person and I hate the idea of accruing more debt. I will say that careers I could pursue with this route do seem appealing and more tailored. 

I feel like such a failure after accruing so much debt and wasting my parents money for such a vague and somewhat useless major (useless in terms of employment prospects). I’ve also been been battling with thoughts of just ending it all. I wish I had taken the two years after high school to find a stable career path worth going to school for rather than just jumping into a stressful college environment without really knowing how hard it would be to find success in the field that I chose.
--------------------------------------------------
Considering Dropping Out
Over this last semester I’ve been thinking critically about dropping out, and I dont know if it’s burn out or depression but I just feel so broken. I had so many options and chose Cornell and from the start I feel like I’ve been set up for failure. Im a rising junior and my gpa is a 3.1 (might be lower by the end of this semester) I pay for school all on my own, rent, books, everything, and it’s a lot of money to do out of pocket. Im a bio major and I feel like Im too stupid to be here. My schedule got ruined because Shapleigh put me in 3 bio courses when only one was a requirement (his own class was not required, that I almost failed, he wouldn’t let me drop, or tell me my grade in so it ruined my gpa from the start) and then I never took chem so now I have to take it over the summer but I can only take 2070, not 2080, and might have to do that here, which I know I’ll do poorly in and Ill also have to do orgo and physics somehow (again, not the brightest bulb here) . If I have a bad gpa, no money, and a useless degree (even though I might not even graduate on time) and crippling depression I don’t know if it’s worth being here. I know Im half way done but I legitimately do not know if I can survive another two years here. Does anyone have any advice, thoughts, opinions?
--------------------------------------------------
Reviews of classes for the summer?
Does anyone have any advice on any of the following classes? I'm starting to plan for the summer.

Cornell vs. Notre Dame
Hey Everyone,

College deadlines are coming up on Saturday, and I have to make the decision between Cornell and Notre Dame for undergrad.  Honestly, at this point I feel like flipping a coin would be the best way to decide because I have no idea which one to pick. I'll bullet out what I'm thinking about both schools below, and any **unbiased** help (even though I know y'all are Cornellians!) would really be appreciated. And if I get something wrong, feel free to correct me!

&#x200B;

* I'm the type of extrovert that kind of finds my way anywhere I go...so at both schools I think I would be content, it's just finding the best of the two that's the tough part! I visited and liked both
* I don't really know what I want to study...somewhere in STEM and considering something in business if I end up liking it
* *When I get into specific majors and programs, a lot of people tell me "they're both great schools. That shouldn't be what you base your decision off of. You'll be fine in any school in regards to major." I don't know how to feel about that. What do you think?*
* Admitted Arts and Letters at ND, Arts and Sciences at Cornell (willing to internally transfer if needed).
* I have a sibling currently at ND, so a little bit of me wants to go do my own thing, but there's also a lot of pressure from family to go to ND (although I can overwrite it easily) 

**Cornell**

* It's an IVY. It's more well known. I hate to make a decision based off of prestige, but I also recognize it is something to consider. When I tell people the decision I have to make, everyone assumes Cornell because they think ND is a football school...it shouldn't influence me but it definitely does.
* Afraid of the competitive (sometime cutthroat) environment and **stress**...I'm obviously okay with hard classes but I don't want school to be the bane of my existence anymore. At Notre Dame, I don't think it's as bad.
   * I think the competitiveness is also represented in the **quality of student life,** which has a worse rating. Also, almost everyone I've talked to LOVES ND...I can't say the same at Cornell (because I don't know many people from here!)
* I would have a lot of fun in a frat and will 100% join one.
* Can't major across schools...I'm thinking of doing some business major in addition to whatever STEM major I pick, and at ND I'd be able to double up.
* Since I'm kind of undecided on major, I can't go wrong in what I end of picking. Cornell is great in basically every field I'm interested in! (This brings up, though, the bullet point three in the first list)
* Really good food, ND's kind of sucks

**Notre Dame**

* ND Culture...this is something Cornell does not have. Before you argue against that point, I have family at ND and the community there is unlike any school I have seen. The downside to that it is kind of homogenous (Catholic, not as diverse, generally outgoing student body), but I fit in most of those categories so it's not a bother to me.
   * To build off that, the student body is more like me. But, this has pros and cons. I love being around 40% of admits who were hs varsity sports captains, but the lack of diversity can definitely be a negative. For example, I would say most of ND's engineer students aren't your typical awkward engineer student...at Cornell, I know there's loads of that.
* Notre Dame is kind of unknown in the Northeast (where I'm from and where I want to end up). I have no idea if it that will be a problem career-wise in the future, so should I consider this? Someone told me that if I go to ND, I'll have to work a little harder to get the same opportunities at Cornell.
* Football and sports, obviously! And the dorm life kind of replaces frats in a way, so I don't mind it at all. Although I loosely prefer Cornell's Greek life.
* Mendoza is really the only highly regarded school (SC Johnson might beat it out)...Arts and Letters or Engineering aren't really prestigious, but, again, refer to bullet point three in the general list.
* Alumni network is super strong -- someone described it to me as cult-like.
* Don't care about religion, parietals, and being more conservative (still liberal tho)

If you could give me your two cents and any opinions, I would appreciate it! Please don't bother responding "you can't go wrong with either - it doesn't matter" because that doesn't help. Your honest opinions help me!

Also, I've been peeping around the sub for a while, so I want to thank everyone for their unknowing help!

Does it make sense to commit before receiving financial aid?
Title. I am a HEOP student so I think (hope) that my financial aid from Cornell will be enough for me to be able to commit without much worry, but I also have a friend that is not HEOP and the only thing keeping him from committing is financial aid. 

I’m aware that the financial office is slow, and there’s the extension and whatnot but the deadline for other colleges is May 1, and it’s not really possible for him to put a couple hundred dollars down for another school with the possibility of losing it. 

Has anyone committed before receiving their financial aid package and did it end up backfiring? Or are any incoming freshman thinking of or already have committed without seeing their financial aid package?

Are 2080 and 2090 Weed Out Classes?
I’m in Chem 2090 with pretty good grades, while I dont want to pursue a chemical engineering major I’d like to explore the subject more. 

My question is, are all/most chemistry/chemical engineering courses that follow 2090 like this? Or is 2090 intentionally designed to be a bit harder than the average course in chem as far as content per week and test difficulty?

Any commentary is appreciated.

Future Transfer Here, I Have Some Questions
Hi there! So I just got accepted to transfer as an undergraduate English major and I have some questions and also a pretty big problem, well two pretty big problems. 

&#x200B;

The first is that I've signed a contract and gotten approved to get funding from my university which is contingent upon my being in the same program in the Fall of 2021. I was hoping that maybe I could defer my admissions decision until the Spring but I've never heard of a transfer doing that voluntarily. This research means a great deal to me and I don't want to lose it. Have you or anyone you know been accepted to transfer and deferred for a semester due to academic reasons? Let me know. It seems possible but I'm not sure.

&#x200B;

My second problem is I didn't know I had to submit a CSS Profile like I truly just submitted the FAFSA and thought that I would be fine. I know the deadline has passed but how likely is it that the office will still accept my form and consider me for financial aid past the deadline? I'm not sure how strict it is but if I don't get financial aid I truly will not be able to afford it. I don't know how this slipped my mind but let me know if you or anyone else you know has submitted financial aid stuff late and still been considered for aid. I'm pretty worried.

&#x200B;

Also reach out if you're an English major! Women and LGBTs to the front, I want to make sure I'm making the right choice and I need as much help as possible. Tell me why I should come to Cornell. Thanks!

Procrastinators Unite!
Whatever you did or didn't do your first 3 wellness days is fine.  They're over.

Today is the day to make a difference.  If you have done nothing since the middle of last week, today is the day to start working.  It doesn't have to be a killer day but you will regret it if you don't treat today as a warm up for your last month of the semester.  Get 4 or 6 hours in around your last carefree hours.

Similarly, it you have been procrastinating taking any time off, today is the day to head to the Slope/Collegetown/Arboretum and get your mind off of work for a solid 4 hours or so.  You can't afford to not have any break at all.

You will feel better if today is a balanced day.  Take care everyone.  You got this.

COVID Rant
<RANT>

I'm from India (over 350k cases a day right now). Over 10 of my relatives (close relatives) are currently infected and a couple of them are in critical condition. My girlfriend's both parents and grandmother tested positive last week. 20 minutes ago I found out her grandmother's health is deteriorating and she needs a ventilator ASAP. Due to the sheer number of infected patients right now, there is a serious shortage of hospital beds and ICUs in India. The healthcare system has collapsed.

I'm scared for her. I'm scared of everything. It's so overwhelming right now. I fear that my parents and grandparents might get infected any day and there is nothing I can do about it. I tried to look up for covid resources online and found nothing. And that's the best I can do to help from here. It feels so overwhelming and too much. On top of that I can't spend my time worrying about it. I have 4 projects to work on simultaneously and yet I can't concentrate. How do I stop this? How do I help the ones I care about? It just feels like a mess. Sorry about the rant. I hope you have a great day.

Looking for an ornithology mug
Hi! My mom went to Cornell, in the ornithology department, and she loved the bird mugs she got there! Her favorite was the Waxwing, which showed a brown waxwing eating berries. A few days ago, it broke, and she was really sad about it. I tried to find a replacement online, but it looks like they don’t sell them anymore, and I couldn’t find anyone willing to give theirs up. If anyone here has one they don’t want, I’d be happy to purchase it from you, name your price! I know this is an odd request, but it would make my mom really happy. Thanks!

Just how bad is Collegetown party noises?
I'm a new arch graduate student and am currently looking at collegetown terrace for 2 bedrooms. I almost made the decision to live there but then I heard that the noise was terrible and i'm likely not getting any sleep? Is this an exaggeration? Previously I live in NYC but I have never had any apartment that would have noise THAT bad. 

Is this statement true only for the weekends? Also is this true for all housings in Collegetown (Crossing, center, plaza, etc. ) or specific to Collegetown Terrace? This is very important for me to know. Because sleep time is precious and it matters a lot to me. 

Also I am very confused by the directions these apartments are facing. Why all the west facing bedrooms? I thought Ithaca is cold and thus you would want southern exposure, etc...

BTW, any recommendations for graduate student housing is appreciated! I already know about Fall Creek, the north ones, cayuga heights, etc. But ideally I would still like to stay in Collegetown. I have heard decent things about CT Crossing and 312 and stuff?
--------------------------------------------------
Transferring to Fully Remote
Okay, so basically this last semester has been a HUGE struggle as everyone probably knows. However, this last week my mental health has taken a significant dip despite being bad previously. I was approved to go home for the wellness days for "mental health reasons" and had everything set in order but unfortunately one of my professors told me that if I went she would not accommodate me to take the prelim while in the 5-day quarantine after so I had to cancel my travel plans. Now I am considering going fully remote because I truthfully cannot take it here anymore. What do you guys think? Is it worth going fully remote so late in the semester?

To the people screaming Sammy Adam’s all night longer in Keeton... big frowns.

Making friends junior year
I was wondering if it's still possible to make new friends and meet new people junior year. I'm finishing my sophomore year and I realized I'm not close with anyone.

Faculty Senate Still Debating Anti-racism Proposals
The Cornell Review has a good update:  [Faculty Votes to Decide if Cornell Abandons Its Core Values | The Cornell Review](https://www.thecornellreview.org/faculty-votes-to-decide-if-cornell-abandons-its-core-values/) 

It appears that instead of a single 4 credit hour class, they will follow what the Arts and CALS have done in allowing students to pick from a menu of relevant classes offered within each college. This would avoid the transfer of $12 million of tuition revenue from the colleges back to the Provost.

I find it strange that the [DoBetterCornell](https://dobettercornell.com/static/pdfs/Faculty_Senate_Presentation.pdf) authors ask us to trust undergraduate students to join faculty hiring panels, evaluate professors on their DEI skills each semester, and hold half the seats on the Internal Governing Council of the new anti-racism center, while they are saying that only BIPOC students can be trusted for those roles.  Apparently, non-BIPOC students are too biased.

Wellness days feel meaningless
I’m sorry to add to the downcast posts on the sub, I mostly just needed a place to vent. The wellness days feel meaningless. I’ve been paralyzed for the last 48 hours by all the things I have to do. I have 3 overdue essays and 4 projects due in the next two weeks, but I haven’t done anything except stare at my phone for the last two days. And I know it’s my fault for letting it get to this point, but my brain just isn’t processing things anymore. I’m so miserable, and I feel like I’ve exhausted all the “resources” Cornell provides 

My dorm hallway is filled with laughter, and my social media feed is filled with people on wine tours or on slope - just a painful reminder of how lonely I still am after 2 years at this school

As a side note, it feels like this isn’t going to end with the semester. I’m lucky to have an opportunity lined up for summer, but I know it’s going to be more procrastination and work, and then the fall will start, and I’ll never get a break. I don’t know how to get out of this

Laundry/Printer Question
Hey y’all, I’m starting to get through my Cornell To-Do list and I’m also going to PSP this summer so I gotta get some stuff done and I’m a little confused about laundry. Can someone explain how laundry works at Cornell? From my understanding, you have to load some money into an account so does that mean that none of it is covered by financial aid at all? You have to pay money from your own pocket? How much money is usually enough for a whole week or a whole semester? 

Also, how long does laundry usually take (if there are available machines) including washing it then drying it? Ideally, I’d like to wait for mine so they don’t get stolen or anything; is that completely doable and allowed?

In addition, where are some places with free printing? I know some people bring their own printer, but most that I’ve seen are super expensive and I don’t actually know how often I’d actually use it. Thank you so much!! You guys are amazing.

Thoughts for people who feel like "House of Cards/ Always on thin Ice"
It sounds like you are too focused on your goals and/or not focused enough on your process/attitude.  Feeling like you are on "thin ice" and one misstep from disaster is another way of saying you are actually NOT behind in anything.  If you spend any time here on r/Cornell you know many people think they can't say that.  Further, you give an example of a misstep that didn't end your world.  My guess is that you can list several more so when you think about it carefully the ice isn't really as thin as you thought, is it?

If you look around on here, I've given lots of academic advice if you are looking for that.  But, I'm more interested in how you think you have many relationships that are a single wrong dm away from imploding?  My guess is that you are mixing up relationships with acquaintances.  The entire point of having lots of acquaintances is to have that dm where you go out on a limb and try to get them to plan something with you in the future so you can anticipate it together and build into a relationship.   College is basically designed to let you have lots of practice with this process.  If you don't have enough of those awkward dms/conversations you will never get to be any good at them.

The basic rules are:

1. Mix up the different kinds of relationships you are trying to start/improve.  For example, don't try for one romantic relationship after another.  You need strong platonic relationships to balance things to keep you from being too obsessed and have more to offer at the beginning of a romantic relationship.
2. Mix up your attempts at leading and following.  If someone is happy to allow you to tag along but will never do what you want to do, let the relationship fizzle, it isn't worth saving.  This also helps you try new things.
3. Mix up what you do.  It's fine to have relationships that are based around academics or Class XXXX but if you never eat or do anything nonacademic with those people, between semesters you are going to feel like you are on "thin ice".  and you are going to have to "start over" again and again.
4. Don't rush things.  People want to be needed but also want to need you.  Mutual anticipation of a future activities is often a stronger relationship basis than seeing someone every day.  Yes, it's harder to accomplish but given how busy we all are its more realistic and a more useful skill to have when you leave Cornell.
5. You really do have to be intentional about this.  Thinking chance is going to give you a dozen close friends is a recipe for failure.  At best, chance is going to take you to the outskirts of a group of people that hangs out basically as acquaintances.  Then you have to reach out to one or a few at a time and build relationships.
6. To be ready to create/plan these relationship building activities, keep track of things that are going to happen at Cornell in the future that you are interested in doing.  This is good academic advice too because looking forward to relaxing events is much better than looking forward to time where you think you might not have to do anything.  Relaxation is all about giving your mind a break from thinking about XXXXXX.  That doesn't happen if you are trying to do as little as possible.  Hanging out is like junk food for relationships.  Sharing an activity that is important enough to you and/or the other person/group so that you can't think about work you should be doing, is restorative and builds relationships.
7. This suggestion is for those who have mastered the earlier ideas.  At a certain point, you may want to invite people to become part of your habits.  If you are great at exercising every day, that is a good way to pull people in because they want to exercise but can't get themselves to do it.  But don't expect, even someone who you think is as dedicated as you, to be completely on board.  If you are a world class pianist that you are going to get people to practice with you every day.  Settle for one, fairly unserious, Jam session a week.
8. Finally, don't take any of these rules too seriously.  Yes, more relationships are likely better than fewer but its a personal decision, no one is keeping score.  Mostly, being intentional and planning will be beneficial but spontaneity and a little relationship "junk" hanging out will keep you from feeling rushed and over scheduled.

Anyway, good luck.

Location Adjustment for City Folk?
I’m an admit from San Francisco, and one of my concerns about choosing Cornell is the fact that it’s so remote compared to SF. I’m really used to going out and having lots of things to do, so i would appreciate any insight from anyone who also wanted an urban location for their college experience! Like did Ithaca surpass your expectations for social scene? Or do I just have to accept that it won’t be as vibrant as being in LA or DC?

thoughts on taking CS 3110 junior year?
cs courses plan:
sophomore fall - cs 2110
sophomore spring - cs 2800
junior fall - cs 3110

I know some people combine 2800 with either, but I don’t think I can do that unless I do 2800 pass fail lol. Would I be disadvantaged in any way or is 3110 okay junior fall?

Econ 3130. Fall 2020. Super lame....
was anyone else super disappointed with econ 3130 w McKee last fall?

the lectures were super surface level - he did basic examples which did not help understand any of the complicated concepts or problem solving techniques.

and my disc ta was totally ruse and hard to understand - going to office hours was a total waste of time. 

also, the exams were a joke - a bad joke to be precise. he wanted to do auto checking. so all he cared was the answer matching to some number of digits. so you could do everything right but do the wrong arithmetic - and you would fail the class.. the MC canvas quiz was super incompatible with a math and stats class.

classes lile this show how the professor does NOT care about students learning, and their mental health and well being.

overall not good :( i hope cornell has a review system to understand which professors care the students and learning.

sucks cause I heard good things about McKee and was excited and then turned out like this :(
