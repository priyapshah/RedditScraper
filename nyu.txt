So, placement exams for my program (Graduate Music Technology) were supposed to live today. The link to the exam website comes up with a 404. Are other music students experiencing this issue, and if so, does anyone know why/have a workaround?

Deferring Enrollment
Hi! I'm currently trying to defer my enrollment and take a gap year, but I can't find the form. This is what the NYU website says:  
"Complete the NYU Deferred Enrollment Request Form, accessible through the NYU Admitted Student Portal, by the deadline specified for the campus to which you were admitted."

However, I can't find the form in the Admitted Student Portal.

Does anyone know where exactly it is or have better instructions as to where I can find it?

Thanks.

Are there any steps after submitting the Housing Application for incoming freshmen?

Transfer from MS CE TO MS CS
Hi. Can I transfer from NYU Tandon MS CE to MS CS ?

How do you borrow a book from the Bobst library?

--------------------------------------------------
Can someone explain the curriculum/gen-ed requirements?
And a bunch of sub-questions:

Are there specific required courses that everyone takes?

How many semesters do you take each class for?

Is it easy to take courses in other schools?

In what ways is the curriculum not flexible?

Can major courses count towards gen-ed credits?
--------------------------------------------------
Delay in Internal Transfer Decision
Never thought of a significant delay like this before!

I applied to Stern and admission office may still haven’t started releasing the decision. 

The delay is really annoying. I cannot further my summer plan like internship and summer courses because I don’t know my academic direction yet. 

Feel anxious! Is there anyone in a similar situation?
--------------------------------------------------
Need advice about time management
Hi, I'm wondering what is the best way to manage my time as a student. I don't find one tool that has it all. What do you think?  
If you are willing to share what tools do you use and if you're satisfied or not it can really help me.  
Thanks :)

Hoping/planning on attending as a grad student Fall '22. Any tips? Pros/Cons?
I'm a small-town Texas guy who's going into his senior year of college this fall. I was looking around at grad school programs at different colleges and came across NYU. The first one that caught my eye was the MS in Sports Management, the second is an MBA in General Business (If I recall?) 

I'm a marketing major at my current school, 4.0 GPA (hoping to maintain it!). Gotta take my GRE and whatnot as well. 

Now for the fun part... I've never been out of the state of Texas. NEVER. Never been to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Louisiana, anywhere. I lived in a household with a dad who was very strict and would manage to keep me under his thumb no matter what. Well, that's over. I decided to not let him control me anymore. With that said, New York sounds like a great place. 

What are some tips you guys/gals could give me? Any pros/cons? I know it'd be rough for a small-town Texas guy to move to NYC, but it'd fulfill a dream of mine. 

Thank you in advance!

Unable to access housing application?
For some reason whenever I try to do the housing application it says that I do not have access to it. It gave me a list of info to copy and paste and email to them, and for some weird reason one of the lines said “Status: waitlist undergraduate” even though I definitely did not get waitlisted and I even committed yesterday. I waited and even 24 hours after committing I’m still unable to access the app. They haven’t responded to my email and the deadline is at 5 tomorrow so I’m kinda worried and have no idea what to do.

Edit: just realized that the only term available is spring 2021 and not fall, the situation keeps getting weirder
--------------------------------------------------
Confused
I heard somewhere that the housing application for Fall 2021 is due tomorrow. But the housing application for us returning students is not even live.

What’s really going on here? I’ve been trying to figure this out throughout the past month. I’m a current freshman.
--------------------------------------------------

Internal Transfer to Tisch Film&TV
Anyone else apply as an internal transfer for Tisch Film & TV not hear back yet? 

On the Tisch site it says they’d notify applicants by April and as such I’ve been checking my email all month long. Seeing as though April is now finally coming to a close, I’m wondering if I should check in with my academic advisor / people at Tisch to see what the deal is. Fingers crossed the delay doesn’t mean bad news.
--------------------------------------------------
Breaking into Investment Banking
As a student entering Stern, quite clueless to be truthful, I’d like to hear some opinions on how difficult it is/ what’s needed to break into investment banking at a top bank (Bulge bracket or elite boutique).

Around how many Stern students make it yearly?
What GPA is needed to get an interview, or, personally, what GPA should be aimed for? 
How do the chances change from a 3.5 to 3.9 GPA?

And anything else you have to add.
Really looking forward to some friendly input!
--------------------------------------------------
Housing
I’m trying to do the housing application and everytime I tru to do the academic year application I only see the option for spring 2021 not for fall 2021, does anyone know what I should do because it’s due tomorrow at 5 pm on Saturday and their unavailable until Monday.
--------------------------------------------------
Getting into classes?
Hi! I'm a newly admitted student and was wondering how hard it is to get into classes. Because I didn't receive any FA, it's really important for me to graduate on time (possibly early??). Thanks for your input :)

Last question. Can I have some pros and cons about Rubin and Brittany Hall?
 Can some people give me some notes about it because I’m debating on these two as my top dorm choice. Trying to save some money as I have to pay for school 3 more times, haha. I think Brittany has more amenities and looks newer, and I’m aware of Rubin’s AC problem but I’m from the Deep South so that will be no issue.

Anyone help me out and sway my opinion? :o

Anyone interested in taking an accelerated EMT class in June?
i paid and signed up for a 2 week accelerated EMT class in June (around the first 2 weeks,) but I've had something come up and it may conflict with me taking the class. the class is over zoom, with the exception of the final few days with in person practical lessons. the class has been full for a while now, but if anyone would be interested in taking my spot (for the same cost i paid) please let me know. its a much faster way to get EMT certified compared to most courses

&#x200B;

its based in nyc, but u only have to be in nyc for the practica class days (only 4). U can also take an exam at the end that allows u to use ur certification in most states

GSOC Update for Today
Since there is a LOT of misinformation floating around, thought it would be helpful to share the GSOC update for today! Happy to answer any questions :) 

&#x200B;

 

Dear Fellow Member,

A huge number of you turned out for our first session with a mediator. While NYU continued to stonewall, presenting nothing, we set out a full contract outline, compromising on and dropping many proposals at the same time as retaining strong, transformative demands. We were willing to end the strike last night if NYU accepted. They did not, and had no counter-proposals. [**We bargain again today, Friday, April 30th, at 3pm**](https://makingabetternyu.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fe9afebe718f52829cc8343fd&id=2ff58c65a5&e=8b5ee6af81). The strike continues! 

Let’s keep the pressure on!

**What did mediation look like?**

We entered mediation with Todd Austin from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) yesterday. The session opened with us from GSOC in the same room as the NYU bargaining committee along with the mediator, Todd. Shortly after we were split up into different rooms, with the mediator moving back and forth. This resulted in long pauses in the progress of the session, which lasted over ten hours. The platform for mediation is [**RingCentral**](https://makingabetternyu.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fe9afebe718f52829cc8343fd&id=198c9d50f2&e=8b5ee6af81), which is basically the same as Zoom. Over 150 grad workers were present to observe, demonstrating to both NYU and the mediator the collective strength behind our demands.  
 

**What did NYU present?**

Nothing! 

**What did we present?**

We had three testimonials from graduate workers. One detailed the inadequate housing accommodations for workers with disabilities to impress upon NYU the importance of our equity and inclusion demands. We also had testimonials about the tax issues faced by international workers to give evidence against NYU’s claim that existing services are adequate to the needs of international and immigrant workers.  


We sent NYU a new and narrower set of proposals that thoroughly detailed modifications to our current contract. We moved down and dropped proposals, while retaining strong, transformative demands that we know are most important to you. We were willing to end the strike last night if NYU accepted our refined set of proposals.  
 

**Highlights:**

* We maintained demands such as our $32 hourly wage, 40% tuition waivers, full coverage of all dental services and procedures through Stu-Dent, and $9,000 childcare subsidies for children under 6.
* We modified our demand for out-of-pocket healthcare coverage by accepting NYU’s proposed fund structure, but proposed increasing the fund from NYU’s proposed $200K to $500K in the first year of the contract rising to $1M by the end of a proposed 4 year contract. $1M would cover the median out-of-pocket costs per member as reported in our recent survey. We accepted NYU’s offer for a group legal plan, but asked for a subsidized rate. NYU had offered it to us at the same cost as other employees. And we lowered our demands for the funds for tax and legal assistance for international and immigrant workers.
* We dropped proposals such as housing stipends and free metrocards, an equity and inclusion fund, and compensation for the bargaining committee.

**How did NYU respond?**  


They said nothing, and presented no counter proposals. We learned that NYU wants GSOC to drop things that they deem to be non-mandatory subjects of bargaining. NYU did not share with the mediator what specific proposals they thought were non-mandatory, nor did they give any indication of what they were willing to bargain on. This is another instance of NYU’s stalling. We agreed to mediation at their request, but NYU remains intransigent. **After making us wait until nearly 11pm, NYU said they needed more time to respond to our proposals.**  
 

**What happens next?**

We will meet NYU with the mediator again today, Friday, April 30, at 3pm. Download the [**RingCentral App**](https://makingabetternyu.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fe9afebe718f52829cc8343fd&id=7bc0cffae3&e=8b5ee6af81) in advance to observe, and click to [**RSVP**](https://makingabetternyu.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fe9afebe718f52829cc8343fd&id=6f2b407b77&e=8b5ee6af81)**.** Our strike continues. 

**Join us on the picket line today for a day of action.** Bernie Sanders will call in to the picket line in support of our strike and we’ll hear from DSA candidates for public office, followed by a Cops off Campus Speak Out.  


In Solidarity,  
Your colleagues at GSOC

BS/MS Program Financial Aid
I’m currently enrolled in a BS/MS program at Tandon and I’m hoping someone in the program can answer my question. Or if you’re in a similar accelerated program at another school maybe I can get your input too. 

During your 5th year, if you’re still taking undergrad courses in addition to grad courses does the scholarship you got for undergrad still apply, or were you given some other form of aid?  I called the financial aid office but it seems like they weren’t entirely sure. 

Alternatively, if I’m just taking grad courses during my 5th year what scholarship opportunities are available? I currently have a scholarship that covers most of my tuition and I’m wondering if I’ll be given a similar scholarship if I just take grad courses in my 5th year?
--------------------------------------------------
do grad students get paid while on strike?
Mostly curiosity. Are grad students docked pay for being on strike this week? Does the union pay them while on strike?

I spoke with a grad student who said she still assumes she is getting paid. Is this true?

Anyone in the union care to clarify? How much is UAW paying?
--------------------------------------------------

Does anyone know where they are supposed to pay for their enrollment deposit? I just accepted my awards and I’m about to go apply for housing but I have no Idea where to send the 500 enrollment deposit. Can anyone help?

what is the price difference for low-cost housing?
i've been trying to do research before submitting my housing app - weighing the pros and cons of low cost housing compared to regular housing. but i cant seem to find anywhere the exact cost difference between the two?

i see the average cost of dorms in each building, but not specifically low cost ones. does anyone know how much id be saving?

i'm kind of panicking bc its 2 days away from may 1st 😃 pls help

wellness exchange
so I know the wellness exchange is not super well-liked anyways but I am specifically wondering how understanding they are about issues that relate to money problems and disabilities. I am having a really rough day related to my financial situation and disability and was considering reaching out for a call to just talk things over but I know it will make things worse if I am talking to someone who is just oblivious about what it's like to struggle with money, or disability issues. Have any low-income (or otherwise financially struggling) or disabled students had experiences with the wellness exchange?
--------------------------------------------------
Another Housing Question lol
What are the options as far as dorm rates are concerned (from those who have dormed before). I’ve heard phrases such as having a triple to save money and I haven’t seen an option like that in the official Housing Rates for the 2020-2021 year.

Can someone enlighten me on like the secret rates I guess lmao
--------------------------------------------------
Housing Application Question for everyone
Ok so I just submitted my Housing Application. When they send your results back do they only let you in one dorm and you have to say yes to that one or do they tell you which ones you’ve gotten in and you get to choose from a selection of dorms you got in?

Comparing GSAS and Tandon MS in math
I was recently admitted to the MS in math programs for both GSAS and Tandon, and they are my final 2 choices, but I have no idea which one is a better fit. I only know that they are different in terms of graduation requirements and location. Can someone tell me what the difference is between them in any other aspects, such as work load, reputation, and quality of education? 

I know that these are both great programs and I am 
comfortable going to either one of them. But I still want to make a better choice by getting to know them a bit more. Any help would be greatly appreciated and thanks in advance.

Greed Begets More Greed: NYU Strike
To all those on strike, you have lost sight of what truly NYU needs to focus on - the students. 

If "NYU can afford it", then why not ask them to lower tuition costs? Specifically, in an equitable way that allows even more underprivileged individuals to attend. 

At the same time, extending highly-improved tuition remission benefits to graduate student workers would effectively put more money in the pockets of the student workers.

How many times have we seen on this forum people who worked their entire academic life towards NYU only to have the door slammed shut due to not being able to afford it. Breaks my heart every time. 

To the graduate student worker on strike: I know you deserve more. Go out there and get it. Your knowledge and skills are immensely valuable. There are employers willing to offer fair terms, and even help with tuition costs in many cases. While we are lucky to have you, earning a living wage is much more important. 

Wishing you all the best.

Old Roommate Left Damages in Dorm
Heyyyy!

I was just wondering what the process for this situation is. 

Currently, I'm in an NYU dorm. 

 My old roommate had put some LED Lights on her side of the wall, and when she was moving out, she removed the lights. However, this ripped off some paint. 

She moved out last semester if that is relevant. 

She tried painting over it with white paint, but it still is pretty visible. I don't want to be charged for this, but she isn't in the room anymore. Is there any way I can let NYU know not to charge me?
--------------------------------------------------
What's rent like for students living off campus?
Hey all!

I'm planning on moving out of dorms my second year and was just curious about what is considered cheap rent for students living off campus in apartments. I also plan on having flat mates so what's the situation like for most people (how many people you split the rent with and how much is the rent/person)? What neighborhoods have more affordable housing and what is the average commute time to campus?

Outside scholarships?
So I won a 500 dollar outside merit scholarships renewable 4 years totaling 2000 from a academic organization, and was wondering if NYU accept outside merit scholarships. Like will the merit outside scholarships show up in my financial aid package and most importantly will NYU somehow decrease my financial aid package cause I just earned a 2000 merit scholarships rather then the right thing to do is just adding on to the original package to lessen my burden on tuition. I hope NYU accept outside merit scholarships.

Remote freshman applying for housing?
Hey all - I'm currently a freshman who spent the whole year studying remotely.

just a small appreciation ramble at 3 am
Maybe it's because the semester is almost over or maybe it's because I am an absolute simp for all of my friends, but I'm reminiscing and overall, I'm really happy with how this year went. I know a lot of people struggled to make friends and even I, a self-proclaimed extrovert, found myself struggling to find a group of reliable real friends outside of my major for a while. I feel like I owe a lot to this Reddit because I have a small friend group from one of the people in my friend group posting about making a small group about wanting to have friends and we ended up having a 13 person group chat. Two of them are even about to become my roommates. We all managed to hang out with each other safely and consistently, even with Covid-19 wrecking our freshman year. I'm really appreciative of them and honestly, Reddit because I don't think I would have met them if it weren't for Reddit. So yeah... even though this school will kick my a$$ in tuition costs, at least I've found some people that make the hole in my pocket hurt just ever so slightly less. (if you guys see this... :/ i actually hate you all and you all are stinky incels) 

&#x200B;

(For anyone concerned with Covid safety guidelines, yes we do wear masks, a lot of us even double masking. Not all 13 of us hang out all at once, typically a lot of people can't come, so it rotates. We're all in dorms so we're required to test each week. And we've never gone into each other's rooms because we all live in different dorms. Also, almost all of us are now vaccinated.)

Also I'm from CS background and my interests are SDE and ML, there are good amount of CS related courses in ECE so I believe this is a better fit for me. What do you guys think? Please few suggestions and correct me if I'm wrong
--------------------------------------------------
The Theory of Probability
I am planning to take this class next Fall but I'm not sure if I'm advanced enough. Is doing well in calc 3 and linear algebra good enough? Or do I need to have some proof writing experience and take Analysis.
--------------------------------------------------
Psych Lab Class Recommendations
I'm looking to take a lab to fulfill the Core C requirement for my psych major. Can someone recommend any lab classes? What was your experience like/course load? Thanks a lot (:
--------------------------------------------------
Is NYU only offering singles for summer housing this year? Will doubles be converted to singles?
Wondering if anyone knew. Thanks so much!

Predictions about the strike
Interested in what people think is gonna happen given the current strike. Would the TAs reach an agreement with the school and come back to grade their piles of assignments and exams? Or do you guys think the professors are gonna step in and do the TAs work?
--------------------------------------------------
Anyone staying on campus for the summer?
If anyone wants to hang out during the summer session :)

registration and academic advising
Do most freshman speak with an academic advisor for their major before registering? Is there a process to make an appointment? Is there anywhere on the NYU website with this type of information? Thanks!

Off campus Housing.
Hey, I’m an incoming MSCS student at NYU Courant in Fall ‘21. About me: 24yrs, indian female. I’ve been trying to look for off campus housing around the university, within a budget of $1k/month per person to be shared. As an international student, I’m looking for guidance on the areas that I can find a good neighbourhood and an ease of access to the university. If someone can advice me on the following aspects, it’ll be really helpful. 

1. What are the good locations to look for affordable off campus housing with a good neighbourhood?

2. When should I start searching for the apartment? I’ll be coming to NY in August. 

3. How should I look for roommates to share the apartment with? Looking for 1-2 females to share the space with. I’m open to discuss with someone who’s in search to sublet. 

It’ll be really helpful of you to please guide me on these.

Thanks!

I just declined my offer to NYU (even though I really didn't want too)
I never thought in my wildest dreams I would be admitted here. I never thought I would be considered a good enough student to come here. But on March 31st, 2021 I found out that NYU believed in me enough to enter me into their freshman class. I was ecstatic (I even got the entire thing on video). I was on cloud nine, I'm going to New York City! I haven't been back since my first visit in 2016! I'm gonna have an apartment, I'm gonna be able to see central park and go back to the theatre district (COVID isn't a thing in my imagination) and I will be happy. Then the next day I woke up to an email stating that I had received no financial aid from NYU. Looking at the bill I was in disbelief. My family can't afford 80K a year, I already have a sister in college and she's planning on law school. I was heart broken. I tried to appeal to the financial aid office, but it was to no avail. Then I sat down with a financial aid consultant at NYU and I told her my situation. She gave me great advice. Just wait for grad school. It's what she did, she went to her state school for her undergraduate degree and then came back over to NYU for her master's. She said it was the best decision she made and she's also not in a lot of debt because of it. It made me feel better that I was making the right call.

NYU even though I couldn't come to your amazing institution, thank you for giving me the confidence that I needed in order to keep going on to do great things. You will for sure see my grad school application in a few years.

Also if you're on the waiting list, I wish you the best of luck, because one of you just got my old spot.

Housing Application Error
I am an incoming freshman. Last year, I withdrew my enrollment and reapplied this year. (I applied to housing as well)
Now when I try to apply for housing, it says I am unavailable. I wrote email to housing office 3 days ago and there is no answer. What should I do?
--------------------------------------------------
final exam times
Hi!

This is my first semester here so I don't really know how everything works. For final exams, I see that we have 1hr50mins scheduled which is longer than our usual lectures. Are the exams usually that much longer or is it just a school wide thing where everything is scheduled that way no matter what? Thanks for any info!

NYU Recent Grad Looking For Help From The NYU Community
Hello folks,

&#x200B;

Before I event start asking for help, I want to congratulate you guys for having created such a tight knit community on Reddit. I feel somewhat silly for not having used this platform to connect with you all while I was still a student. It's kind of sad thinking about the amount of people I could've met and the connections that I never made.

 **Better late than never right?!?!?**

Well, I'm here today to ask for your help. I graduated in May 2020 and as you know, the pandemic has basically ruined everything. As part of my capstone project, I worked on a startup venture with a team of NYU grad students. The company is designed to help NYU students to rent their own apartments without having to pay NYU $15-$25k to share a small room in a residence hall with another student.

We started LEASY (Lease Easy), an institutional guarantor. It means that we simply guarantee/consign the lease for anyone who do not meet all of the qualifications required to rent your own place in the city. If you do not make 40X the rent or have a great credit score history, it is extremely difficult to rent a good apartment. As a result, many students, especially international students, end up paying NYU a ridiculous amount to live on campus for about 6-8 months; or they end up renting a room in someone's apartment where they are basically paying for the whole apartment (My old roommate used to charge people 90% of the rent to stay in their 2nd bedroom and only pay the remaining 10%).

So, we are writing to ask the NYU Community to spare 5 minutes of your day and let us know how we can make LEASY work best for you. 

[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19YkTYWXW6lsSkCR4W-\_D51psuflhpPEAd-bztlw8yVY/viewform?edit\_requested=true](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19YkTYWXW6lsSkCR4W-_D51psuflhpPEAd-bztlw8yVY/viewform?edit_requested=true)
--------------------------------------------------
Master's at Gallatin?
I'm looking to see if Gallatin is a suitable school for me to apply to in the future. I am a 26 (M) with a BFA in dance from a liberal arts school in NYC. My main interests lie in creative direction with artists, cultural/sociological observations regarding race and sexuality, and fashion marketing. I hope to enter a creative field that allows me to have a voice that contributes to creative endeavors such as fashion branding, casting talent, working closely with other artists of all disciplines, and critically considering the current social climate in prospective works.

Is this even a major? Wondering if something like this exists at NYU or at and NYC graduate programs.

Thank you and much love

Paying graduate workers more is cheaper than alternative
With the grad worker strike and classes being cut and assignments removed, it is a nice reminder of the more expensive alternative.

Instead of graduate student workers teaching, researching, and grading, NYU is completely capable of hiring new adjunct and tenure-track faculty along with postdocs to do this work.

However, this is far more expensive, as many of them will demand higher wages and better benefits than graduate student workers are asking for right now. If you are worried about tuition increases from the graduate workers, imagine how high it would be if they chose the faculty route.

Not to mention that faculty typically hold advanced degrees, and this a small group of workers. It may be difficult to find workers qualified and willing to complete the "grunt" work they already did in..., well..., graduate school.

Remember, NYU chose to set up a system to rely on graduate student workers. It is not unreasonable that they, as workers (yes even as part time workers), should be able to leverage their position in the system to demand better wages and benefits.

Appealing FA?
Hi! Does anyone have advice for appealing financial aid (ie what to say/write)? 

Also, does anyone have suggestions for asking for an extension to the accept/decline deadline? 

Tysm, advice much appreciated!

GSOC ON STRIKE! - the other side of the story
I’ve seen a lot of people here repeating the narrative the administration distributed yesterday in an email. The email was biased and ridicules the grad student movement, so I felt the need to share this. 

As of today, NYU's Graduate Student Union (GSOC) is on STRIKE for fair wages and better working conditions. Unfortunately, Andrew Hamilton and the rest of the administration would like to have you believe that this strike will fundamentally hurt undergraduate students. However, the university has failed to mention that they have bargained in bad faith with the union for the past 10 months and rejected their reasonable proposals every chance they had. You can read more about why GSOC is striking and what types of demands NYU has rejected here: http://bit.ly/gsoc-strike-faq.

While GSOC is on strike, it is so important that undergraduate students show their support for the union. Andrew Hamilton has already tried to pit us against our TAs so it is important now more than ever that we show up for GSOC. Show your support by showing up to the picket line either in person or virtually by signing up here: https://bit.ly/GSOC-InPersonPicket-SignUp or http://bit.ly/GSOC-VirtualPicket-SignUp. With recitations cancelled this week, going to the picket when your recitations normally meet is a great way to fit an hour or two of support into your schedule without having to change your plans!

And if you can’t carve out time to actually show up to the picket line, you can still help out by donating to GSOC’s mutual aid fund https://opencollective.com/gsoc-uaw-local-2110.

Once again, it is crucial that undergraduate students support our TAs during this strike. Their working conditions are our learning conditions, and we know that we all deserve more from NYU. A complete list of resources to support GSOC can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ygrKrZflWcR71nglKG9wwpr4-xcJ0ZHJ2LgIyHWTiVY/edit

Summer volunteer research positions
I really wanted a position at Mount Sinai but they’re only taking students who already had previous assignments and I had no luck (or replies) with emailing a bunch of individual profs. Does anyone know any places taking in students? Would it be weird to email profs from other universities?

Grad students: what is your funding situation actually like?
Hey, I went to NYU for undergrad and applied for a PhD a few years back. I was told, back then, that there was no guaranteed funding at NYU for PhD students (ie no stipends, no “free” insurance), but guaranteed full scholarships.

I ended up doing my PhD elsewhere for a variety of reasons. I make a $32k annual stipend, have pretty good insurance (better than any plan that I could afford while working as an engineer between undergrad and grad school), and pay zero tuition. My stipend can come from sources of funding that my advisor arranges, from my university (if I’m a 1st year and my advisor has no funds available for some reason), or from teaching (if I’m a 2nd year student or above). If I teach, I do not receive any extra pay.  If I take a summer research internship that pays, I do not receive stipend pay for the duration of the internship. Of course, if you get an outside fellowship (GRFP, NDSEG, NSTGRO, etc), your pay is dictated that fellowship.

My girlfriend who is doing her PhD at another school has almost the same pay as me, with the same funding policy and same benefits as me. Another school that accepted me for a PhD also gave me the same pay/benefits offer, give it take $1k/year.

How does that compare to NYU? I’m very confused because I read some people saying there’s a base stipend of $40k? Some people say TA’s make money on top of a stipend? Some don’t mention stipends at all? What about insurance and tuition?

Computer Science + Data Science Major — skipping DS For Everyone
I’m currently a CS major hoping to do the joint CS + DS major. I’ve completed quite a bit of my CS courses already (Data Structures, Discrete Math, CSO, and Basic Alg) and have done solidly well so far in all (I ended w/ an A in Data Structures, A- in Discrete, and currently have As in CSO and Basic Alg). I hope to take a Data Science course in the fall but am unsure whether to take DS for Everyone or skip straight into Intro to DS as I can since I’ve taken CS classes. Though I have lots of CS experience, I’ve never used Python and also have no stats experience which I’ve heard is useful. Should I place into Intro or take DS For Everyone?

[Megathread] Prospective Students, Applications, and Admissions
Dear prospective students,

We appreciate your interest in NYU! Feel free to ask questions about the school and the application process in this weekly post!

Do take advice about your chances of admission with a grain of salt:

* An application is a holistic process and we can’t see everything you submit
* We  don’t actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what  they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence which often isn't the  best
* Please direct information-sensitive questions to the [NYU Admissions Office](https://www.nyu.edu/footer/contact-us.html)
* NYU's admission rate drops every year and standards go up, so even the  anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's  applications

Good luck!

MCC vs. IDM
I know these two are actually different a lot...but still. 

So MCC is more theory-based or it will have more practice after choosing a concentration?

For now, my only concern toward IDM is the separate school. How far is Tandon from other schools?

what happens if a professor strikes
forgive me if this is a dumb question, but i got an email from a department head saying that my professor may be striking. she is an adjunct grad. the email gave optional work to do, but was pretty vague about the course of the rest of the semester. where does this leave the students? will we still get credit for the course even if we don’t get to finish it because our prof is gone? this is for a french class btw

CMV: The TA strike doesn't really make any sense
I usually lurk on this sub, but I am want to know more about this subject. It's usually **fuck** NYU, but this time around, I am a little confused as to why everybody is jumping on Andy. Let me get things clear:

- A TA position is considered a *part-time job* meaning that they are only allowed to work 20 hours a week.

- The TAs going on strike want a liveable wage because it is expensive to live in NYC (minimum wage is $15/hr in NYC, but they want $32/hr)

- They also want other benefits such as getting 40% of their tuition back, stipends for children, etc.

- GSOC is refusing to use a 3rd party mediator.

- They're going on strike during the last 2 weeks of class, which kinda fucks over us undergrads who benefit from having TAs

Doesn't this all seem like a bit much? I'm all for them getting paid more, but isn't $32/hr a lot? Maybe I'm confused, but I've worked my fair share of part time jobs and I never viewed a part time job as something that I could use in itself to sustain a comfortable lifestyle. So why are they using the term "liveable wage" when it's a part time job? Are they expecting to afford a studio in NYC working 20 hours a week when people generally work double that and still often need roommates?

As for the benefits, do these benefits have precedent in other schools? Would a TA at, for example, Ole Miss get 40% tuition remission for their work? Do colleges (or employers in general) usually provide their employees who are immigrants with legal protection and tax assistance (what even is this?)? Do colleges usually give a stipend for each TA's kids? If they do, then I guess I'm wrong, but I assume that this isn't the case. I understand that progress has to be made, but all of these benefits put together seems like a shit ton of money. If NYU did acquiesce to each of their demands, this would have to mean that NYU treats their TAs magnitudes better than any major college in the US right? How would NYU pay for all of this?

Also, I think this does punish the undergrads. We already get fucked over by having to pay a lot to go to this school (although nobody is forcing us to go here) and have paid full tuition to stare at a computer screen for damn near 3 semesters. Now, in the last two weeks of class, the TAs are just dipping? I have a major paper due at the end of the week and if I want to ask my TA for help, I can't because the TAs for my class are on strike. I just hope that they decide to be lenient on our grades because we often gain a lot from their assistance. If this goes on any longer, this might even affect our finals, which in that case, I think it's only fair that they are extremely lenient on our grades.

I get that TAs do a lot and often my TAs have been the ones to save my ass when my professor sucks, but I don't feel compelled to side with GSOC. I'm all for a pay increase and them getting extra benefits, but I don't agree with their list of demands. I'm not trying to come off as an NYU shill, but I'm just confused. CMV.

None of my professors have even mentioned the strike? How do I know if my recitations and labs are impacted?
Yeah basically the title. I’m taking gen chem with lab, principles of bio with lab, intro to psych and another class which doesn’t have grad students involved. Anyone else in these classes know how the strike is impacting them?

Cost of nyu?
I got accepted to NYU 2025 but i really cant get over the cost. If i go here its gonna be a whopping 50k and idk how i feel about that....
Anyways is this cost normal or am i on the higher end? how much did you have to pay (if you're comfortable telling me). 
also how likely is it for me to get more aid if i email them about it?
--------------------------------------------------
Why does NYU have its two portal campuses?
I don't know if it's a hot take or if I offend anyone (I'm sorry in advance), but what point is there for NYU Abu Dhabi and NYU Shanghai to exist as full campuses? The only possible reason I can think of is the revenue from international kids who don't or can't go to the U.S. Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't these campuses bleed money from NYU and lower the prestige a bit? I might sound elitist, but these schools feel like luxury add ons that don't really need to exist.

Edit: Realized that my initial post seems a bit douchy and is filled with preconceived notions of how the world works without proper research. Will leave this up but I apologize for making a dumb assumption regarding these schools. I originally made this because I was wondering how NYU could pay the grad students better without cutting into the NYC school’s budget. To all of those about to write angry comments, I made a mistake and I know it. Thank you for educating me.
--------------------------------------------------
Queries regarding masters in computer engineering
Got into MS in Computer Engineering at NYU. Here's where I have few doubts, I am interested in software development, ML related research. Is CE program a good fit for me? Theoretically I could do ML related courses + few CS courses according to curriculum, so do people actually do that? Is this possible? Moreover actually I like the opportunity to do intership for 3 credits but again the condition is to do some internship related to electrical engineering so does that mean if I do an ML role or software dev role it doesn't count? Also CE students can do reasearch thesis but again related to electrical engineering so can I do some ML research instead?? 

Answer to any of these questions is highly appreciated.
--------------------------------------------------
Are elective summer classes worth the cost?
I got a scholarship of $800/credit for summer tuition. I want to take this four-credit elective at Tisch, which would add up to a total of $3500 after applying the scholarship. Should I just wait and take it in the fall semester? This class tends to fill up quickly, too and I see that it's still open for the second summer session so I'm eager to take that opportunity.

&#x200B;

My rationale for taking it in the summer is that I want to take the time to really enjoy this course without worrying about other classes. Then again, it does cost a lot.

&#x200B;

What do you guys think? Would it make more sense to take a more important class like a major requirement instead?

Can we get Andy Hamilton to stop comparing NYU to Ivy League schools?
It’s embarrassing. NYU is an already prestigious school with its own unique advantages, so he can hype it up without unprofessionally dissing other schools. I don’t know why he resorts to that.
--------------------------------------------------
I stand with the Grad Students
I am a UG student, but I see firsthand how hard the grad students work. They have their own expenses, their own lives, some have children. Maybe it is time for Andrew Hamilton to consider cutting his 2 million dollar salary instead of saying there is not enough money for everything. I am not saying his salary being cut will alone solve the school's funding issues, not at all. However, it seems foolish to draw  more money than many will ever save in their life per year in the midst of a pandemic.  #strike
--------------------------------------------------
sending a university wide email smearing graduate students for demanding fair pay? Okay then.
Andy Hamilton, ever heard of the Streisand effect?

loneliness and lack of motivation
I’m a first year student who arrived in NY this semester (couldn’t come last semester cos of visa issues). I’ve been trying to make friends, but it feels like ppl already established their friend groups first semester. I try and say hi to students as i pass by, but i long gave this up since it proved ineffective. I’m an extrovert too, so this semester kinda been a lonely, depressing experience. It’s gotten so bad that i’m on dating apps to make friends and not hookup 💀, because hooking up w strangers leaves me feeling lonelier after. I’m also not from the US, so it’s weird seeing all the shootings that have been going on, people seem kind of desensitised to it. I miss my friends back home; our banter was perfect. it sucks that i’m a 14 hour flight away from my home. I was always on the fence between studying in the UK vs the US, but i ended up studying here because my friends all applied to US universities. i’m starting to regret my decision a bit, but i rly wanna love this university and city

Does anyone else feel like they’re lonely? hit me up, i’m so bored all the time. it’d be fun to go on an adventure w some mates. some of my passions r music, fashion, sports, and having a beer or any drink with some good friends.

Learning Accommodations for students with disabilities?
Hi All! I was accepted to NYU as a transfer applied psychology major. I have some learning disabilities, the one that’s gives me the most problems is my Dyslexia. So, how willing/good is NYU with providing the necessary accommodations required by law? Ex of Accommodation: having the teachers PowerPoint.

I have some friends who go to other big university and have heard that their schools basically refused too help even with all the correct paperwork.

Withdrawing from a Course
This semester was pretty horrible for me and I got behind in this class and never managed to catch up. To an extent, I gave up to be honest and was just hoping to pass with a  D. But, I just realized I completely missed a HW Assignment and that was the only thing propping up my grade.

What consequence is withdrawing from this course going to have on things like financial aid, academic standing, maybe grad school if anyone has experience with a W on their transcript? To clarify I have 16 credits so I would drop to 12 which I believe is still full-time. But does an F and then a retake look better on your transcript? I scheduled an advising appointment but it's the weekend and I want to know if I should bother studying for this midterm on Monday.

I still have a midterm and a final left in this class and I would save myself a lot of mental energy just withdrawing at this point than kidding myself I could get 100's on both of them and still get a C.

Thanks in advance for any input.

Edit: thanks for the responses everybody. By “holding up my grade” I just meant it was the difference between an F and a [potential] D. I’d still have to be top of the class on both exams to even get a C or D, and my professor wanted to see improvement (aka not not turning in a hw assignment for no reason). 

Definitely withdrawing and I’ll update on if I can flex the credits to this summer for anybody interested. 

Thanks :)

Do folks appeal to increase their scholarship amount?
International student and got admit for MS Computer Engineering at Tandon. They have offered a scholarship of 6000 usd. Doing an honest calculation of all the costs involved in the program, this barely cuts it and making it difficult for me to consider joining.

I was hoping to appeal to reconsider my scholarship amount but before going down that road I wanted to soundboard this idea in this sub.

Would be grateful for your feedback if you were in a similar situation.

Also who would be the right person to make an appeal to, grad admission team or the departmental program head?

Please consider donating to NYU's robotics esports team
Hi everyone,

If you're not interested or don't have the means to support us, no problem. But please don't downvote this post. I'm part of NYU's RoboMaster team where we represent our university in the annual DJI RoboMaster tournament. It's a [massive esports competition](https://www.robomaster.com/en-US) where we control actual robots (built by hand!) instead of pixels on a screen.

We're super passionate about the project, but this is our first year running and NYU has not given us sufficient funding (even though the project qualifies as a course for credit). We've already built two robots but really need to purchase raw materials for the third and final robot. You can track our build progress on our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nyurobomaster/).

Our [Rising Violets Fundraising Page](https://risingviolets.nyu.edu/project/25012) is active with 26 days to go. We have different contribution tiers including stickers, pins, t-shirts, and even a 3D printed model robot. If you're feeling generous and have the means to contribute any amount, we would be extremely grateful.

Have a wonderful day!

Financial Aid Appeal
Hey everyone! I'm a recent class of '25 admit. I know that it's a long shot, given NYU's reputation regarding financial aid, but I was hoping to send them a letter of appeal. I'm just not sure where to send it. Because I haven't been matriculated, I can't access the form through albert. 

so, is it appropriate to send it to the email listed on the financial aid webpage?

Can I be an applied psychology major but on a pre med track?
Hi Everyone, first time posting on this sub so I'm sorry if formatting or anything is wrong. I  was wondering if I could apply as an applied psych major at Steinhardt but take pre med courses as well. I quickly searched up like a biology course however and nothing popped up in Steinhardt. Would it be possible to take classes from other NYU schools while still being an Applied Psych major at Steihardt? Sorry if this comes off as wordy! Please let me know if I can clarify.

NYU Rory Meyers Lead Honors Program
Hi. I got into NYU Rory Meyers and I was wondering if I should join the LEAD honors program. I want to know if it's worth it because NYU's website really doesn't say much about it. Any advice would be nice.
--------------------------------------------------
Should I apply to the presidential honors program?
The deadline's tonight and I'm still on the fence about whether or not it'll be worth it. Also, I'll have to do the honors track if I get accepted and I'm a psych major, so I was wondering how difficult that is.

Former/Current Econ Majors: What has kept you in the major/what major did you switch to?
Title. Current sophomore Econ Major on the policy track here. Took Urban last semester and taking International this semester. So far, I've dragged my feet through both, and I still have to take the Intermediates and 300s.

I'm not looking for a direct answer to my situation of whether I should continue the major or not, but I would like to hear any stories of what has kept people in econ or what major they switched to.

Do courses get better in the mid-levels and 300s? Or should I expect the current content I'm learning as a litmus test of my interest?

I'm considering trying out Math since it'd continue from MFE 2, and I feel it's the only aspect of econ that I really enjoy and makes sense.

Also looking at trying out Data Science since there are some available courses this summer, and I'm on track to complete a non-coding minor. I'm still thinking of staying on the technical side of things.

If you had switched from an econ major, what did you switch to?

Thanks in advance.

NYU ethernet/router issues?
I live in the dorms and have an Xbox hooked up to the nyu-media network via ethernet cable. Lately I've been having a lot of problems with my internet connection, especially with multiplayer gaming and downloads/updates. It says my Xbox is connected to the internet, but I keep having problems getting any multiplayer features to even start up, and when I can even start them up, I quickly get kicked out because of connection issues. Any games or updates are also downloading insanely slowly, like frequently 1 - 5 mbps, and sometimes they'll even stop downloading completely for several minutes at a time. 

I'm very much not a tech expert, but my Xbox network settings do say that my NAT type is moderate and that my UPnP is not successful, and based on my googling, it seems like that could be the issue. However, every bit of advice I see on how to resolve this issue tells me to restart my router, and obviously, AFAIK that's not something I can do since it's not like I have access to a personal router. I'm going to be emailing NYU IT today but figured I'd post here and see if anyone else has had issues like this, and if anyone has figured out ways to address issues like this that are supposed to be resolved by messing with personal routers?

(Edit: forgot another issue I've been having and added that in)

How much do you have to pay in taxes for on-campus jobs?
I'm considering an offer to do Graduate Studies in NYU, but it is so expensive that I have to work 20 hours since the first semester to be able to afford it. But I also want to know how much of that will be cut in taxes, so I can budget myself correctly.

Tips from any past Welcome Week Leaders?
I've applied to be a welcome leader for this coming Fall 2021 NYU Welcome, and I just got the email for the group interview process. Are there any past welcome leaders here that can offer some insight on how their experience was? Any advice for the interview? 

Also, I'm wondering if this position is paid because if it is, since I'm an international student I'd have to go to the SSN office to get a social security number etc etc. Thanks so much!

Are self-defense items allowed at NYU?
I’m attending NYU next semester in the Fall and I want to be safe. NYC is a big city and I want to explore, so I gotta state safe. Especially as a female. A lot of people say you don’t need self defense items your self defense is your common sense but nah. I would feel much more comfortable with a self defense item like a taser.

Edit: Thank you all so much for the feedback!! I really appreciate it

Reneging offer from a big IB
Hey guys.

I am in a bit of a situation. I have accepted an offer from an IB for software engineering and I unexpectedly got an offer from another company recently.

I will be taking the other offer. I am wondering if NYU would care if I reneged on the IB. I did not apply through Wasserman. I applied online.

COVID vaccine for international students
Hey, I had a question on whether internationals would be required to receive both doses of the pfizer vaccine for us to attend in person classes, so I called the center for student health. While the lady didn't give me a definitive answer, she told me that we would most likely be fine since nyu knows that we would only have time to get the first shot after arriving in the US, and therefore give some leeway in regards to this matter. Do any current students/faculty have any insight regarding this matter? I'm asking because one would typically need to wait 3 weeks after receiving the first dose in order to get the second dose, and I don't think I can really arrive like a month and a half before classes just to get both doses.

Fastest possible transfer, cross-school minors, literally anything will be of help
Hi guys! I was just accepted for co2025 in the Interactive Media Arts program in Tisch. Unfortunately, I am having second thoughts about this major because it doesn't seem to give a great foundation in either design or computer science (seems a little too general and not specialized enough for me).

Basically, I was wondering if I could transfer to CAS for CS and do a minor in design. Is there any other faster way to transfer other than starting sophomore year? Like maybe after first semester freshman year? 

Theoretically, let's say I successfully transfer to CAS CS. I would really like the freedom to take more classes in Tisch/Steinhardt for art and design, is there any way to expand the 16 credit limit for taking classes across schools? The design minor is 16 credits and I'd like to take some other classes outside both my minor and CAS.

AND another thing that really bothers me is how Tisch costs $6000 more than the other schools and I know CAS gives out some fat scholarships sometimes, do you think I could be considered for those as a transfer?

I know yall are probably sick of confused freshmen... but any help would be much appreciated!! I am clueless !! thank you so much:)

1. Product Quality
2. Scarcity
3. Social Media Engagement
4. Economic Consciousness
5. Brand Loyalty
6. Intent to Purchase

Is the 'pre-med' track really as bad as CC says?
Hi! I'm an incoming CAS freshman majoring in neural sciences. I've been looking into how well NYU prepares students for medical school, and I saw that there were several posts on a college confidential  of people saying that science majors in general should not be applying to NYU as their grading system would hurt their GPA. Can this be corroborated or is this just a bunch of fear mongering??

Tour/lunch with a premed student this Saturday -

BA/MPH Dual Degree Grad Year

I'm considering a BA/MPH dual degree (4+1 program) through gallatin. If I do this, would I technically still graduate (get my undergraduate diploma, go to graduation, etc.) in my original grad year (2023) or would I not be graduating at all until 2024? Thanks!

Masters In Real Estate or Entrepreneurship
I will get an undergrad from a SUNY in psychology cause it was a cheaper option I realized id rather go into business but knew that SUNYS were not target schools and could not afford schools like NYU or Fordham etc due to their costs. I would go for a masters in either real estate or Entrepreneurship, if you guys have any other suggestions that would be great. Knowing that I came from a SUNY it would not land me any high end positions so I plan on starting my own company but also want to work in areas like finance, wall street and coming from a target school would help so would it be worth it to go to NYU for a masters in that or should I look into a different type of major or master degree? What should I do?
--------------------------------------------------

some help needed
hi! sorry i'm not entirely sure where to post this but i hope this is ok! i recently got accepted into nyu for 2025 & macaulay honors @ ccny. i'm a prospective premed student (although i'm still a bit iffy on this). the thing is nyu is asking for $56k per year for me whereas macaulay is 100% free... and i'm really terrified of wracking up student debt.

at the same time though, my parents are willing to help me out somewhat and are actually pushing me to commit to nyu. they were like what if you don't end up at med school? for a lot of jobs, having nyu on your resume will serve as a leg up. i've also heard about a friend's sister who went to nyu & ended up at suny downstate medical school with ppl who came from public universities and were essentially debt free. she said she kinda regretted the debt since there were ppl who still made it to the same school as her without taking on that burden.

i would really appreciate some honest perspectives on this because may 1st is coming soon & i feel so lost/torn

edit: \^\^ preferably from premeds but honestly any perspective is awesome! thank you :)

Work study?
Hi, I'm a rising freshman at Tandon. I was offered the federal work study which would help subsidize the cost a significant amount for me. I was wondering if NYU is good with giving the hours to students as I need the full $3k in order for my tuition to no longer be an issue for my family.

Scholarship
Has anybody had an incident where NYU would give you a scholarship for the incoming freshman not give it for the rest of the three years? I am an upcoming freshman and I am worried that they are not going to give me the scholarship for the rest of my three years. They also told me that there are no gpa requirement which is kind of weird. Can somebody reassure me that this won't happen.

Housing Rates Fall 2021? Any ideas?
Hey guys,

I was wondering how expensive housing is going to be for this upcoming fall. Any ideas? Because I've been mostly looking at the [2020-2021](https://www.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu/resLifeHousServ/documents/ApplicationsandAssignments/2020-2021HousingRates.pdf) Housing Rates to compare prices and figure out my list of best choices for this upcoming semester. But I recently realized that in past years, the dorm prices have all wildly differed from this and are much more expensive. Will next Fall be more similar to the [2019-2020](https://www.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu/resLifeHousServ/documents/ApplicationsandAssignments/Propposed2019-2020Rates.pdf) Housing Rates?

Rough calculations regarding the effect of vaccines on reopening in-person classes
[Source](https://www.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu/institutionalResearch/documents/NYU_Common_Data_Set_2020-21.3.22.pdf)

According to Section B subsection 1, 52,775 students were enrolled. This is an upper bound, as not all students are on campus. This also assumes that we don't count the incoming class of 2025, which AFAIK has no regular contact with the campus.

According to Section I subsection 7, there are at least 3349 faculty (with lots of asterisks). That's okay, there is some uncertainty to be expected.

That gives us an estimate of 56124 persons, and we'll just call that an upper bound.

Now, let's apply percentages of the 3 big vaccines specific to New York City.

Here are datasets published by the CDC.

||[Pfizer-BioNTech](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccine-Distribution-Allocations-by-Juris/saz5-9hgg/data)|[Moderna](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccine-Distribution-Allocations-by-Juris/b7pe-5nws/data)|[Janssen (J&J)](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccine-Distribution-Allocations-by-Juris/w9zu-fywh/data) |Cumulative|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|First Dose|128,700|95,200|15,100|239,000|
|Second Dose|128,700 |95,200|N/A|223,900|
|Total|257,400|190,400|15,100|462,900|
|Persons Immunized|128,700|95,200|15,100|239,000|
|% of immunizations|53.84|39.83|6.33|100|

Now, use these as weights of efficacy in the city. We can now estimate the percent of the population that will get COVID, considering everyone is vaccinated (which is a good enough assumption).

100-100\*(0.5384([0.950](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6950e2.htm?s_cid=mm6950e2_w))+0.3983([0.941](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm695152e1.htm?s_cid=mm695152e1_w))+0.0633(0.663))= 7.17518

7.18%, assuming ALL the students don't follow mask wearing or social distancing, and assuming that you can spread COVID just as easily while immunized as you could without it. And even then, that's an upper bound.

So,  7.17518% \* 56124 = 4024.

4024 infections in the absolute worst case. How low can it be cut down if we all follow precautions?

Unfortunately, that's a little hard to calculate. The following computation is probably wrong scientifically (because current infections affects later infections, because funny exponentials and calculus), but it gives a rough idea of what we're dealing with. The p-values in the cited study have something to be desired, but let's just say that masks cut down your risk by 90%, and masks lower by 65%.

Weighted together: 100(0.1\*0.35)=3.5

That gives us 4024\*3.5%=141 cases. More like a lower bound of an upper bound. If there was data on what % of students were on campus, the total number could be even lower assuming that we follow guidelines.

**Finally, to up things in perspective**: The current % positivity this week was [0.40 %](https://nyc.violettracker.com/nyu-status/#nav). Assuming our calculations, with the virus acting at its worst and us acting at our best, there would be a **37% reduction** in the infection rate.

^(Now I just need a statistics major to tell me how this is entirely incorrect.)

Does any NYU alum or current student have any thoughts on whether they think joining the Phi Beta Kappa Honor Society is worth the $85 registration fee or not? I'm hearing mixed thoughts about it from people outside of NYU (employers in general don't care at all, but also it's a relatively rare opportunity that not everyone gets). Just wanted to hear directly from someone who went to NYU.

For those who are living off campus, how much is your rent?
I’m new to this and I’m not sure what I should or shouldn’t be paying. I’ve been dorming at nyu for the past few years but I’m deciding to go off campus next year. I’m looking at single studios. How much do NYU students typically pay for rent when living off campus?

advisor refuses to respond to my email about advisor hold for summer classes
title. I have emailed this man 3 times in the course of a week and watched the waitlist for the class (first session discrete math) go from 0 people to 8. I’m kind of fuming inside because I really want to take this class but he will NOT respond. What do I do? Can I talk to someone else.. or is that bad form?

Leaving NYU
I’m currently a sophomore and in the process of transferring out, but I’m really gonna miss NYU. The main reason I’m leaving is financial, as if I stay at NYU, I’ll have a total of 80k of debt at the end of four years. Other than that, I have no other reason to transfer which is why it’s making this decision so tough. The professors are amazing, the resources are great, and of course the city. I just feel like I’m downgrading, and it sucks.
--------------------------------------------------
Gallatin Independent Study
So I just had an idea for an independent study project with a professor I currently learn from. The deadline is May 3rd. Is this enough time to approach the professor with the idea and work on it? In other words, would it be rude to email him with so little time to prepare? Apologies if this is obvious but I’m on the spectrum and don’t always know when things aren’t ~cool~ to do. Thanks guys!

My take on req vaccines- opinion
I'm totally okay with NYU requiring students to take the vaccines ( provided it's approved by the FDA). HOWEVER, it doesn't sit right with me knowing that for faculty it is not required. How are the parents going to feel safe if the professors their kids interact with are not vaccinated? What message does it send that the leaders of academia aren't required to do the same? Yes, Ik legally they can't require it for faculty... but how is it legal to require students that pay to be there to be vaccinated? It should either be for all or for none. This was just a rant. Thx for ur time! 

P.S I am not an anti-vaxxer whatsoever, so please don't assume thru my message that I am.

Pls the construction has literally been going on for 2 weeks and it’s non stop from 8am to 5pm ish AND ONLY ON WEEKDAYS. When I take midterms I literally have to leave the building to preserve my sanity. I cant. Idk what to do anymore. I’ve been blasting music, keeping a fan on high for background noise, using a speaker to listen to my classes, like??? I cant even crack open a window when my room gets really hot bcuz it gets so loud, I feel like I can literally hear someone using a jack hammer right next to me. I’m tired of this bullshit, does anyone know where we can complain about this?

Transfer from CAS to Political Economy at Stern
Hello, I am an incoming freshman admitted to the College of Arts and Science at NYU. I would love to transfer into the Business and Political Economy program at Stern but If I understand correctly, it is a specific program and not just another buissness concentration. I was planning on double majoring in Political Science and Econ at CAS but how practical is it to transfer to this program? I am very aware of Stern’s reputation and that transferring into it is very difficult but is it even a reasonable goal? If anyone can answer that or give me any advice that would be much appreciated!

Failing intro to computer science and want to kms
There is no way I’m going to pass the class this semester because I handed in 2 assignments that didn’t end up compiling and missed the deadline for another and assignments are worth 20% and now I have like a 50 in that section and got a 74 on the midterm so no matter how well I do on the final or project I’m still fucked so now I want to walk into oncoming traffic and hope for the best because my life is basically over I hate this school for how they treated us in a pandemic

No financial aid at all 💀
So I’m a senior in high school and an aspiring photographer and film maker.  I recently got accepted to NYU’s Tisch school of the arts but when I got my financial aid package back I was surprised to see I got no financial aid at all (just to put it out there, I’m not rich).  Am I the only one with this problem? Not too sure if I should complain to someone at the school about how I’m not getting anything when I’m a native New Yorker who’s family makes below 80k, or just give up on NYU.  Maybe I’m just freaking out on what I’m gonna do in terms of going to college.  Any words will help at this point honestly.  Thanks for listening to me complain.

Likelihood of ACTUALLY back in person
Hi! I know that LAST fall NYU said they were going back in person, and then had students pay for living spaces and they went online. What is the likelihood of actually being in person?

[Megathread] Prospective Students, Applications, and Admissions
Dear prospective students,

We appreciate your interest in NYU! Feel free to ask questions about the school and the application process in this weekly post!

Do take advice about your chances of admission with a grain of salt:

* An application is a holistic process and we can’t see everything you submit
* We  don’t actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what  they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence which often isn't the  best
* Please direct information-sensitive questions to the [NYU Admissions Office](https://www.nyu.edu/footer/contact-us.html)
* NYU's admission rate drops every year and standards go up, so even the  anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's  applications

Good luck!

Hey all, I know this is a long shot but I took this course in Fall 2015 and am now applying to grad schools. A few schools need to see the syllabus of this course to ensure it satisfies a prerequisite, but I did not keep the syllabus and "NYU Classes" no longer shows up for me on albert since I am no longer enrolled. If anyone has ever taken this course at any point (preferably with him) and could share the syllabus with me, I would be forever grateful!! 🙏

Any other current freshmen who have been remote all year worried about housing for the fall?
Since NYU is apparently going all in-person for the fall, I'm trying to prepare for what I'm going to do about housing. I know in the past NYU had this policy that if you dont use on campus housing during your first year, your guarantee to housing for the rest of your years at NYU is gone, but since the pandemic forced a lot of first years to go remote this semester, I would hope that the school will still offer this guarantee to freshmen. I called housing a few days ago asking about this and they said something along the lines of "you can assume that this policy won't be enforced since this is an irregular situation" but since NYU hasn't given any official announcements and housing apps are opening sometime this month (?), I'm still a little worried. Does anyone else have any thoughts on this? I would really appreciate it!

Accepted to LS program but wants to major in CS help pls
So I got accepted into the Liberal Studies program and I'm aware that means I'll have to do 2 years of that program's reqs and then be able to transfer to whatever school I choose (except for tisch and stern i know). I've read a bit about it and I'm sure I'll be fine with the actual curriculum if I do it, my only concern is that I want to major in Computer Science and I'm scared that I won't be able to complete the requirements I need if I do it. I heard that it's basically just getting gen eds out of the way in your first two years, but I'm not sure if that's 100% accurate. Does it take away too many opportunities to do your requirements or is it totally doable? Do any of you know anyone who has done it with any STEM major? Please help because I need to know if I should accept or decline this offer soon!!!! D:

Dual Degree Program
I am a CAS (international) sophomore interested in the dual degree program offered by departments from Tandon and CAS. I recently contacted one of advisors involved in this program, but found out it is a firm policy of the school that students passing the first semester of the sophomore year cannot join. Sure, no is no, and I have the second option to do a masters in a latter major, but is there any way I can get a petition or sort of way to figure things out?

[AMA] I am a graduating MS in Computer Science student at NYU. Ask me anything.
Hi all,

I am graduating from NYU Courant's Master of Science in Computer Science program in Fall 2021. I have received a lot of questions and connection requests from the incoming 2023 class, many of which were repetitive so I thought I'd answer them here.

I plan to answer questions here over the next 1-3 months. I will edit the description to state when I am done answering questions. My responses will probably be slow since I am in the last month of my graduate studies and am frantically trying to tie up all loose ends. I will probably reply during the weekend to questions sorted by upvotes, so please upvote questions you are interested in and avoid duplicate questions.

About Me:

1. I am an international student from India.
2. Gender: Male
3. My undergraduate studies were in Computer Science at a tier-2 Indian university.
4. I spent my time at NYU focusing on Artificial Intelligence.
5. I live in Jersey City, NJ. I would commute to NYU during my first semester but had no in-person contact with it once covid hit.  


Edit: Obviously, I am one student and do not know everything about Courant. It is impossible for me to provide accurate information on everything at such a huge school, so do your due diligence and speak to other students as well.

nyu housing: lipton or brittany hall?
i plan on living on campus this fall as an incoming freshman but am conflicted on what dorm i should put as my first choice. i've heard amazing things about lipton and brittany and those are my top 2 as of right now but i need help with which one i should put at the top of my list. i've heard that brittany might be haunted which honestly kind of terrifies me, but i've also heard that being housed in lipton is like winning the lottery and people who put that as their first choice and dont get it, usually get stuck with a dorm several steps down their ranking. which dorm is nicer and does brittany come with a fridge and a microwave? (i've heard that lipton doesn't)

What is life at NYU like as a grad student commuting from within the city?
I’m about 45 minutes on the train from campus on a good day. I’m attending a grad program in the Fall and like a lot of you, I am looking to make new friends. Any tips? I’m not even sure how the curriculum will look at that time. I’m hoping for more in person lectures but I know graduate study is more independent with less time in a classroom.
--------------------------------------------------
How did you afford NYU grad school? Is the debt worth it?
I have a massive dilemma in terms of whether or not to go to grad school and which one to pick. I applied to all London unis because they’re way cheaper than US ones, but for some reason, I also applied to NYU. My grades weren’t amazing in college so I only got into okay but not reputable London schools. I got into NYU which I didn’t expect to happen but I’d have to take out like $80,000 in loans. I'm going for Marketing - can't tell if the ROI is worth that amount of debt (About 40% of my loans will be interest-free, though).

Do I go to the universally recognized school, have an amazing network and clout forever and face a lot of debt, go to a not reputable school abroad in London, or just not go and move to New York and live a fun life of financial freedom? 

UK unis I got into: Royal Holloway University of London, Queen Mary U of London, U of Leeds, Brunel, Kingston (average total tuition for these is $30K)
--------------------------------------------------
Is Tandon/NYU in general worth it?
So I got rejected by every college I applied to except for CS at Tandon, and while I really want to go to NYC my parents want me to go to a community college and transfer to a UC (in state) to save money.

Is it worth it to go to NYU? I haven’t exactly heard the best things about Tandon, so I’d probably try to transfer to CAS for CS + Econ. I know that there’s probably better opportunities for internships/jobs at NYU, but I’m not really sure if it justifies the $70k price tag. 

Do I attend NYU in the hopes of internally transferring to CAS or does it make more sense to just transfer to another school from a community college?
--------------------------------------------------
Trying to find easy furnished housing
Hey everyone, I was just admitted to Stern for the Tech MBA which starts May 17. As such, I need to find a spot to live ASAP. I'd ideally like a place that's furnished, has multiple bedrooms so that I can have housemates and meet people, and is located close to campus. Does anyone have any recommendations? I looked at the grad student housing, but at 28 yo, I don't really feel like sharing a bedroom. Thanks!

meal plans experience (NYU Eats)?
gonna be a senior next year, and i haven't had meal plans since freshman year, before they converted to the NYU eats thing. can anyone who's had meal plans since then tell me if it's an upgrade from the system/provider before? thinking of getting the 95 flex for next fall just to swipe into downstein and spend the whole day there.
--------------------------------------------------
Are internal transfers for the same major permitted?
I've seen a couple of posts and people I know who say that they want to transfer from Tandon to CAS or vice versa while still studying CS or studying the same major. I know for the math major, you are no longer allowed to transfer between the schools to major in math again since the Assistant Director of Academic Affairs explicitly pointed it out.  However, I'm not sure if it just applies to the math major or all majors in general.  I'm not planning on doing an internal transfer but just curious.

BINX Saliva Kit False Positives??
I've been put into isolation at Second Street after getting a "positive" result from a Binx Kit. However, I am doubtful that I could've gotten Covid after 1. My CityMD rapid test immediately after getting the call was NEGATIVE, 2. I sent in this week 2 weeks after my Pfizer vaccine and the rate for Covid cases according to the CDC is < 1%, 3. I have been EXTREMELY cautious and have come into contact with only close family that never goes out/a couple of people that are also fully vaxed. The chances just seem SO low. I understand that the rate of false positives are also extremely low but I'm not sure if there's an issue with these Binx kits as they are not FDA approved. There are no studies online detailing this which is also making me doubtful.

&#x200B;

NYU has also been extremely not helpful in terms of not giving me a number to contact Covid Compliance as whenever I ask my I/Q coordinator a question, he just sends me copy and pasted Q&A's from their training guide... I feel extremely unsafe having been relocated as people in this dorm actually have Covid and uncomfortable given the fact that it feels like a jail cell.

&#x200B;

I've been hearing the saliva tests are not accurate and that this has happened to a few people where Binx says they are positive after being extremely cautious regarding Covid and they tested negative at CityMD immediately after. I was wondering if anyone here has had this issue or heard of anything regarding the accuracy of these saliva kits??

&#x200B;

This situation is just EXTREMELY frustrating being locked up for absolutely no reason. NYU will not even allow me out for a medical reason to go get another PCR test even for my own peace of mind. I'm thinking about relocating to an off campus empty place I have. If you have heard of any similar please let me know because this is honestly ridiculous.

Transferring from Tandon to CAS?

Class of 2025 Emails Question
Hey, 
For the class of 2025 admits here, for those who have set up their NYU emails, I was wondering when the last time you got an email from NYU on your NYU email was? Specifically stern kids would be ideal, but any NYU student please do answer. Just want to make sure I’m not missing any emails that I should be getting, I’m paranoid lol.

Politics in New School or Latin American Studies in NYU? I have to decide in like two days :(
So I was accepted at these two post graduate programs, both gave me some tuition discount (75% NSSR, 33% NYU), and I'm from Costa Rica, so I do have to take a loan and work. NYU is more expensive but I assume there's more on campus jobs, and I've heard that area studies could probably have a wider space for teaching or getting a job than a specific discipline like political science, which I've heard are less popular now.

Faculty is great in both, and finally, NYU is more prestigious, but NSSR has a very interesting background, and feels like a smaller place with less money but will look after me.

I have like a couple of days to decide :(

Can I check out of housing after May 11th even if I don't have finals?
I don't have finals, but I'll need to stay in NYC for another week since my last day for my on-campus job is the 19th, which is also the check out date I put in the housing portal survey.  As long as I leave before 12pm on May 19th, I'm assuming I should be fine? How will housing know/ check?
--------------------------------------------------
Liberal Studies (London) for Pre-Health - Worth it?
I was admitted into Liberal Studies with the first year starting site in London, but I would like to transfer to NYC (anyone know the chances?)

I've heard the LS Core isn't the best program for pre-health/premed students bc we can't complete the premed requisites our first year. I am currently on a pre-physician assistant track, looking to complete undergrad in 4 years and a PA program in 2 years. Some PA programs also require set clinical hours, which I'm worried I won't be able to do if I go to London my first year.

1. Is that a good enough reason for them to accept my transfer from London to NYC?
2. Is NYU worth going to for pre-health? Are there more opportunities there?

I'm also considering going to UW Madison CAS, but there are major differences between both schools. Madison is a college town and I don't really care about partying and athletics. 

NYU is only slightly more expensive but there is a higher standard of living, but if I go to London, that will be an additional cost. Ideally, I would like to go to NYU in NYC but is it worth it with all the hoops to jump through to get into CAS and to transfer sites? Does it set me up better for pre-heath than other schools?

What should I do? All thoughts welcome :)
--------------------------------------------------
Internal Transfer to CAS

Is it on my end or is the website's problem? Is anybody able to login and fill out the forms? I tried so many times and it doesn't work. Please help!

Most Compatible Minors with Biology?
Hi everyone,

I was hoping for advice on what minors are most compatible with the Biology major. By compatible, I mean the best bang for the buck in terms of course load. I know the obvious answer is the Chemistry minor since the Bio major seems to satisfy -all- requirements (BTW, does that mean all Bio majors automatically receive a Chem minor? I noticed the following on the Chem minor's description: "Only two of the four courses may also be used to satisfy the requirements of another department's major.")

Thanks!

housing...
I’ve been attending NYU remotely this year, and this is my first year, so I’m a bit lost on what I should do for next year. I know it’s cheaper to get an apartment off-campus, and I’m a sucker for cheap stuff, but at the same time, I don’t know anybody to room with and I might be better off being closer to campus because I haven’t been there in person before for classes, so it might be easier to get around? How will they just assign me a roommate if I don’t put one down, randomly?

About Financial Aid
Hi all. I am a prospective student for MS in Computer Engineering for the Fall 2021 batch at Tandon School Of Engineering. I have gotten an admission recently. I have a few doubts about the financial aid at the university.

1. How much does a TA pay  on average? How hard is it to get a TA?
2. How much is the living expense in the area if I decided to live off campus?
3. I have received a small scholarship of $8k a year, but is it possible to get a bigger scholarship if I perform well? 
4. How are the job prospects for the program after graduation?

Thanks in advance for answering the questions.

Admitted to NYU (MS in CS). Need some advice/tips.
Hi All,

Few days back I got my acceptance letter from NYU, and I'm really considering to attend the college. I'm an international student so I'll be traveling to the US this fall. I had few questions regarding housing and life in NY, that I hope I can get the answers to (or atleast what I should expect) on this sub.

1. What would be the best place to look for housing? Few of my friends studying in nearby universities suggested finding rooms in New Jersey, Brooklyn etc. but I am not that familiar with the places. If possible you can also put and estimate on the average rent per week.

2. Which on campus jobs should I consider (or avoid) in NYU? I'll be coming on an F-1 visa, so I can't work off campus during my first academic year.

3. How easy/difficult it is to get jobs either during OPT or post graduation? I know it heavily depends on my performance and my knowledge, but I just wanted to know the general opinion on this.

4. I have never traveled to any country before and I'm not completely aware of the culture there (all I have is references from Hollywood movies and TV shows), so what are the obvious things that I should completely avoid? Mistakes that foreigners commonly make and you wish they already knew. (I'm from India if that helps)


I hope my questions made sense and I'm looking forward to your responses 😊.
--------------------------------------------------
Is NYU Shanghai the “easy” school to get in for NYU? Is it selective/a good school?
First off, I’m really sorry if this question offends anyone! I’m just a really clueless high school senior who had no idea about anything.

So I got accepted to NYU Shanghai and I thought that was okay. I don’t really know much about the school (or anything related to college in general). All I know is that since it’s relatively new, the student size is not that big. So the 7% acceptance rate on google doesn’t really mean that much I guess? 

Parents talk to other parents and my mom learned from her “friend” that NYU Shanghai is not that selective as the 7% acceptance rate implies. Basically her friends said that it’s not that good as NYU the main one. 

But then on YouTube people said that it’s the opposite and to be admitted basically means that you were selected against many other students (which is good).

Honestly whether or not the school is “selective” “prestigious” is not my concern but it would help me greatly in convincing my parents about which school I want to go to.

anyone else returning in the fall and worried about finding friends?
i was a spring admit in 2020, so i was on campus for literally like a month before quarantine hit and we were sent home. i've been home ever since, lost all the friends i made since i was gone for so long.

when i get back, i'm gonna be a junior already (!?). i'm dorming, but it's already so hard to make friends at nyu and i feel like this is whole situation makes it even harder

anyone else?

Is anybody taking intro to chem?
I am an upcoming freshman majoring in nursing and I am curious if anybody is taking chemistry right now? I heard it's mostly in lecture style with a large group of students and I am just curious how easy it is to retain the info? Do Professors answer questions during class time? Also, lemme know the good chem professors at NYU. Any advice for how y'all take notes or how to study for the science courses in general?

opinions about the yeronisos/cypress trip
I'm just looking for more info about the summer trip to Yeronisos excavation site in Cypress with Professor Joan Breton Connelly. I've heard it's great, life-changing, etc. But I've also heard great warnings about it. That it's essentially boot-camp, and not to go on it if you "love yourself." I have not taken a class with Connelly, and she's held really, really highly in the eyes of the university but I've heard she's pretty selfish and full of herself? I have no idea. I've heard all sorts of things. Hoping I can hear from an alum of the program perhaps.

NYU Courant MS in CS | Worried about evening classes
Hi folks, I'm recently admitted to MSCS program at NYU Courant. NYU Courant was one of my top choices, but just yesterday, I noticed something odd about the class schedule: most of the classes are between **5:10 and 9:00 PM**! I understand that this is because of part-time students, but it actually got me a bit worried, because I'm an international student, which means I will be a full-time student. This seems like a really unusual schedule.. Is there any full-time/international Courant MSCS student who wants to share his/her experience related to this situation?

Hey everyone! So I was awarded the tandon scholarship, and I was wondering if I would continue to receive the same amount throughout my 4 years, or would the amount fluctuate lower next year?

Spanish Courses at NYU Madrid
Hi everyone,

I was thinking about taking Intermediate Spanish II over the summer to get my requirement done with, and I noticed that there is an NYU Madrid course for this summer taught by Susana Albert that meets for half an hour less than the NYU WSQ Intermediate Spanish II. I was wondering if anyone has any experience taking a language course at a study abroad location and can comment on it. Also, if anyone has had Susana Albert and has any advice about her class I'd appreciate it. Thanks!

Where should I rent an apartment as a sophomore student?
Hi guys,

I'll be a sophomore student this fall and plan to rent an apartment with my friend(s). I'm not currently in New York (and I only visited NYC as a tourist three years ago), and I'm an international student who literally has no idea about the city's geography. Let's say if my budget is around 1.5k-2.5k per month, and a friend (probably two, but not sure at this moment) also has a similar budget, so that makes a total budget of 3k-5k per month--do you think it is possible for us to find a 2-bedroom apartment in a safe neighborhood that is not too far away from school? A friend suggested apartments in LIC, but will that be too far away or too inconvenient?

thx!

Pass/Fail
I want to request for one of my elective courses to be graded pass/fail but I’m worried about one thing. On the pass/fail form it states “I am aware that courses with pass/fail grades do not satisfy major, minor, or general education requirements.” I contacted my advisor and she told me that that only applies to requirements for *double majors* or minors.

To be honest, I’m just feeling hesitant to trust my advisor on this because this is my final semester before I graduate and I need the two elective credits from this class for my degree. She says it’s only applicable to double majors but the form doesn’t specify that. I’m not double majoring. Does anyone know for sure she’s right? Btw, I’m Tisch.

I got a bad case of the lonelys
I am junior and I have no friends. I had some friends freshman year but I completely lost touch with them sophomore year and haven't made any friends since. I was already dealing with isolation issues before I came to NYU and they've just gotten way worse and obviously covid has not helped. Im worried that it'll be even more difficult to find friends now that I am Junior and people have already established groups. Is anyone else in the same boat? Did anyone only find friends junior or senior year?

Any one else doing bad academically rn?
Last spring semester and this recent fall semester motivated me to do my best and I have, but the burnout is real right now especially with no spring break, I estimate having an A+ in one class, B+ in another, B in another, and then the last two... I think I will either fail or barely get a C in them and I am scared out of my mind. Worst comes to worst I will either do P/F and just retake them in the summer if I fail, but this entire situation would have been avoided in the first place if the university actually treated us like human beings and not money bag machines.

(CAS) Mathematics major in Courant advice
I was recently admitted to CAS and I am having great difficulty picking between NYU and another top 20 university. I know that the applied math program is highly ranked (Maybe even #1?), so I assume it carries some amount of prestige. My ultimate goal is getting into a good Ph. D program in an applied field and go into industry either during or after I complete graduate studies. Does the prestige NYU offer carry over to grad school admissions or does it mainly apply to getting into industry straight out of undergrad? I also know that I personally would enjoy a more traditional campus experience a bit more, but I am willing to stomach that for superior academics

More specific questions about the math major:

Is it easy to get into research?

How are the class sizes?

How much of a difference does the honors program have in graduate admissions?



Sorry for the overload of questions I am just stuck in a big dilemma so any help at all is extremely appreciated, and if you have any other experiences you want to share that might be helpful regarding courant or NYU in general please do so!

NYU Social Life
hi! i'm an incoming freshman for fall 2021 and i was wondering how hard it is to make friends at NYU. 

throughout highschool i stuck with the same friends I'd had since elementary + middle school so I don't really remember the last time I approached someone new.

I heard that NYU doesn't have much socialization or partying going on. Also, I'm not sure how the dorms will be like due to COVID so I'm assuming I won't have much of an opportunity to socialize there either.

I would love to know what advice you guys have for making friends, especially as an introvert. my current strategy involves waiting for an extrovert to approach me first but i don't think that's very reliable haha

Forgot to submit CSS, what are my chances at aid now?
After a 1:1 session with a financial aid counselor at NYU, I learned that I would have gotten merit aid along with my acceptance to CAS' honors program if only I had filled out my CSS when it was due two months ago. That being said, I'm also in an awkward position where I don't qualify for need-based aid but will not be able to afford NYU. I've heard that merit aid at NYU is--to put it bluntly--shit, and that I'd just cheated myself out of it JUST by not submitting my CSS by the hard deadline really bums me out since NYU has always been one of my dreams. I've already contacted the financial aid office again with an email to see if there's anything I can do about this; is there any hope? Thanks so much!

How can I overcome a burnout and rebuild discipline?
I’m a current freshman in LS. For the past semester I’ve been struggling through getting my work done and preserving through my classes. This is my school dream, so I thought i’d everything in my power to succeed right? Wrong (unfortunately). I knew I had the procrastination of an average student (does all work but misses a few deadlines/lateness), but it became more than that. I thought I could blame it on seasonal depression but that can’t be right. I’m not a lazy student but the motivation to keep me going is diminishing. I am wondering if any students (whether a fellow freshman, upperclassman, or graduate) has experienced anything similar? And how did you overcome it?

How is third North?
Hello, I’m an incoming freshmen. Since the last few weeks, I keep hearing “rumors” about how third north is “a party house, always loud, and full of std”. All the “critics” that I have heard so far are from incoming freshmens who haven’t been into the campus. So I’m not 100% sure if that is true. I was wondering if anyone who went to 3rd north, could tell me if the dorm is actually a party house and is always very loud? And how is it there? 
I’m someone who likes to party sometimes but also need some moment to chill lol.
I put 3rd north as my fourth preference and do not know if I should just remove it from my list. 
Thank you very much 🙏🙏

BS/MS in accounting program at Stern
So I recently read into the Stern program where you can get a masters in accounting in just 1 extra summer at NYU, thus paying just 30K extra for this masters degree.

For someone interested to head into high finance, would this make sense? Also, what are the pros and cons for this program in general? From the surface, a masters degree for just one extra summer and only 30K seems like a great deal, so please enlighten me.
--------------------------------------------------
does anyone know of any ridiculously easy polisci/race theory/public policy classes at nyu? emphasis on easy. you think a class is easy? i’m talking easier than that.
i’ve worked incredibly hard in college and i’m ready to retire for my last year and take classes related to my major (gallatin gang) but so easy that i can just coast by and do things like knit or frolick or whatever my heart desires

on a serious note my professors fucked me in the ass this semester and i literally just need people to give me some easy ass classes

Delay in Internal transfer decision
I have applied for CAS but haven’t received a decision yet. Many of my peers started getting decisions around a week ago. Since summer registration already started, should I assume that I am getting rejected that is why they don’t care if I get my decision after the summer registration period? I am really stressed out right now. I know this is dumb question. But if anyone ever was same boat as me who got their decision pretty later in the April, is it possible to share experience? Does delayed decision mean it’s a no?

International student for bio MSC needing advices
Context: I applied to Bio Ph.D. at NYU and got accepted as MSC as an international student with genomic lab experience and publication 

There are only days left before I have to decide and honestly, I have no clue what to do. I am hesitating between two schools, tufts (same major) and nyu. Both are great but which has a better track for me to continue my Ph.D. at the corresponding institution?  Also is there is anyone who knows about bio MSc or Ph.D. please let me know and I would love to connect with you. (For those who know) Which lab at NYU is recommended for someone like me? How likely is it that I can directly be admitted to the Ph.D. program at NYU？

Commuting First Year
I was recently accepted into NYU Tisch for drama. It's my dream school, so I am doing my best to make it work, even though it doesn't seem likely because of cost. One idea I had to make it more affordable was by commuting from home for the first year. I live in NJ, with about a 45-50 minute train ride to Penn station, and then I would need to take the subway as well. Is this commute do-able? Does anyone with a similar commute have any advice?

Hey everybody! I'm currently looking for people who would be interested in getting a two bedroom apartment with me around NYC for the Fall 2021 semester. I've started looking for apartments, but I can't move until August (i.e. I'm hoping for a move in date of August 1st), so my goal is to first find a roommate who I can then go apartment hunting with. I'm currently located in the Brooklyn area and I've leased an apartment before so I have experience with  apartment hunting. 

A bit more info about me: I'm currently a junior at NYU, and a double major in Political Science and GLS. I have a cat who will be a year old by the time we move— she's a very playful and social orange tabby who will be moving with me. I work from home as a tutor/teacher so I'm home most weekdays, though that will definitely change if NYU opens up again \[then I'll be out most of the time at school or work\]. 

I'm eager to start talking to potential roommates so we have plenty of time to talk and make sure we get to know each other before deciding anything. Please dm me asap for more info!

[Megathread] Prospective Students, Applications, and Admissions
Dear prospective students,

We appreciate your interest in NYU! Feel free to ask questions about the school and the application process in this weekly post!

Do take advice about your chances of admission with a grain of salt:

* An application is a holistic process and we can’t see everything you submit
* We  don’t actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what  they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence which often isn't the  best
* Please direct information-sensitive questions to the [NYU Admissions Office](https://www.nyu.edu/footer/contact-us.html)
* NYU's admission rate drops every year and standards go up, so even the  anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's  applications

Good luck!

Data Science Major at CAS Questions!
I'm an incoming freshman at CAS this year and I'm quite interested in the new Data Science Major here at NYU, if you guys could answer some of these questions, I'll really appreciate it!

1. I applied and got accepted into CAS as an intended Computer Science Major, how easy would it be to change to a Data Science Major?
2. I couldn't find any information on the electives available, is there a page somewhere that have all the electives that a DS major can take?
--------------------------------------------------
IS IT TOO LATE FOR TO APPLY FOR SCHOLARSHIPS??? This is literally the deal breaker for me :(
Ok so yes I know I was dumb and I didn’t prepare well. The thing is, my whole family and I thought that I would attend my state college since I have a parent who works there so my tuition is free. As a result, I didn’t apply to any scholarships for any other schools since I thought I wouldn’t attend there anyways.

Now I applied to NYU shanghai but I didn’t really think I’d get in or anything. It was like a “why not” decision. However after learning more about the school now, I’ve realized that it provides a lot of opportunities that I personally like. I feel like NYUSH is a better fit for me than my state school. But since I didn’t apply to any scholarships, I saw that damn, school is expensive. Financial aid is also very very little.  (Honestly I don’t really understand the financial aid/scholarships stuff that much). 

So I know it’s like really last minute but are there any scholarships I could apply to that would help reduce the cost of my tuition. If there’s any possible way I can lessen my tuition to a decent amount, I might be able to attend NYUSH.
--------------------------------------------------
Serious question
So I got accepted into NYU and I wanted to ask if I’m allowed to jerk off in the dorm showers or do I need to do it in my dorm, but then my roommate will be there 😏
--------------------------------------------------
How do I contact my academic advisor and when do I register for classes as a freshman?
I'm an incoming freshman, and saw on the academic calendar that registration for fall classes is on May 24, but is it different for freshmen? Also, will my advisor reach out to me or should I contact them first? Thanks!

Incoming International Student Needing Financial Advice
I got admitted to NYU Stern last week and it has been my dream school for a long time. However, I didn't receive sufficient aid and would have to take loans to pursue my degree. It would be really expensive, but I love the school, so I really want to attend. Can you guys give me advice about positions or grants at NYU or any other opportunities?
--------------------------------------------------
How many weeks before classes start do dorms open for move-in?
I'm an international student, and I'm trying to get some tickets early since it's cheaper. I did some research and the opening dates come out in July, which is much too late. I'm just trying to get an idea of when to move in without being stranded or being too late.

Goddard Hall Applicant Questions
I'm an incoming freshman filling out my housing application. I'm interested in Goddard Hall, but I had a few questions that I couldn't find answers to on their website.

First, are we allowed to pick our own streams, or do we get placed into them based on what we write in our essays? The Goddard info page says "once accepted to the Residential College at Goddard Hall you will receive an e-mail with your Residential College community placement information in early June", which suggests that we don't get to pick our own streams, but I can't really tell for sure.

My next question is kind of related: are we allowed to attend events hosted by other streams? For example, if I'm in the Inequality & Difference stream, would I still be able to attend a show with the All the World's a Stage stream, or is that not allowed?

Thanks in advance everyone!
--------------------------------------------------

Hi, I was recently admitted to NYU Stern for CO2025 and I’m hoping to pursue a double concentration in Finance and Computing/Data Science. I was wondering how heavy the workload will be for pursing two concentrations, and will it help if I have a lot of AP credits and skip some classes? Thanks!

Good orchestra or chamber music opportunities?
Hi!

I was wondering if there are any outside orchestra programs NYU students take part in because the university symphony isn't that ambitious. I'm not going to major in my instrument (string), but I've been competitive with it throughout high school. I want the peer competition/access to some good faculty and so far, I think my future plans will involve my instrument. I'll probably find some community orchestra/chamber music program if there's not any preexisting program with really good faculty that college students can join. I know I'll probably have to get creative to seek out what I want, but I want to see if there are easier options ig.

internal transfer from gallatin to cas?
hey guys! i was recently accepted to nyu gallatin, but i’m really regretting not applying to cas. four months ago, i thought gallatin was the perfect place for me and that it could encompass my many academic interests. however, the independence of gallatin now scares me and i have a much more comprehensive understanding of what i want to major in, and cas seems to fit my interests more. i’m considering transferring from gallatin to cas my sophomore year of college, and i have a bunch of questions now. if anyone could answer even one of these questions, i’d be eternally grateful.
-is it hard to transfer to cas?
-will i graduate in time (4 years)?
-can i apply for the presidential scholars program in cas once i transfer?
-can i double major or will i not have enough credits in four years?
gallatin also gave me a “gallatin scholarship”, which amounts to $20900 a year. without this scholarship, i wont be able to afford nyu. i asked the financial aid office if the scholarship was for 4 years and transferrable, as i didnt think it was, and this was their reply:

“Thank you for your inquiry. You will continue to receive for subsequent academic years the amount of scholarship you received for your first year (subject to the availability of funds), as long as you are a full-time student (at least 12 points). Students who are enrolled less than full-time, but at least half-time (between 6-11 points), and are otherwise eligible will have their scholarship prorated. Also, your scholarship is transferable to other traditional schools within NYU.”

this seems too good to be true LMAO does anyone know if this is true? as in if i transfer to cas my gallatin scholarship will come with me? pls help!

prospective trans student - dorm advice
hi! i know that the dorm policy for NYU is based off of legal sex OR you have the option of selecting gender identity dorming. i’m not really interested in the latter. however, i’m a ftm trans guy and would prefer to room with other men. my drivers license had my identifier as male while my birth certificate still says female. they are both government issues IDs. would my license count as a government ID that would allow me in the male dorms?

When will Bobst be available 24 hours
As places like planet fitness start reopening for 24 hours a day, will Bobst library soon be fully available as well?

Thanks!

Types of Jobs
What kinds of jobs does the Wasserman Centre help the students in looking for ? Are they only course related jobs or even odd jobs ? I got accepted to CAS with a major in Computer Science. I’ll probably transfer to stern in my second semester or maybe in the second year. What kind of jobs do you think I might get as a CAS student? I have zero work experience and after I finish high school I am thinking of learning a bit of Python. I have studied Java for 5 years now.

Also how long do I have to wait to get a job? I’m an international student so I could not apply for the work-study scheme and also I receive no financial aid.
--------------------------------------------------
freshman dorming
i committed to nyu last week and will be living on campus this fall semester and i have no idea what i need to bring to campus next year. what are some essential items i should bring and what are things that aren't necessarily essential but would be convenient for me to bring? thank you so much!

Possible incoming NYU Student - Please help me
Hey guys!

Im ain international student who's considering NYU currently. My intended major is the joint major of Comptuer Science and Economics at CAS. I've already been accepted at decent Canadian Universities for Software Engineering - which are significantly cheaper and I graduate with no debt. However - I'd give anything to study Economics and NYU is my only hope to do so. If I come to NYU - It's going to place a fair amount of financial pressure on my family and place me in about 60-80k in debt, and its a huge price to pay just to study Economics. I know I sound selfish wanting to study Economics despite how heavy the cost seems here - but it seems like a better alternative to studying software engineering which Im barely passionate about and may end up dropping out of. I was wondering what are the job prospects likebstraight out of college with a joint major in Compsci and Econ? Is all this going to be worth it? 

I'd appreciate any guidance and advice. 
Cheers!



Edit: Thank you everyone for your comments. I think Ive gotten the general message that NYU isin't worth the debt and its also selfish to burden my family financially just for a bachelors. I almost feel kind of free now as in there's a weight lifted off of me which was all this uncertainty about NYU, which I felt like I still would've ended up attending simply because of the prestige. I'm leaning much more heavily towards getting a software engineering degree in Canada now I guess - and maybe Ill get an MBA with a finance concentration to pursue my love of Economics at another time in life! There's plenty of time anyways (:

NYU Tandon advice
Thanks in advance for your help!

I got accepted in NYU Tandon for a master in CS.

I was really enthusiastic since I assumed it to be in the Manhattan campus but then I found out that it is in Brooklyn. The fact that the campus is in Brooklyn is not an issue at all if it wasn't for the reddit reviews about it.

In short, I read many people complaining about how the social life sucks, how is not that comfortable going to central campus although there's the free shuttle and all the "gaming culture" stories. I'm extremely academic focused but I enjoy having an active social life, parties, clubs...

Most of the opinions I read on reddit are a few years old and since Tandon is continuously changing I'd like to have fresh advice.

1) How is the nightlife? Social life, parties, clubs.   
2) Is it comfortable to go to Washington square? Would I have the constant feeling of missing out something of the New York Experience by being in NYU Tandon?   
3) is Tandon better than Courant for someone with industry focus? or is there not much difference? is it common to work for FANG or at least getting interviews?   
4) does it feel like to be in a competitive environment surrounded by really bright minds or is it a normal university where it's easy to stand out?

I'm sorry if some of the questions are naive but I've never been in the US or NY and this would be a life changing decision. Also, if someone studied MS CS it would be good to hear also about the programme.

any Canadian students attending NYU this upcoming fall? Concerns about getting vaccinated?
I will be attending grad school at NYU this fall. I wanted to see if there are other Canadian students who will be moving to NYC and what your plans look like right now given the pandemic. Nyu is likely planning for in-person classes as I have heard. 

US has been doing well in terms of vaccinating people but Canada has been awful, especially Ontario so I’m worried I may not get both doses in time to move there. It’s my first time moving by myself so kind of overwhelmed with everything and the uncertainty of things, anyone else in the same boat?
--------------------------------------------------
Covid testing: hearing about false positives?
Are you hearing about many false positives in the NYU testing system? Any stories about that? Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------
How NYU Tandon Computer Science differs from Computer Engineering in terms of research and job prospect?
hi, I received admit from NYU Tandon for MS in Computer Engineering as an international student with $6000 scholarship per year. I have background in CS (completed BCA Hons. with first class and MSc. in Information Science with gpa 4) and I really have least interest in hardware related stuffs. I have applied to MS in CS but received admit for MS in CE instead. I am interested in joining the industry after my MS as software engineer or developer or in some research positions.

Now, I really need to clear some confusions about the Computer Engineering program.

1)  I am confused about how CE grads are treated by the companies while competing with the CS grads during interview? I have seen in the NYU Tandon placement report that lots of Companies hires CE grads (but they didn't provided actual numbers) in positions like Software developer, Software Engineer, AI Engineer etc. 

2) There are courses like ML, RL, DS, Advanced ML etc. in electives. which are basically CS level courses but tagged with ECE-GY and there are only 2 hardware core courses. Now, I am keenly interested in ML/DL and MS CE has ML courses. Hence, is it advisable to study CE only for ML? 

3) If I choose MS CE only because of ML/DL/RL (I am willing to do research in RL during MS) , will it help me to secure a software engineer position in the industry (preferably in Google, Facebook etc.)? 

4) How hard is it to get the above mentioned courses? If I don't get these courses I will be left with some hardware and robotics courses which I really don't want to study. 

5) I have admit from Stevens for MS CS without scholarship. So, which one would be better in terms of job opportunities? MS CS from Stevens or MS CE from NYU?
--------------------------------------------------
If I do an internal transfer will I lose my scholarship?
Hello! I have a Steinhardt scholarship but I’m really interested in the animation and game design programs over at Tisch and I’m wondering: if I successfully transfer, will I be able to keep the same scholarship amount? (My family is not very wealthy, so it impacts my decisions quite a bit)
--------------------------------------------------
Flexible credit option?
Sorry if this has been asked before but I just wanted to clarify: 
If I took 16 credits last semester and I’m taking 16 credits this semester, but I want to withdraw from a 4 credit class so it would only be 12 credits this semester, would I be able to retake that class during the summer using the flexible credit option? Thanks in advance for any help !

Financial Aid
I know some people had their tuition covered? Does NYU base it off your parent's income or your grades? How's the financial aid office at NYU? Are the staff there nice? How likely are they going to provide more aid? Does the scholarship they provide stay consistent throughout the four years?
--------------------------------------------------
Is Tandon still as bad as people say?
I recently got into Tandon. I applied without realizing that Tandon was a fairly new addition to NYU, which I now realize was a very big mistake on my part. Now I'm starting to think it's actually a much lower tier school compared to main NYU. So I have some questions:

1. Are the professors and networking opportunities worse than in main NYU?
2. Is it possible to be involved in both campuses?
3. Is it hard/ worth it to transfer to CAS as a CS major considering you're losing the head start of freshman year?
4. All in all, does Tandon offer the same experience as other colleges in NYU such as CAS?

I was so happy, and now I'm suddenly so disappointed. I don't know what to think. Thanks in advance!
--------------------------------------------------
Individual school acceptance rate announcements
Do they announce the individual NYU school acceptance rate statistics anytime for the admitted students before it is officially posted online (which seems to take approximately a year from actual decisions)? Just seeing how the acceptance rates in general have fallen so heavily across the country, this just sparks my curiosity, especially considering how stern specifically rose up to 13% last year!
--------------------------------------------------
transferring from NYU Shanghai to NYU New York
I know the likelihood of transferring between campuses is very low but if anyone on here has transferred from NYUSH to NYU can you tell me the “valid reason” you provided that allowed you to transfer? I’m not sure what they mean when they say you need a good reason to switch campuses
--------------------------------------------------
How do you find others to study with?
Hey guys, I made a quick survey to learn a bit more about how students go about finding others to study with and was hoping you guys could help me out. The survey is to help me gauge if a platform that I'm currently working on, to make it easier for students to find others to study with, is something that others would utilize. If throughout your college experience you've ever had the need to look for others to study with, please consider taking this quick survey, the feedback is highly appreciated.

NYU Intl Relations Major
Hello everyone,

I was recently accepted into the LS core with plans to switch into CAS my junior year! I intend on majoring in International Relations! Does anyone have any experience with the program + your opinion on it? Thank you so much!! I'll also likely double major in Middle Eastern Studies, if anyone has any knowledge regarding that as well. 😊
--------------------------------------------------
Summer Course Questions
I was just asking how the experience was for anyone who:

- Took Data Structures with Prof Douglas Moody
- Took Linear Algebra
- Took Expressive Cultures

Any feedback would be great because it would help me decide which courses I’ll take this summer. Thank you!
--------------------------------------------------
Do I actually need to pay all these indirect costs?
I recently got into Stern. My NYU fin aid offer said I have 718$ for books and supplies, $1,132 for transportation, and $2,846 for personal expenses. 

Is there any way I can cut that books/supplies cost down? 

And for transportation, what’s is that money for? Is there like a bus system I’m paying for? 

And what even are personal expenses? Do I actually have to spend that much?

THANK YOU

Rant: I'm screwed
A week ago my mom tested positive for COVID after a bad cough two weeks ago (she is asymptomatic since around the 30th). The same day I got this super-hard homework that I just can't figure out that was due today. Now my phone is broken so I can't go to class. Just my luck.

Can my admissions get revoked for cancelling AP exams?
I got into Stern back in December and recently discovered that the school doesn't let you translate AP Mirco test scores into credits. I see no point to taking the exam, but I did say in my application that I would do it. Does NYU pay attention to whether you take AP exams or not and if I were to cancel my AP Micro exam, would it serve as grounds for my admission to be revoked?

Question about NYU Shanghai
Hi! I got into NYU Shanghai for class of 2025 and I wanted to ask anyone who studies or studied there a few questions.

I, first of all, would love to attend and I'm committing to NYUSH but I wanted to know some career related things. I would of course be an International student and I heard you’re not eligible to work with your student visa outside of campus so you can only get jobs within campus? Will that hinder getting any experience for your field and is it that you can only do unpaid internships outside the campus?

And especially, what about after graduation? Will it be difficult to get a job in Shanghai after graduating, which is what I want to do. Will it be difficult to remain there? I live in Abu Dhabi actually, but I would want to remain in Shanghai if I dont go for post-grad elsewhere, will it be hard? Thank you!

Check from NYU didn’t come in mail?
I received money from the CRRSAA covid relief grant back in March and I haven’t received a check in the mail for it yet. I (very stupidly) didn’t sign up for direct deposit but I thought it would be fine since I’ve gotten checks from NYU mailed before. 

Do I just call bursar and tell them I never got the check in the mail? Would they give it to me now and can they tell if I’m telling the truth? Also will be signing up for direct deposit now, learned my lesson).

Any NYU Marketplace Services?
Hi NYU reddit! I'll be moving back to my country and I have some stuff that I want to get rid of that some current students may want. Are there any groups for NYU students to buy/sell stuff? I would give most of the stuff to Goodwill, but I want to let NYU students have a look at them first, since I have things like old lab coats.

NYU Internal Transfer
Hey, I applied to internal transfer to cas with a 3.5 gpa. I saw a few people get notified today that they got in, but I haven’t gotten any emails or updates on my portal or by email. Does this mean I got rejected or is it coming out in waves ?
--------------------------------------------------
I think I’m getting cold feet
NYU was my dream school for years then I stopped thinking about it (partly because I don’t want to be too close to any family members and I have some in NYC). I ended up applying because I felt some people were basically making fun of me for even considering it. While writing the essay, I fell in love with it again. Slightly over a week ago, I got the news that I had been accepted but I wasn’t expecting it so I had already started planning out my life in one of the others schools I got into. After a week, my dad and I decided it would probably be best to commit to NYU. The only problem is NYU is basically the opposite of the other school so I can’t even compare them fairly. I just feel like I’m making one of the most important decisions of my life and I’m mostly sure I want to commit but I’m still very nervous. Did anyone else feel this way when committing? If yes, how did it work out?

Edit: thanks for all the advice! I paid the deposit about an hour ago :)

CAS Scholarship changes
Hi, I got the CAS scholarship this year, which I know is both academic and needs-based, however, my father made a lot more in 2020 because of unemployment with the 600$ per month. Will my CAS scholarship be rescinded or decrease my sophomore year?

Gap Year Questions/Advice
Hi guys! I was recently admitted to NYU Tandon and have a couple of questions about taking a gap year. 

1. Financial aid is the most important factor for me tbh. Fortunately, as of right now I can attend NYU for free as a commuter student. If I take a gap year, will this affect my financial aid in any way?

2. Has NYU sent any updates on what next year is going to look like? Is it still going to be fully remote, back to normal, or a combination of both? 

3. Do you guys think a gap year would be helpful to better figure out what I want to pursue going into the future? Throughout high school, I was set on pre-med but after a rather difficult realization, I don't think it's the way for me to go. I'm kinda lost on where I see myself in the future and am not completely sure about pursuing engineering. 

4. For those of you who have already taken a gap year at NYU, please let me know how your experience was! Pros? Cons? Do you regret it? What are some things that most people don't know about the process? 

Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks in advance :)

How many credits can I come into Stern with?
I’ve take a bunch of AP tests and I plan to take some classes this summer to get like 8 credits. How much can I actually use on my stern degree requirements?

Also, can I only use these credits on electives? Can I use any on actual stern core classes? (i’m pretty sure I can for math and natural science but anything else?)

THANK YOU

NYU for premed?
Hi everyone! I'm a high school senior who got into NYU recently as a Global Public Health major and I had a couple of questions about the NYU premed experience

\-Would you recommend NYU for premed? Is it worth it? (Not factoring in the expenses) 

\-How would you describe the overall premed culture at NYU? It is welcoming and helpful or toxic and cutthroat? 

\-How easy is it to get clinical volunteering/research opportunities at the med school and/or hospitals in the city?

\-Are there any programs that facilitate research on campus?

\-How useful is it to have an affiliated med school? Can I do research under the med school profs? 

\-How hard is the grading at NYU? Some people talk about grade deflation and others talk about grade inflation. Can someone speak to this?

\-What is the quality of professors? Does it fluctuate wildly between classes? Is it consistently not great? consistently good? Any objectively unfair ones?

\-What classes do I need to watch out for or are cutthroat?

\-I've heard the classes at NYU are huge, is that ultimately detrimental? Is it hard to get in touch or meet with professors?

\-How is the quality of the NYU premed advising? Are there any GPA requirements for the NYU Pre-health Committee Letter

\-Would you say the NYU gen ed requirements are a burden to get through?  
\-Are there any premed programs or opportunities that you felt really helped you at NYU?

\-I'm really interested in pursuing the GPH/Bio major, can someone speak about their experience in this major? What is the quality of the professors in the GPH department? Is the workload a lot? Are there any research opportunities in the GPH department?

\-There is a language requirement. How many semesters of language do I have to take? What is the highest level equivalent to in terms of high school language classes? AP?

do I still need to show up to a class if I requested a withdrawal?
I've just submitted a class withdrawal request and the class begins in a few hrs.

Do I still need to show up? I'm 100% certain about my decision and I don't wanna take this class anymore.
--------------------------------------------------
are a lot of people placed in single studio dorms right now?
if im paying more the more expensive single dorms, does that mean i'll be placed in a single studio (just me in the dorm + a kitchen and bathroom), or just that i'll have my own room in a suite with other people? 

i'm just wondering how common it is to be placed in a dorm just by myself, but also with a kitchen and bathroom lol

Confused with application process

What policy for Fall 21? No Go Local?
According to the email I received a few weeks ago, it seems that go local is not available in the fall. If want to study at other places, one must apply for study away. I waited anxiously for the result, because the visa and the vaccine are very very time-consuming.

Tandon Freshmen Dorms
So it looks like I’m probably going to Tandon and I was wondering if it’s likely to get a single dorm (or a private whatever they call it). I really value being by myself and especially since I’m going for engineering I don’t want to deal with any of the drama that comes with a roommate. I was wondering what the pros and cons for Othmer and Clark are :)
