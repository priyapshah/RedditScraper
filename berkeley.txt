Berkeley Transfer Discord Server
Hello everyone, 

I have a Discord server dedicated to transfers for Berkeley Fall 2021 and Spring 2022. We have a good community of transfers so far. You can look for roommates here and make friends, just be sure to role yourself to which department you got admitted into or whether you are on the waitlist or not. If you're not a transfer but just want to help give us advice as a student already at Berkeley, that would be very helpful. Overall, the server has great vibes. Come join us!

Residency thing
Hey guys,
I’m an incoming freshman, and I submitted my residency form on April 30, but it was still showing the incomplete sign, even on may 1st morning. Idk why it was doing the that. The same thing happened with my housing app on April 28 when I submitted it, it didn’t say it was done until April 30. Am I screwed? Will I have to pay out of state tuition because Ik I did it before the deadline but it was still saying it was incomplete

How competitive?
Hello, 
I'm a student at UCLA and I'm wondering how competitive is UCB? I've heard all the depression/Stanford reject memes and stuff but I've never actually asked how hard Berkeley is? Would you say Berkeley students are on par with students from Stanford or Harvard? This isn't a joke question and I was actually thinking about going to Berkeley because the campus is gorgeous but I ultimately wanted to live in Los Angeles. Thank you :)

Admissions Crisis
Hey all,

I was admitted to UC Berkeley as a transfer student for fall 2021 into the College of Letters and Sciences (I applied as a Mathematics major). I'm writing this post just to see what kind of advice I can get on what to do next.

Basically, I applied to Berkeley literally JUST for fun, as I currently attend UCI which I'm not necessarily unhappy at. Unfortunately, between the time period I applied to Berkeley and now, I have made the decision to change my major. Additionally, I got some terrible grades (a D- in a class) winter quarter and I'm worried they will rescind my offer.

I guess my general questions would just be 1) How likely is it that they will rescind my offer after seeing that grade, and 2) After being accepted as a math major here, would it be unreasonable to be able to change my major upon arrival if I somehow do end up going here?

Thanks !

French 4 help!
Hey bears,

I took French in high school for 4 years, so that places me in French 4. However, I have not done anything in French for the past year and a half due to me graduating high school, and I'm sure high school French is nothing compared to college French.

 Since I am a Polecon intended major, I have to take a language class but I plan to graduate in 3 years, so I can't start from French 2/3 again in order to save time. Is there anyone out there who took French 4 without that being that great in French, and how did you find the class?

Housing for Freshman

It says housing isn't due until May 2nd, which is today, so today should be the last day to submit right? am I missing something?

Please help! Forgot to submit my SLR!!!
Hello!! I committed to Berkeley but was having trouble logging in with Cal Central for a while (something happened with the 2 step verification process) and I forgot to submit my SLR which was due today

edit: just filled out the form and emailed them and I will call them tomorrow. Lowkey panicking but fingers crossed that I won’t have to pay nonresident tuition :(

rate/comment on my appeal??
Dear Appeals Committee, 
    I screwed up. I left aspects of myself which are so crucial to your understanding of my character out of my application. I know that you might throw this letter out after reading that first sentence, but I bear the blessings of being extremely stubborn and courageous. Berkeley is my dream school, and I will not let it go. I will fight for it over and over. Even if I have to apply year after year, and even if it takes me until graduate school to finally be accepted, I will keep going. 
On to the part you’re actually here for. I was the only girl in elementary and middle school that played basketball, and I had to constantly fight the boys for my chance to do so. I played on city teams every season, and later joined a travel team. When my first high school didn’t allow me to play even after several emails to every coach and principal, I signed up for another season of city ball. Once I transferred to my current school, I immediately joined their team. At Berkeley, I’d like to continue playing recreationally, as well as begin working for your sports teams.
I have amassed a portfolio of writing on humanitarian crises such as child marriage, which I have sent in to magazines and competitions, as well as published on blog websites. I am part of the MyGenMyFight club, which raises awareness about human trafficking. I have dozens of hours of community service, ranging from making blankets for children in need, to making holiday cards and gathering necessities for the homeless. I will continue this path at Berkeley by using its resources to help raise awareness and find solutions for global issues. Studying here will also allow me to minor in global poverty and practice, which will greatly aid my writing and social entrepreneurship, as there is so much real-world experience that comes with the program. Alternatively, I may study gender and women, which will lead to opportunities for me in journalism, politics, and public service. Berkeley also ranks first in California for its English major, which will elevate my writing to a level that commands and directs the attention of all towards humanitarianism. My career will be immensely furthered due to Berkeley, as I will be afforded the opportunity to help the world in a way that I can at no other school. 
Lastly, my transcript was not reported correctly on my application; I received an excused withdrawal due to Covid-19 in Math 104. In addition, I have participated in several academic competitions in the days since I submitted my application, and I have received first place in an event for DECA. I have also maintained high grades, and so I have the honor of wearing a gold robe at graduation. 
When I am admitted to UC Berkeley, I will bring my dedication, passion, and excellence with me. Thank you, and I look forward to seeing you in the fall.

EFC 0 and Off-Campus Housing
Hi everyone,
I lived in on campus housing this year and will be living off campus next year. I was wondering how will be aid be distributed to me?

This year, my housing was done through the school and paid by it.

Ive heard that if your EFC Is 0, you get around 4k a semester to pay for your housing? Is it just deposit to my bank? 

Thanks

How hard is being an econ major here?
I very much am clear that Berkeley is notorious for being academically challenging, but are people always willing to help like in study groups and such? How are opportunities in the area? Are most lower division classes graded on a curve? Also for any econ majors on this subreddit please state how you study, it would be very helpful

How is the collaberatative environment for MCB (Biochem & molecular bio)?
Are peers helpful or is it to each their own, kinda vibe? I've heard that it is competitive because of the curves, I'm not worried about the competition I applied knowing it would be competitive, I'm more concerned with peer interactions. At UCR (where I'm transferring from) everyone is helpful, we have similar curves in our weeder course where only the top 10% get A's, yet most are is still willing to help. I'm just wondering if Berkeley is similar.

I see a lot of people from Berkeley get offers from really good/top companies, and while I've gotten interviews from some of them, I don't get offers. What is it that I am doing wrong and others are not?
I'm a junior with no summer internship offers. Yes, I know it is bad to not have anything as a junior. I guess there is still time as I do see postings from some corporates still up. I have an interview next Tuesday as well, but I'm well aware time is not on my side. 

However, I wanted to get to the point and ask my question. I honestly used to feel bad when I saw a lot of Berkeley classmates on LinkedIn get offers from the Big 4, MBB, FAANG, places of a similar caliber, etc., and just pity myself and feel jealous and not really do anything about it.

Now, however, I am trying to take a different approach, I guess. 

My situation is that I have a decent/varied amount of work experience in *outside* consulting clubs (i.e. not ones at Berkeley) and startups. No famous big-name places, but I am decent at writing resumes and cover letters so I get interviews at pretty decent places. I'm able to show how the experiences, even though they're not from well-known places, can make me a good fit at the company. 

I have never gotten an interview from MBB, the Big 4, or any FAANG companies, but lots of boutique consulting companies, in addition to most, if not all, econ consulting firms I applied to, and some other fairly famous corporates were interested in interviewing me.

I believe my interviewing skills are just below average. I used to struggle with both behavioral and "technical" interviews (cases) but after many, many mock interviews, my behavioral interview skills are probably at least average and maybe slightly above average.  My technical skills, however, remain below average. Additionally, I am naturally a very awkward and nervous person unless I know the other party well, so that doesn't help. I also feel like I don't really know how to navigate professional relationships. 

After improving my behavioral interview skills, I stopped failing the first rounds and got to the second/final rounds. However, I've failed at least 5-6 final rounds so far from famous corporates, a well-known market research company, and an economic consulting firm.

I think the final rounds tend to be more intense technically and I am never sure how to prepare for them, other than reading Glassdoor and trying my best to anticipate the questions that are asked. 

I also don't really attend to apply to as many positions as others do, because even with the limited amount of applications I do, I have at least 1 interview a week. I believe that when I've applied to less places, I am able to send out better quality applications, but I guess not applying as much tends to also limit your chances by not casting a wider net and by also limiting the interviews you get. 

Other than interview skills, which I've already asked multiple Berkeley career counselors, experienced friends, and outside mentors to help me with, what else are they doing that I am not? I don't really think my GPA is holding me back; it's a 3.74.

If it matters, I never joined any consulting or business clubs and don't typically network. I have never networked because I don't really have problems getting interviews. The industries I am interested in are primarily economic consulting and market research, as well as strategy/management consulting and digital marketing.

So...is it just that other Berkeley students are better at interviewing, both behaviorally and technically? Have a narrower focus on what they want to do (as my interests are fairly varied) allowing them to prepare in a more strategic and focused manner? Or do they have a better network than I do? Are there resources they are leveraging that I am not?

Do you have to take Bio1A and Bio1AL in the same semester?
1.) Do you have to take Bio1A and its respective lab together? I'm thinking of taking Bio1A in the Fall and then Bio1AL in the Spring; is this permitted? 

2.) If so, is this advisable? Will I be at a disadvantage if I don't take the lab while taking Bio1A?

Thanks!

Transfer Admission Question
Hi all, I am currently a student at ucsd and got into l & s at Berkeley for transfer for this fall. However, I failed one of my classes during winter quarter (it was a minor class). 

During the quarter I had contracted covid among other difficulties. 

This F violates the conditional acceptance requirements. Is there anyway I can still get into Berkeley?

Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------
Do roommate requests affect my chances of getting the housing I want? Or do you only get matched with your roommate if you both happen to get into your top choice?
For example, if I got into Blackwell but my roommate didn’t and got into Unit 1 instead, would my housing offer then change to Unit 1 to honor my roommate request? Or does the system only match your requested roommate if both of your (available) top choices are the same?

--------------------------------------------------
Does anyone else feel like that when schools closed in March 2020, life became all work and no fun?
I don't know about everyone else, but after the campus shut down and I was forced to move home, I lost all of my fun outlets (food, boba, walking around Berkeley, and using BART to visit other parts of the Bay Area). 

My parents are also fairly abusive and controlling, so with that and COVID, of course, I wasn't able to do anything "fun" at home. I live in a fairly uneventful beach town, so not much to do to begin with, but now I can't even meet up with friends or blow money on food / boba / whatever because my parents are *extremely* financially controlling. It doesn't even matter if I were to buy it with my own money; they'd still think it's a waste of money if it's not bought with coupons. 

So...all I basically did between March 2020 till now was homework, job/internship searching, and wasting time on the Internet. 

Moreover, I feel like I lost out on a lot of memories I could have made at Berkeley. There was a time in my life when I hated this school a lot, but after I made some changes, I started to like my freedom, independence, and all that. 

I mean, comparing my time at Berkeley to my HS experience, I felt like I barely made any memories at Berkeley compared to the ones I made in HS. I hated HS, but at least I felt like I got the full experience - all the good and the bad, and it's sad to say I wasn't able to get that at Berkeley.

I may be heading back for Fall 2021 but I haven't been able to find a suitable short term lease :(

Visiting Berkeley! Any tips on accommodation and sightseeing?
Hey guys and gals!

I'm from Sri Lanka, and I plan to visit Berkeley in September for Porter Robinson's Second Sky concert in Cesar Chavez Park. I'll be there for 3 days as I'm on a tight budget and accommodation is pricy. I'll be AirBnb'ing, so if y'all have any cheaper alternatives, let me know :).

I'll have one day, hopefully two, to check out the sights and also meet a friend who's driving up from Pasadena. Is there anything that I could check out? Anything from Museums to hiking trails, I'm up for it! 

I know this is a long ways ahead, but I like to plan ahead and keep an idea of a plan around so I can prioritize. The cheaper the activities/locations the better! 

Also idk what to look out for and what not to look out for, so please do let me know on what to avoid! This is my first trip to the Americas, so I'm not quite sure what to expect. 

Thanks!

P.S: I'll be vaccinated and authorized for travel by my arrival date. I already have vaccination appointments coming up later this month.

SLR Problems
On my SLR, my parents show up as "adoptive". Unfortunately, I didn't notice this error until I was on the last page, and the SLR system doesn't let you edit previous pages.

Also, the SLR is due may 1st, so should I just submit it lol?

Berkeley housing problem (urgent)

Advice on taking HISTORY 137AC in the summer?
I'm an incoming freshman - US citizen that did HS abroad, so I need to take all of American Cultures, Institutions, and History. I'm strongly thinking of taking History 137AC this summer - I really have nothing to do at home, and the course fulfills all three requirements as well as an upper div H/SS course, so it seems very attractive. My only concern is that I might not do well/it'll be too hard, since I don't know too much about US History, but I think I can P/NP it (right?). What do you think? I'm in COE, if that makes a difference.

Thanks in advance!

How is the Society and Environment major?
Hey there

I’m a incoming transfer who has also been accepted at UCLA and trying to decide if Cal, more specifically the Society and Environment major, is right for me.

Does anyone have first or second hand information about the program and the career opportunities available? I would love to do an internship while studying so after I graduate I can have some job connections. Are there internship opportunities that are widely accessible through the school/major/ professors who can set me on a solid path towards a career or possibly grad school after graduation?

Any advice is helpful, thanks!
--------------------------------------------------
Can't Decide Where to Attend?
Sorry, not sure where to ask this but I'm stuck between UW-Madison Honors Program and Berkeley and I'm really scared that I have to decide today lol. My biggest thing is class sizes tbh, like in UW Honors they purposefully have the kids in really small like 10-15 student classes where u can easily interact with professors, and I'm afraid about the class sizes at Berkeley, so does anyone have any info on whether, in addition to large lectures, Berkeley also has small, discussion-oriented classes I could attend? If they do then I have no problem going to Berkeley. Thanks in advance! :)

Edit: I took the step last night and decided to go to Berkeley! GO BEARS! :)

Is a GPA cap in data science inevitable?
So I was reading about the new CS declaration process for next year's freshman, and thought that everyone who would intent to major in CS but didn't get in wouldn't they just declare data science. Wouldn't this just balloon the number of students majoring in data science? I'm an incoming freshman but as far as I'm concerned data science students can take similar if not the same as CS students. I don't know how data science enrollment works for upper division cs classes, especially for popular ones like cs 170 188 and 189 but wouldn't they just take classes not really fixing the enrollment issues. I feel like data science is going to need a GPA cap if the new CS declaration process takes effect. Good thing Berkeley is getting a data hub they will need it for the increased enrollment.

Getting hit on by Girls -- Advice Request
I (male) have had two experiences getting hit on by girls, and I don't know how to process what I feel. I'm wondering if I can get some advice from you all about why this has happened to me/how I should act because I don't believe my experiences are common at all. The second time around, I felt more agency, but I'm really confused about what I should have done the first time.

The first time it happened, I was with a close friend from a club. Our personalities and ways of talking were completely different; I am known as a diehard optimist, and my friend is equally pessimistic, at least outwardly. We were very close, as she and I would talk into the early morning at times. One day, we hung like we usually would and she turned on some anime, and we watched it, laughing and chatting. She got a blanket for both of us, a common occurrence since she would always appear outside bundled up tightly with two jackets and a scarf. This time, though, she put her legs over my thighs and rubbed me in a really deliberately sexual way. I didn't know what to do, and I froze and tensed up, and then she stopped after a couple of minutes. I didn't see this girl as more than a friend, and I didn't know how to stop her without hurting her feelings. The rest of our hangout felt awkward and wrong. I don't even think my friend wanted me in particular; she would always talk about wanting to cuddle with anyone, and I was just the easiest shot.

I feel like as a guy, I have some sort of responsibility in a platonic friendship with a girl to tell her I'm not interested in being intimate, but I never knew when to say it, until my friend initiated. I'm not even sure if my friend did anything wrong.

EECS16b has no in person lab next fall.
Despite in-person being the default mode and many other courses are having the *opposite* problem of no remote labs. How can labs be done remotely? I heard everyone loathe remote labs. Says something about standards in this class that there's no in person labs.

Does PNP grades affect CS grad school applications if you spend a year in industry after undergrad?
Hello! I'm considering PNP'ing CS 61c and 188.  I got half a standard deviation below average on 61c. And a full -1.5 standard deviation on 188. :((( 

The thing about 188 is that I love the projects, I love the applications. I hate the theory. I suck at it. I estimate that if I dont PNP I will get a B- or B.

As for 61c, I got half a standard deviation below average on the exam, but I'm a little higher than average in total course points. 

So what I need advice in:

\- Should I PNP 188?

\- If I PNP 188, should I just PNP 61C?

\- If I PNP both/either, graduate, take a year in industry, will grades still matter or will industry matter more for grad school applications? 

\-Do I have a better chance getting into AI research if I PNP or get the bad grade?

Dogs on campus?
Hi all! I’m a newly accepted transfer, yay :) I want to show my mom the campus, but alas, mom goes nowhere without her golden... I can’t find a clear answer online—can you bring dogs (on leash, of course) on campus? Obviously not into buildings, but just to walk around? TIA, and see you all soon! ;)

Should I P/NP this class?
I’m graduating this semester(!), and am a smidge away from graduating with honors. I’m more-or-less certain that I’m looking at an A in 3 of my classes this semester, but less certain about the 4th class, which is the only major req I’m taking this semester. So far, I have an A in the class, but it’s the only one of my classes that has a final, so the only one where it could really go either way. If I P/NP, I’ll keep my honors, and if I get below an A- in this class, I won’t graduate with honors. I’m worried that I’ll regret it if I P/NP and end up doing well, but I know that the feeling if I end up losing my honors over this will be a lot worse.

What do you guys think?

Question about roommate requests
I don’t know anyone to pick as a roommate, and I was hoping Berkeley would pick someone random for me. There isn’t an option for that in the housing application. Do I just click “save and continue” in the request roommates section of the housing application for Berkeley to pick someone random for me? Or how does that work?

TW Mental Health: I can feel it, and I need some advice.
Thank Reddit for anonymity. It has been so long since I felt depressed, but it has come upon me again.  An abusive parent is insisting on coming to the Bay to help me move and I don't know what to do, I am scared, and I am dependent upon them for rent. I'm not sure how to pull myself out of a severe depression, it seems like the medication has stopped working, and I don't want therapy. The life I have established here is slipping through my fingers like water, and I feel so very detached from my peers and my work. That feeling of calm is illusive to me now and I cannot achieve it. It feels like everything is weirdly dark. Does anyone have any advice?

When to take CS170
Hello, I'm currently a freshman planning for my course schedule for next year. I was wondering when CS/EECS students usually take CS170 since I heard CS170 helps a lot with interview prep and recruiting. Because I need to take CS61C and CS70 next year, I'm not sure if I can take CS170 in my sophomore year. Will I be at a disadvantage if I take CS170 in my junior year if I plan to recruit for SWE? Thanks in advance.

I JUST COMMITTED TO BERKELEY
I did it, no regerts 😤
--------------------------------------------------
I need some advice...😔[PLEASE READ]
So we have until tonight for P/NP, and I'm torn on whether or not I should take an ML course graded. Professor said that based on my current scores in the class, if the final group project goes well, I'm to get a B+ or better is likely. If I take the class P/NP and get all A's in my other current classes and all my summer classes, it'll raise my GPA to about a 3.53. If I take the potential B/B+ I could be shy of just a 3.5 by the end of summer, assuming I get all A's in my other current classes and all my summer classes.

I already have 4 P/NP classes on my transcript as a result of the pandemic. I'm also wondering how taking more P/NP would look applying for my MBA.

What are your thoughts?

I need advice. If I don’t go to Berkeley, I’ll be going to UC Davis. Davis feels “safer”. The thing is, I want to go to med school right after, so would Cal be better? Would I be more prepared for the stress and pressure? What if I choose cal for it’s prestige? Answer as you please. Thanks.

Outside Scholarship Contact
I’m an incoming freshman and I recently received a scholarship that will be used towards my college tuition. What department should I contact to process outside scholarships? Thank you!
--------------------------------------------------
About to be a sophomore and I still don’t feel like a Berkeley student
I don’t even feel like a college student at all. I never walked the graduation stage in high school, I never went to grad parties, I never experienced a real in-person GBO, and I’ll never know what it’s like to have a dorm experience now that I’ve been denied on-campus housing for next semester. 

I just feel so dissociated from my life, as if I’m just an observer drifting by each day. For years I looked forward to the college experience but I haven’t even had a drop of it. 

Now I’m just left here with nothing but the insane workload that Berkeley gives, zoom lectures, and a whole lot of regrets. Just thinking about how much better life could’ve been sunk me into the deepest depression of my life for a while. I really wish that I didn’t go here considering how shit their housing situation is. I could’ve gone to any of the other colleges that I was accepted into and I definitely would’ve been able to have had the bare minimum of knowing what a dorm room is like. 

On the bright side, I was really motivated to pull myself out of my depression through my creative passion. I started learning how to produce and record music and I’m proud to say that I’m going to be releasing my first single in a few weeks. Making music has been a dream of mine since I was a kid, and it feels like the only thing left that has given my life deeper meaning and happiness (which was needed, because life can feel especially meaningless in zoom lectures). 

All in all, I’m at a weird place in life right now. I was a straight-A student for all of my life until this this semester (failing 3 classes because depression and suicidal thoughts made it hard to focus), yet I’ve found true fulfillment through my music. I’m pulling myself out of this hole and I’m really grateful to still be alive and pushing forward, even if the covid situation sucks.

Maybe I don’t feel like a Bear, but at least I’m learning how to be happy again.

Will Fall 2021 Graduation be virtual?
This is probably a long shot, but I'm trying to decide whether to participate in Spring 2021 graduation or Fall 2021. Ideally, a "normal" in-person graduation would be awesome, but everything seems up in the air for Fall. Has anyone heard whether Fall 2021 graduation will be totally in-person or not?

I live in socal but they all cost pretty much the same.

Plz help me decide!!!!

SF May Remove Masks Outdoors and Reopen Bars Indoors Next Week
 San Francisco is planning to move into the yellow tier next week, a change that will be a veritable breath of fresh air for its restaurants and bars. In a small business webinar from the San Francisco Office of Economic and Workforce Development, SF Deputy Health Officer Dr. Susan Philip confirmed that the city and county are on track to enter the least restrictive yellow tier next Friday, May 7. That means that...

Does anyone know of any restaurants in Berkeley or in surrounding areas that offer their own delivery service?
Basically I am trying to find restaurants in the area that will deliver to you using their own employees. This allows me to avoid expensive UberEats fees and keeps more money the in pockets of the restaurants. I’ve only found a few that do this: West Coast Pizza on University and King Dong on Shattuck. I am sure there are others. Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------
Advice?
Incoming freshman here. Are the dorms worth the 20k? What has your experience been like, how has/will it change because of covid restrictions, and is it significantly better than a 45-60 minute commute?

Berkeley/ UCLA compared
Hey everyone 

I’m a recently admitted transfer student to both UCLA’s college of Letters and Science studying Geography/ Environmental Science and Berkeley’s college of Natural Resources studying Society and Environment. I’m looking for some advice from alum or current students about the two programs and just general differences between the programs such as workload, research opportunities/ internship within the college and community, and student life in general. Anything can honestly help. I’m just trying to make the best decision haha. Thanks!

MCB/UGBA95 class today
Hi, does anyone know if there is still a zoom lecture today?
--------------------------------------------------
Is on campus housing worth the cost as a freshman especially if you live relatively close to campus.
Is living on campus as an incoming freshman worth $20k a year? I didn't get any grants from Berkeley so I'm considering commuting from my home which is 13 miles north. It should take 15-20 minutes to get to the El Cerrito del Norte BART station and 8 minutes to downtown Berkeley Bart station, so <30 minutes in total. I don't have a licence yet, but I think one of family members can drop me off at El Cerrito del Norte.  I applied for co-op housing, but I don't know or think that I will get in for this fall term. Is the on-campus experience worth 20k?

Also a question I have is when you submit a housing portal, are you required to live there?
--------------------------------------------------
Welp. It's the last day of instruction, and I just realized I've been taking the wrong class all semester. 😐 I am not a smart man.

PLEASE Help Me Choose
Hello there, 

Sorry if this type of post has been posted here a million times but I need help choosing my undergrad college.

I got into UCSD and Berkeley and my mom didn't let me consider Berkeley since she didn't like the school, so I committed to UCSD. However, all of the sudden, she 180-d and is now telling me to consider going to Berkeley. I have one day to choose which school I want to go to.

I've always been a huge fan of UCSD, since I love the area and the school, but Berkeley is much better for my major (Molecular Cell Biology.) 

I have a couple questions about Berkeley, so please help by answering (I would GREATLY appreciate it):

&#x200B;

1: is grade deflation as bad as it is rumored to be? **how difficult is it to get a 3.5+ GPA?**

I want to go to medical school, so a respectable GPA is much needed.

&#x200B;

2: is the area around Berk good?

&#x200B;

3: how would you rate the dorms? the apartments in the area?

&#x200B;

4: do you love Berkeley? What is your favorite spot on campus?

&#x200B;

5: how difficult is it to land a spot in research opportunities and internships in the science/medical field?

&#x200B;

6: how is the social life at Berkeley? is it easy to balance social life and academics?

&#x200B;

7: is there a way I can see how easy/difficult some professors are for the classes I have to take? I am aware that ratemyprofessor exists, but it doesn't show the average grade that people receive in their class.

&#x200B;

8: what would you choose if you were in my shoes? 

I am an extroverted and academically driven student.

&#x200B;

THANK YOU SO SO SO MUCH

My friend lied about murdering his cousin and is feeling bad
My friend wrote on her college app essays about how she had this cousin who was suffering medically and couldn’t be legally euthanized so she did it herself without them knowing (pillow to the face).

Transferring from UCSD to UCB
I would like to transfer from UCSD to UCB.  I am currently an incoming freshman at UCSD. I got into UCSD as a chemical engineer in Sixth college but would like to transfer into BioE. I would like to apply as a BioE when I do my transfer apps. I would be able to transfer into BioE at the beginning of my sophomore year at UCSD so I am not sure how UCB will look at it if they see a year-long chemical engineer major make a quick switch to BioE and then apply as a BioE to Berkeley. I know that having the UC Letter of Reciprocity will help me so I am not forced to retake GEs at Berkeley if I get in. Does anyone have any advice when it comes to transferring from UCSD to UCB? Has anyone been able to successfully transfer into CoE at Berkeley? Any help passed my way would be greatly appreciated!

STAT133 w/ Gaston Sanchez
Hi all! I’m currently taking STAT133 with Sanchez and I’ve been doing *okay* this semester (scoring around average for his quizzes, did well on HWs/other assignments). I’m trying to go to grad school so I think I’ll be taking the course for a grade to avoid having too many P/NPs.

I’m really concerned about the final however because I feel like he is barely giving us any practice material (he provided just a few coding questions, nothing similar to the T/F or MC questions that he says will be on the exam). I feel very unconfident going into an exam like this with barely any practice beforehand. 

I was wondering if anyone here has any experience or tips for this class and the final in particular. Maybe someone who took this class remotely in Fall 2020? Are his questions going to be similar to the quizzes in terms of difficulty? 

Thank you in advance!

Fall '21 Heavy Workload?
Hello, 

I was wondering if this schedule was too intense for the upcoming Fall '21 semester:

1. CS 61C
2. EECS 106A
3. EECS 127
4. FILM R1B

The reason I'm taking 127 is to prepare for CS 189 in the Spring, I really want to get a good grade in it because I intend to get into robotics research. For context, I've taken 16A + 16B and enjoyed both. Should I maybe defer R1B to the Spring, or take it over the summer, before CS70's Session C?
--------------------------------------------------
Question from an incoming transfer: Declaring a Major
Hello Berkeley community! 

I have been accepted as a transfer to the college of letters and sciences, but something that caught me off guard was the absence of mentioning my major in the acceptance letter. I applied to Berkeley with a major in Classics (Ancient Greek and Roman Studies).

The letter says:

**Note: Your admission to UC Berkeley DOES NOT guarantee admission to the major of your choice. It is important that you check with the department of your intended major immediately to be certain that you are on track to declare your major.**

I'm just not sure how to go about this as a transfer haha. Is it because I need to satisfy more of the major requirements? Should I talk to an admissions counselor? How do I do that?

My acceptance to UCLA admitted me straight into the Classics major, so this is what is holding me back from committing to Cal just yet. Though I am committing to Cal, just want to be sure I get to pursue my love of greek studies! Thank you for the help.

Hi bears! I am an admitted student to L&S trying to make my decision. I really love the academics at Cal but also do want to have some fun in college because hs was pain.

Have you guys ever ask extra credit opportunity to professor?
I'm a international student and I'm not familiar with here's culture, Is it rude behavior if I ask extra credit opportunity to professor? 
In the beginning of our class, our syllabus stipulates that we have 3 midterm, but we took only one exam even it's almost end of the semester. And there's no notation for the left exam, so I think we won't take other midterm and take only a final. And our class's midterm average is near 50 out of 100, so I'm worried that we won't have a chance to make up it. So I'm thinking about asking extra credit opportunity

Courses and GPA
I’m an upcoming freshmen and will be done with all my GEs (breadths, american culture, and essential skills). I’m planning to major in computer science and with the requirement I have to take at least 13 units , would I be forced to take multiple cs courses at once ? What advice would you give in regards to course scheduling as I’ve heard taking 2 cs courses (8 units) is already more than enough

how to be better at the finish line
i feel like i do ok during the semester but i fuck up when i'm close to the finish line and my hard work during the semester goes to waste and i end up late dropping a class or taking the bad grade

any advice on how to stay strong when nearing the finish line?

2 weeks can't come fast enough
So it seems, my life is completely unraveling at the most critical point of the semester and there's absolutely nothing I can do about it except see it through. The last few days have been full of emails about move-out policies for the dorms. I also recently booked my 16-hour, 8500-mile return flight. It seems like with all this done, my mind has abruptly switched off and now only seems to be focused on getting my second dose, passing my finals, and - most importantly - being back home with my family. I have not properly studied or done homework since last week.

In the midst of all this I've ended up settling to take only one class for a letter grade. But I don't feel as though I'm out of the woods just yet. I think I'll pass my breadth class but it could have very easily been one of those "easy A" classes had I applied myself more. I'm kind of in trouble for my R1A but my GSI seeems understanding enough. And 70 is... well... it's 70.

Fortunately my grades from 61A and 61B don't leave me in a do-or-die position for 70 declaration-wise, but I am hardly doing well there and I'm getting completely overshadowed by people who had competitive math experience. I can't look at a problem and know right away what to do, and in fact half the time the solution uses some crazy math trick I never knew was possible (wtf is a triangle inequality?). Seems I don't have the M A T U R I T Y that was necessary to do well in this class. It is what it is though. I can easily still pass.

My dorm is the messiest it's ever been, I've been putting off laundry, and my body is seemingly unable to sleep normally. And now I find myself awake at 3am ahead of the last day of classes, with a boatload of work due tonight that I am yet to start. It's to the point where I consider just showing up to a zoom call an accomplishment.

Meh, the fall will be a fresh start. New apartment, in-person classes, and whatever. But can this joke of a semester please just end already?

ECON 139
For econ major / anyone who reallllyyyy wants to take Econ 139 in Fall... not sure if it will work, but let’s try...

Fucked up in a class I have an A in
I have a 93.4% in an upper division economics class, which is an A. Sadly, we have 20% of the grade that has yet to be determined. 10% for one problem set and 10% for the final.

The prof warned us in advance that the last problem set was going to be hard and long AF. 

Sadly, I didn't start it earlier because I was bogged down by job/internship interviews and depression and welp, when I started it on Monday, 7 days before the deadline, I found it was indeed hard and long AF. I went to an hour of office hours (1:1 time with the prof) and still didn't get all of my questions answered.

Looks like I'll have to take the P in this class. Sigh. I wasn't actively working towards an A in a class, but it's like I could have gotten an A if I weren't lazy and had started working on it earlier. 

I...have a GPA around 3.7 or so, and I believe that it won't affect me for jobs and stuff. Moreover, I am not planning on grad school in this field, but it's just wow, I had to fuck it up at the end when I was so close. Sigh.

I know this is far from the worst problem anyone can have, but sigh.

P/NP Econ 138
I got median for 1st midterm and about 1sd above median for 2nd midterm. The class is curved so the avg is a B+.  It's my major course and I've already taken a couple major courses P/NP, but I'm a month behind lecture (final is 40%) and I don't want to get anything below an A-. Should I P/NP or take it for a grade.

In-person graduation for Fall 2020 grads
I graduated last fall, which technically makes me class of 2020. It's very important to me that I get to attend an in-person graduation ceremony. Looking at [the commencement website](https://commencement.berkeley.edu/), it says that 1) I am eligible for the May 2021 commencement, of which only the general student procession is in person, and 2) there are plans to hold the May 2020 commencement in future at a later date, which I'm not sure I'll be eligible for. So I guess my question is if I choose to register for this year's in-person procession, would I be able to also participate in either this fall's ceremonies or whenever the class of 2020's commencement is? Also any advice on where to still get undergraduate regalia is greatly appreciated.

Thank fuck for the late grading change policy
I thought I PNP'd a class roughly a week ago, but apparently the request never got through. Imagine my absolute horror when I checked CalCentral 10 minutes after the deadline and it said the class was still being taken for a letter grade. Jesus I'm a fucking dumbfuck. Don't be like me, bears.

PSA: CHECK CALCENTRAL NOW AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S SET. YOU STILL HAVE TODAY FOR LATE GRADING OPTION CHANGES.

Data 100 Alternate Final
Hi! 

I’m a rising sophomore and wanted to take eecs16a and data 100 this fall, but they have the exact same final time. I looked through previous data100 websites and they all seemed to offer an alternate final time every year for a “documented conflict.” There’s no professor listed on the course catalog rn so can’t email the professor to clarify either. If anyone has experience with the alternative final exam, let me know if it would be possible to take both these classes together.

dont want to leave job .. advice?

I got the chance to start a really cool job in my home city since I didn’t go to campus this year (btw I’m a freshman if that changes anything advice wise haha). the job position is only open for college students and is a really great opportunity to give back. anyways, i coming to campus this fall ofc (yay) and live 2-3 hours away. i rly wanna continue this job tho. 

my boss basically sent an email out to the team today saying ill be going back to college irl and i will be missed. we didn't even have an official convo ab this. However, I take responsibility for that in she probably assumed I’d leave the position. But it’s awk since she emailed the whole team about it without still really talking with me officially.  so i emailed her back ASAP and asked to meet w her regarding the possibility of me continuing virtually and coming home on weekends (we have meetings on Saturdays usually or community events as we r opening up more). 

btw, there's three of us running this program and the third person rarely comes into the office and is able to seemingly work solely from home. kinda complicated bc she's ab to graduate (only college students are eligible to work) and is my boss' step daughter in law... so idk if my boss will let me work that way. As in, idk how she was allowed to continue working when she never came in to the office and idek what she did virtually tbh bc She never answered emails etc. i totally get why it might not be the best case for me to work while I'm 2 hours away, but i feel like i could make it work and i really put my all into my work. 

But I do know there are cons. I’m not compensate for commuting and I can not work weekdays as I have classes and 4hrs total commute a day while adjusting to irl college will be not good. do u guys think i should advocate for this? i truly truly love what this position stands for (sry i don't wanna disclose j for privacy reasons). If I had gone to a closer school I would’ve never left tbh. any thoughts on what i should bring up in our meeting tmrw? I’m so mf nervous. 😭😭😭

Choosing summer opportunities as a sophomore CS major
For the upcoming summer, I have been very fortunate to be provided with various internship and research opportunities. But I am having some difficulty in choosing one over the others and I would like to hear some opinions on what I should do. For context, I am a sophomore in CS who's interested in EE/DSP-related fields. The opportunities are:

1. working on a research project here on campus over the summer with a nice stipend.
2. internship at a pretty widely known company working in EE/DSP-related field. 
3. internship at a startup in a very DSP-heavy field.

For context, I haven't really made up my mind on what I want to do after I graduate (industry or Masters / Ph.D.) so all of these choices are wonderful in their own regard (1 gives me great opportunities and leverage for grad school; 2 and 3 give me great opportunities to connect and to give me some leverage on applying to jobs after graduation). Out of choice 2 or 3, I am leaning more towards 3 just because the work environment is something I feel like I can see myself working in the future as opposed to 2 feels a little bit more corporate-y (if that's even a descriptor) but widely known company = more pay and more connections (?). I would like some insight on people who had similar dilemmas in choosing these opportunities and your experiences if possible. Thank you so much in advance!

Is this a viable CS schedule?
**Fall 2021 (Semester 3)**

* CS 70
* CS 61C
* 2 Breadths

**Spring 2022 (Semester 4)**

* CS 170
* EECS 16B
* 1 Breadths (final breadth)

A couple of concerns I have:

1. Would the combined workload of 70/61C be too high? And similarly for 170/16B?
2. Would I be unable to reliably enroll in 170 Sp22 if I'm only declaring in F21? If so, what would be my best alternative? I'm considering the following, but it feels kinda awkward:

* F21: 70, 3 Breadths
* Sp22: 61C, 16B, \[?\]
* F22: 170, \[UpperDiv\], \[?\]

Cons of being a spring transfer admit
Hi! I just got admitted as a spring 2022 transfer and am having a hard time deciding whether going to Berkeley would be a good choice. Could any other spring admits share their experience in terms of graduating on time, being able to register for classes you need for your major, how many summer classes might be necessary to take if you do want to graduate in 1.5 years still, etc?

Prospective Econ Major (P/NP)
Hello,

I am a second-year student intending econ. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I decided to P/NP all my classes. I am currently taking an econ elective (econ 115), I was wondering if I could P/NP this class as an undeclared major. The FAQ page only provides information on P/NP upper divs for declared econ majors. I was wondering how this will affect me since I am undeclared and if I do P/NP, will this count towards the 5 upper div electives I have to do when I am declared.

Thanks!

But given my track record with school, I don't think I could handle it anyways, but I was curious as to other people's experiences. Cheers!

Rejected with 4.0 as a CC History Transfer
Hi,

I was rejected from Berkeley (& UCLA smh..) with a 4.0 at my CC where I took every prerequisite, challenging Chinese courses, and more. I had multiple A+s and nothing belong an A. I had professors even offer to write me letters of recommendation without me asking that would say my work is at a graduate level. I couldn't include those because neither school will let you submit them for transfer but maybe for an appeal?

Has anyone else had this happen? I don't understand why this happened when the process is so algorithmic due to application numbers. I am also an extremely low income student who has been working for years to afford school. I will likely try to appeal but am just not sure what they were looking for if I didn't make it. I can update them on more details of issues I overcame (and the reason why I couldn't do TAP - school counselors ignored me all fall due to amount of students in need & limited staff during Covid). I completed IGETC. 

Congratulations to everyone who did get in! I am extremely disappointed as I have worked tirelessly for years only to be struck down for no apparent (to me) reason. I am appreciative of the opportunity to try and successfully appeal but it is hard to know how when the admissions offices can't talk to you about your individual application.

Any advice would be appreciated! Would also love to know if anyone else is in the same boat. I am seeing lots of people who were accepted with much lower stats, where are my fellow 4.0 rejects at?

EECS Transfer course load question
Hey everyone! Just got accepted last week as a Junior transfer into EECS at Berkeley and cannot be more excited since this has been my dream school for a long time. Just had a quick question about course load and would be super appreciative if anyone could give me any perspective/advice. Below is the sample schedule that Berkeley gives for graduating in 2.5 years as an EECS transfer, how reasonable/ridiculous is this? To me it looks doable, EXCEPT the second semester which seems like it might be a bit much. I've done pretty well throughout my time at CC and am prepared to work as hard as I possibly can, but obviously the level of academic rigor and workload at Berkeley wont be anything close to what I've experienced anywhere else before. If anyone has any words of wisdom it would be greatly appreciated, I'm just trying to set myself up for success the most I possibly can, thanks!

3rd year looking for a roommate (or two or three), to split an apartment
Hi!

I'm looking for roommates to split an apartment with. I'm a chemical biology major and I'm minoring in CS. This will be my third year (I'm 20). I'm a big fan of chemistry, especially medicinal chemistry and pharmacology. Alexander Shulgin's books are like the Bible to me and Hamilton Morris is my prophet. I've also been doing CS since I was 10 basically. Favorite langauge is Rust, and I hate Python. I'm also a bit of a musician and I listen to music a lot. I like all sorts of music, but lately I've been a fan of Australian psychedelic rock and also have been listening to a lot of Radiohead. I play the drums (but obviously won't bring my drum kit), and I've been learning a bit of piano and guitar, and I also do a bit of electronic stuff with various analog synths etc. Oh, I also buy, repair, and collect tape machines.

I do have pet rats, two girls, and I'm not sure I'm ready to give them away. They don't smell or anything, nor are they noisy, but I know some people are grossed out by rats, so I thought I'd mention it. Also I don't care if you have pets either, in fact I friggen love dogs and if you have a dog that would actually be a bonus for me lol. Cats are okay too if we're in separate bedrooms (so they can't get in and merc my rats).

I'd prefer to split a 2/3/4 br apartment rather than live in a double, but I can do a double too so long as there's enough space in the bedroom for my equipment. I don't think I'll bring much of my chemistry equipment, but I would like to bring some of my instruments and of course my electronics.

To split a multi-bedroom apartment my budget is around $1200-1600ish, so something in the range of 2.4-3.2k for a 2 BR apartment would be nice. Although I've seen 3br and 4br apartments for not much more so it would be nice to do that and save even more. I don't mind too much living slightly farther from campus for a better deal as I think I'm planning on bringing my car this time around.

If anybody is interested please DM me or comment. If multiple people are interested, even better, and if possible several of us could split a bigger apt for fat savings.

**Edit:** oh also I'm a male. I don't mind male/female/anything else if we're in separate bedrooms, but I think I'd prefer male if you're looking to double.

Also I don't really ever throw parties, but I don't mind them either. I drink, I don't smoke weed or cigarettes anymore (but I don't mind if you do), but I do still vape. I *do* do... other drugs... as well, but it's not like you're going to walk in on 10 grams of amphetamine on the living room table lol.

Thanks!

Data 8 or Math 53
Which is more useful in the long-run and for other classes? I’m an intended cs major. I’ve taken cs61a, cs61b, and eecs16a, and I plan to take cs70 in the summer and eecs16b in the fall. In fall, ill also be taking my r1b and an easy breadth. 

Not sure if I should take data8 or math53, and I’m not too sure what career path I want to go down either. My last math class was ap calc bc junior year, so im prob really rusty. I bet data8 will be “easier”, but math53 may be more useful idk?

Any advice is appreciated :)
--------------------------------------------------
CS61B + CS70 vs. CS70 + EE16B difficulty
Is it more difficult to take CS61B + CS70 together in the fall or CS70 + EE16B together in the spring? Keep in mind I'll be taking CS70 having taken only Math 1B (got an A) and no higher math course and without having taken EE16A .

If I take CS61B + EE16A in the fall then I would take CS70 + EE16B in the spring.

If I take CS61B + CS70 in the fall then I would take CS61C + EE16A in the spring.
--------------------------------------------------
UGBA 88
What are the grade bins for this class like? Everyone I know hasn't been doing well this semester so what is the cutoff for an A, A-, and B+?
--------------------------------------------------
Thoughts on CS 70 this summer as a pre-frosh?
I'm a pre-frosh intending to major in L&S CS. I've finished all of the breadths and GE requirements so I'm considering a technical class this summer.

I have community college math experience, having taken Multi, Diff eqs, Lin alg, and discrete.

I have heard that competition math is helpful for CS 70, however, the most I have is barely making the AIME floor on the AMC 12 this year. Would that count as comp math experience or would I need more?

Is taking CS 70 advisable? Any advice/thoughts would be helpful :)
--------------------------------------------------
61B, 16B, Data 8
Would these three classes, along with an easy breadth, be doable? For reference, I'm taking 61A now, and am pretty comfortable with it, and I'm pnping 16A cuz I don't want to deal with it. Also, should I take 16B with Sahai or Ranade?
--------------------------------------------------
Math53 Canic Syllabus/ Website. Or how do discussions work
I want to take Math53, and it says that there is in-person discussion MWF. I’m just wondering is discussion attendance is required and why there is so much dedicated time to discussion every week. Reading canic’s syllabus would be helpful thanks :)
--------------------------------------------------
Taking two lab classes? (Chem 3B lab)
Up to this point, I've only taken one lab class per semester. I'm starting my upper divisions and I was planning to take Chem 3B lab with an upper division biology class (ESPM 132-Spider Biology).

I'm just a bit concerned because I heard taking bio1a lab and chem 1a/3a/3b lab together is hard.

Does this sound like a horrible idea? Should I take pbhlth 162A(Public Health Microbiology) instead?
--------------------------------------------------
How many P/NP for major class is ok?
So far have 3 major classes as P/NP. Thinking of taking P/NP for another one. Is it worth it?

Can I get an associates degree from a community college after enrolling in Berkeley?
Incoming freshmen here

So, I know I’m not allowed to enroll any courses outside of Berkeley when I’m taking classes there during non-summer terms, and that I would need to get approval if I wanted to take classes at let’s say a community college. 

Basically I won’t need to take any courses at my local CC to receive an AS degree in the fall, since I would have all the requirements to receive it completed through dual enrollment courses and AP tests. I wanted to get my degree in the summer but I just found out that I need my AP credits at the time I petition for my degree, and I won’t have all of them until scores are released in July this year. 

So, do you think I’d be allowed to petition in the fall for it? Otherwise I don’t really want to take my AP exams besides ones that satisfy major prereqs cause I already have a lot of units that will be transferred to Berkeley. I know I should probably ask administration at Berkeley or something but I have no clue who to contact.

Waitlist Position for Lab Section
Is it possible to see the position I am on the waitlist for the lab section because right now I can only seem to see my waitlist position for the associated lecture.

Workload of cs classes
Picking classes rn. Need to take 2 techs. Cs162, 170, 188, data 100 are my options rn. I want an easier schedule and I've always done the best with coding but terrible on problem set classes. What should I take (rip 168)
--------------------------------------------------
Econ 100A prep
Taking Econ 100A during the summer  and I’ve heard there’s some calc involved....the last time I took calc was over three years ago and I pretty much forgot everything. Feeling pretty anxious so I was wondering if there are any material(s) I can get to prep for the class ahead of time? Like textbooks or worksheets.
--------------------------------------------------
How hard is EECS 126?
I saw on piazza and reddit lots of conflicting things about 126, such as its easier than 170, it was the hardest class at Berkeley, and also some saying it's easier than 70. I did decently well in 170, but thought 70 was quite hard when I took it (although I feel it may be due to my lack of \~mathematical maturity\~). Also, would taking 126 with CS 162 and EECS 16B be overkill? I think I am strong at projects and finished every project for 61B/61C/186 in < 10 hours, and also did decently well in 16A. Thanks!

Berkeley L&S or NYU CAS?
Hey everyone!

I’m currently deciding between UC Berkeley L&S and NYU CAS as an OOS for both (from NJ). I've posted this on other subreddits but wanted to get any input here too especially since it's so close to decision day. I’ve ranked my pros and cons below from 1-5, with 5 being very important and 1 being not important.

Intended Major: Undecided but leaning towards STEM (especially math/physics) or econ/pre-law.

**UC Berkeley L&S** (around 63K/year - OOS tuition)

Pros:

* Very strong in stem but solid all-around, probably the most well-rounded choice (5)
* Best name and International reputation (5)
* Though class sizes are large, discussion sections are smaller (15-30 people from what I’ve heard) (4)
* Located in the Bay Area, hub for STEM (especially tech but not really interested in tech atm) (4)
* Appears to have the best grad school outlook out of my options (4)
* Good research opportunities (though I’ve heard differing things about this) (4)
* Distance and new environment could be a good opportunity to grow if I end up enjoying living in Berkeley (4)
* Great off campus food (3)
* Very nice campus (3)
* Nice weather (2)
* Very diverse (1)

Cons:

* Very far away (>2500 miles) and just unfamiliar with living in the Bay Area overall (though on the flip side, this could be a good experience if I like it) (5)
* Very high student:faculty ratio (19:1) and class sizes (5)
* I’ve heard office hours can get congested with too many people, and it can turn into another mini-lecture (5)
* Pretty expensive (both the university and living in the Bay Area) (4)
* Very competitive (could be a pro) (4)
* Alumni network is heavily concentrated in CA, which might make it harder to find jobs on the East Coast (I’d like to keep my doors open to working in NYC or in the east) (3)
* Concern that professors will be too focused on their research and grad students (3)
* Housing/dorm/bathroom situation not great (though manageable if costs are split) (3)
* Grade deflation (though I’ve heard that grad schools take this into account) (3)
* Very unsafe (3)
* Clubs can be competitive (2)
* On campus food is meh (2)

**NYU CAS** (around 52K/year)

Pros:

* Strong math program (Courant) and strong business/econ/finances/social sciences (5)
* Lower student:faculty ratio (9:1) and smaller class sizes than Berkeley (5)
* Located in NYC, hub for banking/finances/etc, lack of campus puts me right in the city (5)
* Alumni network may make it easier to find a job on east coast (5)
* Closer to home and familiar with NYC which can provide a sense of familiarity/safety net if things go wrong (4)
* Competitiveness is lower because no curve in CAS (3)
* Cheaper than Berkeley (3)
* Average GPA is higher which could help with grad school (3)
* Housing guaranteed for four years, and is probably the best out of all my options (though 56% of students live off campus) (3)
* Has private school resources that Berkeley won’t have (2)
* Safer (2)
* Nice on campus food I think (2)
* Diverse (1)

Cons:

* Not as well-rounded as Berkeley, I don’t really think NYU’s STEM overall is nearly as strong as Berkeley’s (5)
* Good name but not as strong as Berkeley’s, international reputation is much weaker (4)
* Class sizes are still large (4)
* NYC living costs are expensive - I’ve also heard that NYU makes students undergo a variety of expenses in other ways (like meal plans, etc.) and their financial aid office is unhelpful (4)
* May not be too challenging (4)
* Lack of campus and less school spirit/school activities makes social life and having friends harder (though I would probably be fine) (3)
* Not as nice weather as Berkeley (this isn’t really a big deal tbh) (2)

I've visited both campuses and liked them.

Overall, I would view Berkeley as the more risky option since I don’t know how I’ll like the environment, but I could also really like it and could help me grow a lot as a person provided that I do (not that NYU won't but Berkeley might be more of a new experience). I've also heard that a path back to the East Coast could be hard, though others have told me that it's definitely possible (just most Berkeley grads are from CA originally and don't really want to go to the east anyway), so not rlly sure about that. NYU is closer to home and more familiar, but I might not be out of my comfort zone as much due to my location and stuff like that. Would really appreciate any help - thank you so much! (And sorry this is so long lol)
--------------------------------------------------
Reserved Seating for Classes
Does anyone know how to get reserved seating for Berkeley classes? There are a couple of design innovation classes I've been trying to get for a couple of semesters but my registration time is always shit. One of the classes I want to take says it has open reserved seating for sophomores but how can I get one of those seats? Do I have to contact the proffessor?
--------------------------------------------------
Chef Elmy at it again !

--------------------------------------------------
Is it still possible to get CS170? Why did the waitlist fill up so quickly?
I'm declaring at the end of the semester but because of how late my enrollment time was I couldn't even waitlist myself for 170. Is it still possible to get this class after I declare and is CS170 enrollment normally like this? I was really banking on getting on the waitlist so that I could register during phase 2.
--------------------------------------------------
Cs 170 waitlist?
Hi guys, i wanted to know my chances of getting off the 170 waitlist if I’m in position 367 :( I’m taking 70 in the summer and will be able to declare at the end of summer (hopefully lol). Will  I be jumped up in the waitlist when I declare and do I have any chance of getting in? Should I instead join the 16b waitlist then? Thank you so much
--------------------------------------------------
Will I get in to EECS 16B?
Current freshman here. I just had my Phase 1 and I'm #307 on the 16B waitlist. Is there any chance I'll get in? How big do you think 16B will be for Fall '21? My declaration forms will probably be processed sometime in the early summer, so is there any chance I can get in as a declared sophomore?
--------------------------------------------------
Summer Courses
I only have to fulfill a couple of requirements left for my GEs which are English R1B, the foreign language requirement, international studies, and philosophy and values. I recently found that I also need to take an American Cultures course. Is it possible to take a course that fulfills both the American Cultures course and one of the other requirements I listed above or can a course only fulfill one of them. If they can fulfill both, which UC Berkeley courses would you recommend so I know to try and fulfill other requirements at a community college this summer.
--------------------------------------------------
Any Interesting DeCal courses to take?

--------------------------------------------------
Wow... Check this out... Flip The Coin

--------------------------------------------------
Phase 1 or Phase 2 for Math 1b?
Would I be able to get math 1b for phase 2? Or should I not risk the chance and just phase 1 math1b?

Asking because I want to enroll for another breadth class that fills up pretty quick, but I must take math1b next semester regardless.
--------------------------------------------------
ESPM50AC waitlist question
Does anyone know if L&S rising sophomores are automatically waitlisted for this class (I’m an l&s rising sophomore) because there are still open seats but I got placed on the waitlist :/
Any so, if I’m #70 on the waitlist would i have a good chance at still getting in?
Any help is appreciated!

Sophomore Fall 2021 Schedule Advice
Hi, I was wondering if anyone had any advice for class scheduling for Fall 2021. It will be my first semester at campus and I'm unsure of whether it would be advisable to schedule back to back classes (online to in person) considering I haven't yet found off-campus housing to live. I'm also not sure if its ideal to have a 3 hour period between my statistics lab and science lab that are all on campus, but I think that's unavoidable. Any help or just thoughts about it would be appreciated! Thank you! (The 3 schedules below are the ones I am considering.)

How is the Chem 3AL final like?
Hey guys,
For those that have taken Chem 3AL in the past, how did you study for the final? What worked and what didn't work? How difficult is the final?
--------------------------------------------------
What is it like living in Bowles Hall?
Like, is it good for kids who need to study? Is it all parties and events? Multiple posts have said it is like a family which I would love (though some say its a cult), but I would like to know if I would still be able to spend my time studying, preferably with other CS majors. I like to think of myself as pretty social, but because I'm L&S CS, I really need to study my first year.
--------------------------------------------------
CS 184 / 161 workload
Just trying to plan ahead, I have seen people say 184 is heavy and mixed things about 161's workload. I am not sure if 161 is offered in Spring 2022 since it isn't on the draft but sometimes that changes. If it is offered, does this seem like too much? If it is, what is recommended to go along with 184? (I've taken 170, 188, 186)
--------------------------------------------------
DSP on campus?
Incoming transfer with pretty gnarly ADHD. I’m really curious to hear from any other neurodivergent students and their experience at Cal. Particularly, in regards to DSP and accommodations.

Thanks a bunch 🤗💛
--------------------------------------------------
PNP R4A?
This may be a dumb question, but am I allowed to take my r4a class P/NP? It allowed me on cal central but I'm reading the spring P/NP policy and it says I can't take an r1a class P/NP.

applying to Public Health spring semester: wtf do you enroll in for Fall semester??
I am attending advising appointments religiously and getting all my questions answered, but it still seems so confusing and unclear??? anyone applying to Public Health this spring and confused about what to enroll in for fall? I was told to enroll in upper div public health classes that don’t require declaration, but the list is literally so limited lol. maybe I’m doing it all wrong idk. 

anyone in same boat?

Is CS61b, Data100, EECS16a+breadth a reasonable schedule?
The breadth is generally considered “easy” and idk if this helps but I’ve also taken Math54 so the linear algebra portion of 16a shouldn’t be too big of an issue I think. This is the most number of units I’ve taken so far so any advice would be much appreciated!
--------------------------------------------------
Priority Registration
Is there any way to get priority registration besides from just being like a Reagents Scholar or like an athlete??

econ major: data c8
im super confused bc i’m hearing different things, but does data c8 still fulfill the stats req for econ majors? if not, which stats class would u recommend?
--------------------------------------------------
Alternate final exam time
If I am in a different time-zone and have to take a final exam (for a cs course like cs70 or cs61b) at an alternate time, would I be taking the exact same final everyone takes or do they make a separate final for students? I'm taking a final at a different time and don't want a harder exam by any chance :(
--------------------------------------------------
Math 53 Grade
Hello! My grade in Math 53 with Professor Stankova is currently at the class average, and my grade on midterms has been fairly consistent. If I am also able to get an "average" score on the final, what final grade will I be likely to get?   


If I am not likely to get a B+, I will take the course P/NP. Thanks for your help!
--------------------------------------------------
URGENT!!! need advice (transfer)
hi again for 1000x time

so i have done all my igetc/major prereqs. but due to timing and not getting unit overrides, it looks like i am gonna need a summer session to do 5 units to meet the 60mim.

berk has a form you can fill out requesting this, has anyone does this before and can give me advice? i do not want to ask for a summer session then be rescinded lol
--------------------------------------------------
Has anyone here taken MUSIC 29 (Music Now) or MUSIC 25 (Intro to Music Theory)?
Thinking of taking one of these over the summer.

For Music 29:
- If you took it over Zoom, how did that work? What were the "labs" like?
- How was the workload in general?

For Music 25:
- Did it involve any sight-singing?
- Did you have to take a diagnostic test?
--------------------------------------------------
Music25?
I was going to take music25 for my arts and literature breadth and was wondering if anyone on here had taken it and could comment on how the course is? Thank you!

Edit: also how likely is it that I get off the waitlisted anyone knows I’m number 4 and the class size is 25
--------------------------------------------------
Should I Pnp EECS 16A?
Title. I’m definitely overthinking this but I would love some advice. Intended CS and I’m on track to get exactly a B, no more no less. I think taking it pnp would give me more time to work on other classes, plus protect my gpa. Still I’m concerned if having a pnp graduation requirement is a bad look. 

Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------
Anyone attend the Cal Week “On-Campus Housing Overview for Transfer Students” Lecture?
The lecture was titled “Your Home at UC Berkeley: On-Campus Housing Overview for Transfer Students”, April 29th at 1:00-2:00 (still currently going on!)

Unfortunately, I didn’t know you had to register in advance and planned on just joining the zoom lecture at 1, so i wasn’t allowed entry. 

I really really needed to hear this one, did anyone watch it and have any notes or summaries of what was said? 

As a first year transfer student I have absolutely no idea how any of the housing process works, so any basic explanations or information would be extremely helpful!

Recs for Arts+ Lit breadth classes and international studies breadth classes

Taking 3 CS tech courses
I'm a transfer student and I'm thinking of taking 61C, 70, and 161 this next fall semester. Is this doable or will I fail? I heard 61C has a high workload.

Just making sure but we can only choose 3 4 unit classes for phase 1 and select the other 4 unit during phase 2 correct

--------------------------------------------------
Here is a moral dilemma for you
A friend of mine exaggerated a lot on their app and got into cal, which is their dream school. I mean dates, hours, and a few details here and there. They did not make anything up out of the blue. This person has felt extremely guilty for the past 4 months and has tried to make amends and go back and fix things, but only successfully fixed some. This person is not the type of person to cheat/lie/etc, but they had a lapse of judgement that made them act this way at the moment. I've seen them grow from this experience and better themselves. Now the question is: should this person attend cal or go somewhere else?
--------------------------------------------------
phase 2 stat 88?
thoughts
--------------------------------------------------
does cs61b expand?
it says there's 830 seats right now. i'm paranoid i won't get in if i phase 2 it. does it usually expand to 1000 people or should i phase 1 it. i'm undeclared l&s
--------------------------------------------------
Wait so CS majors who are abt to declare are just fucked for a semester?
Just wrapping up 61b and 70 this sem, so I can’t declare until the end of the semester. I also apparently can’t enroll in any upper divs for fall, even tho I’ll be declared by the time I’d actually be taking them(I think? Idk how long it takes them to process it, but it’s just a calculation, right?) I was hoping to take 188/170, but apparently I can’t. I dropped the 170 idea and subbed in 61c, and I’m spot 300something on the 188 waitlist. Does anyone have any advice for me/people in this situation? This seems like a routine problem, where people just have their hands tied for a semester/can’t effectively continue their education. 

Guess I’ll take like 3 breadth classes?
--------------------------------------------------
Why Are Most Club Members Sophomores?
I can't help but notice that in all of my clubs, no matter what kind they are (competition team, volunteering, identity) most of the club's active members are 2nd years. Not just general members but leadership positions. As a sophomore myself I have no issue with this but I'm wondering if anyone has noticed the same thing. 

Why is this the case? Do older students gain less from clubs? Are they too busy with research or classes? Or does club participation eventually burn you out?

L&S Late Schedule Change Request
This semester has been really hard for me and I'm not doing very well in one of my classes. It's a major requirement so I don't want to take it pass/no pass. If  I were to drop this class using the L&S Late Schedule Change form I would be at 10 units. Would this impact my financial aid status or my status as a full-time student since L&S requires 13 units?

Taking CS70 and Math 53
I'm planning out my schedule for Fall 2021 and I wondering if it's alright to take CS70 and Math 53 together. I am intended CS rising sophomore but I want to keep statistics as a backup option, which is why I'm taking Math 53. In addition to these two classes, I'll be taking a breadth and a 1 unit class to reach 13 units. 

Also, since I'll be a sophomore next year there's no harm in putting off EECS16B until Spring 2022 right?

Thank you!

Anyone have experience with Brian Salazar?

How useful are Professor Parekh's lectures for the CS 70 Final?
Currently, I've been going through each of the notes by hand, and will be reviewing each of the discussion assignments soon too. When going to live lectures, I found myself just getting lost in his presentation, so I haven't really learned through them. Should I go through all his recorded lectures or are there better places where I can learn the fundamentals behind the concepts. In hindsight, I really wish I would have spent extra time understanding his live lectures back then since I would be better prepared now, but with two weeks left, does anyone have any advice/resources that helped a lot? I don't really like that the class is graded depending on how well others do since I have no idea how well I need to prepare relative to how others are doing.
--------------------------------------------------
Enrollment Questions
1. Is Prof. Presti not teaching Drugs and the Brain this fall semester? I couldn't find the class in the enrollment center... :(
2. Is there a way to get into Art 12: Drawing Foundations without being an art major? It's such a small class and I just wanted a lighter load to offset as well as meet the Art breadth.
3. Has anyone taken NUSCTX 108A? Is it hard? Should I take NUSCTX 10 first? I want to explore more classes this fall.
4. Any history breadth class recommendations?
5. Does anyone know how CS61A formatted their discussion sections? Cause in enrollment there are no choices right now...

Thanks guys!

fall 170 enrollment but wont be declared till end of summer
hi!! so im (hopefully) going to be declared cs after i finish 70 this summer. i wanna take 170 in the fall, but pretty sure i wont have priority since ill be technically undeclared. is it worth phase 1ing 170 in my case or to even go for it at all? any advice would be super helpful!!!
--------------------------------------------------
I need some P/NP advice
Right now in CS 70, I am doing fairly okay with a MT score of +0.1 or +0.2. From previous posts, I know this falls around a B range. So, I am curious about whether I should P/NP considering I do have plans for grad school later and my GPA is still fairly high right now. It would be great if someone could list some  advantages or drawbacks of taking it as P/NP because I am super conflicted about what to do. Thanks in advance for any input.

Also, just so that I can dream, what would I need on the final to boost my grade to an A or A-.
--------------------------------------------------
CS61A and CogSci 1 Time Conflict
I was enrolling for classes for fall today and found out that cogsci 1 and 61a have the same final time slot. Since 61a is allowing time conflicts, is it likely that they'll also be offering alternate exam times?

Not sure if I should switch cogsci 1 with another class. I'm currently 41 on the waitlist. Thanks for the advice in advance!

No one wants to be my roommate
I’m currently a HS senior and committed to Berkeley. Originally I was going to dorm with a close friend who is also going to Cal with me, but I told her about my plans for requesting a gap year and she wanted someone to dorm with this fall. And then I started talking to this other girl, who was a great match for me because we had a lot in common, but ended up saying no because I told her about the gap year. The thing is, I’m Requesting a gap year, it doesn’t mean I’m guaranteed to have it. It’s kind of sad but I hope I can request them again later in the future(idk if we can do that). It just makes me feel sad because in the case if I don’t get my gap year approval i would have to dorm with someone random for a whole year...

Econ 100b VS Econ 101b grades
Hey! SOS trying to quickly decide which one to take before my enrolment

between 100b and econ 101b which one is it easier to get a better grade in? For reference (if this helps) I got an A+ in Math 1B? but idk how well that prepares me for econ 101b

&#x200B;

 I've heard the curve for 101b is more lenient but judging by Berkeleytime it seems as if more people are getting in the A range for 100b? so im really conflicted 

hahahh any help would be appreciated, thanks!!

Should I apply for a theme?
I'm an incoming freshman who'll be living on campus, and I've been thinking of applying to AATP or GETH. I'm thinking about it cause I want to have networking opportunities, so I'm wondering whether students have actually benefitted from these themes as far as networking and getting close to your professors. 

As far as AATP goes, I'm not black but I was born in North Africa, so I'm not sure if it would be the best fit for me if the focus is more towards the black community. 

So with my priority being networking, should I join a theme program? If so, is GETH or AATP more advantageous?

CS 61bl or CS b advice
should I take cs61bl in the summer or cs61b in the fall. I heard that the main difference is that cs61bL is had more weightage in the labs, so if you don't really test well (me), it's probably better. However, its only available in the summer so the class would be extremely rushed. Which one is overall better? Also is it doable to do data 100, cs 61bl, and physics 8A in the summer? Or is that way too much work for those 3 months? Thankssss

Taboo to take cc classes?
Hopefully future data science major here. I’m taking cs61a and math 1B at cc this summer and math 54(and Likely cs61b) in fall also at cc. So basically I’m only taking data8 at cal for a grade. This is all technically allowed but is it not “good” to take all lower divs at cc when already admitted into cal? Should I take 61b at cal instead? Any advice would be vvv appreciated cause my registration app is tomorrow!! Thank you

should I pnp a bio pre req for med/grad school
For my chem & physiology courses, I am taking the class for a grade because my grade is guaranteed. I either can drop the final , replace the final with a project, or have some sort of accommodations. The projects are due before finals week. For my bio class, I am worried that I am not going to do well on the final. I had 3-4 days of fevers and headaches after my first covid shot. My next one is scheduled the a 2 days before my exam. The side effects are unpredictable but I am worried that I will be getting a fever and headaches for a few days. This would obviously hinder my ability to do well on final that’s worth half my grade. Med schools/grad schools would understand this right?

Should I start in Math 53?
HS Senior here, coming to Cal this fall. I'm torn between starting in Math 1B or 53. On the one hand, 1B is supposed to be a suicidally hard weeder class. On the other hand, it covers some differential equations content that we aren't really learning in Calc BC. So, should I start in 1B just for differential equations or should I start in 53 and just do the diff eq stuff in math 54? Any advice is appreciated, thanks!

(I am expecting to get a 4-5 on the BC test. And, if it matters, I'm doing engineering.)

16B Troubles
I took 16A last semester and, to be honest, I have no clue how I passed. I learned very little in 16A, very basic linear algebra, and very basic circuits. I took 16B this semester and my lack of 16A knowledge caught up with me real quick which, compounded with an inability to handle online school has made my experience in 16B very rough. Last semester, I was able to get by with 100% of HWs and labs and very poor midterm/final schools. This semester... I haven't been able to get at least 30% of the lab points even with the 80% curve nor full points on the HW and my midterm was still bad.

This brings my question, I'm an EECS major but to be honest, EECS16A/B has really put me off of EE while CS61A/B have made me fall in love with CS. If I'm able to eek out a P for 16B while still not knowing much of the content (so basically trying to cram enough to do decently on the final (60+% or so), should I do so, or will not knowing 16A or 16B concepts snowball into an even larger problem down the line? Should I take the NP, try and teach myself 16A content over the summer to retake 16B in the fall? Thanks for any advice.

Edit: I have no post-graduate intentions.

Homeless/disturbed guy ID
I don’t need his name or full name or anything and have no actual complaint but I was in Berkeley in Jan. and there was an either homeless and or disturbed man who was young, younger than me probably early twenties. 

What made him unique was he had a massive giant rug or blanket he was carrying, but it was actually massive as if he could have slapped people with it. Almost felt like a weird movie scene. 

He was screaming angrily and loudly and said something about electrical this, something that. It almost sounded intelligent but in an obviously messed up and mentally ill way. I wouldn’t be surprised if he was an ex UC Berkeley student. He did seem like a guy on drugs and while I’m sure they exist how many Cal students would do meth? Even after their schooling. 

Just curious of who he is, his story. Maybe he was a passerby on a bus. I even talked with a downtown employee guy who works with homeless and sick people and said he even admitted he was unique for his age and “intellectual” rants although it was a word salad, just sounded like he had something analytical to think of it but it was construed. 

He was bearded, kinda curly hair. He obviously was disturbed, and of course not someone you’d want to be around during his rants, but I know what it’s like to feel pissed off and scream but we know he’s not all right. He must have been triggered and probably even a bad day for a guy who lives like that. 

We don’t know if he was a student or not but it tells you even the brightest and hardest working can end up like this.

Help!【Summer Session】 Is this summer schedule doable for a freshman?
Hey, everyone, please give me some advice🙏🙏

I am a 2025er and I just enrolled two courses in this summer session. I planned to take **COLWRIT R1A** (by prof **Joe De Quattro** \- heard that he was amazing and the average GPA was high) and **MATH W54** by Nadler.

Is this **workload** too heavy for a freshman? What are my chances if I wanna get an **A** for CW R1A and at least a B+ for MATH W54? Note that I am an international student (English not my native language), and even though Joe De Quattro's R1A is said to be easy A by most students, I still worry that my situation might different...

hi guys. im just super stressed right now and i really don’t know where to rant so i’m just gonna rant here. so im in a long distance relationship and we have never met eachother until this summer…we are planning to meet eachother and he’s gonna come fly across the country to see me at berkeley tho because none of our parents can know (mostly mine because they are super strict) but im kind of in a dilemma. so first he wants to come in august and i was like okay ill try to dorm early or whenever the dorming date is and we’re gonna get an airbnb close by and everything but the dates weren’t working out and now the plan is he wants to come during july and ill be taking summer online classes at berkeley but im trying to dorm there tho during july so i can have an excuse to be there you know but since they are virtual classes i dont even know my chances of getting a dorm and with everything going on with covid. and the thing is he booked everything it has free cancellations so its alright but i dont want to be a party pooper and be like “oh i cant dorm” he was saying i could make something up but i literally cant 😭 and like i rather have him come during school or late august/early september but he said im gonna have classes and i told him it wont take the whole day. and he also plans to stay with me in my dorm (my roommate knows him but i haven’t told her yet bc it makes me feel weird for asking) and i dont even know if that’s possible and just ugh😭😭 im just stressed bc i got ap exams to study for and he has to book everything before his flight especially to get discounts but for me i dont wanna rush right after graduation and leave to berkeley. its my last summer in a way with my family before im a college student and i wanted to enjoy it and dont get me wrong i would love to be with him. we’ve been together for 1 1/2 yrs now and its super healthy and amazing nothings wrong, i just dont know what to do now. he also saved up half the year for both of us and he made $2k. its like i want everything to work right but i cant tell him “yeah bby everythings gonna work out” when i dont even know the official date to move in or summer or anything 😭😭 ahhh i honestly am down to do the september thing but i dont know how long classes are ugh. thanks for reading if you made it this far🥺🤧

Late drop EECS16B?

How hard are classes at Berkeley?
Hello, I got accepted as a transfer student for Data Science and I just want to know how much harder the classes will get. I've taken Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra already and passed with B's, but I am afraid that a B in community college means that I will struggle a lot since the curriculum is more rigorous.   


I just want to know the gap between Berkeley and community college so I do not get overwhelmed by the difficulty if I choose to accept their offer.  


If it helps I would be taking classes such as Data C8 and Comsci 6A/B.

Can I cram math 55 into 1 week?
Hey guys...

So basically I'm still enrolled in math 55 but I stopped watching lecture after week 1. I've also missed both midterms and have only ever done one homework assignment (worth 15%) for the course. Here is the thing though, course policy is that missed midterms (worth 20% each) will be replaced by the final exam (worth 45%) and so if I'm not mistaken I could score up to 85% just taking the final. I'd like to get the class out of my way but since they haven't released a grade distribution I'm a bit hesitant. I'm considering 

a) dropping the class:
Less stress short-term, can focus better on other classes, but (likely) will have to take it again in the future, which means more stress then

b) p/np the class:
Medium amount of stress short-term, don't have to retake it in the future but it means I'll have a p on my record which might look bad especially if I could get a decent letter grade

c) go all out
High stress short-term, but I could wind up walking away with a decent grade if I do well. Also could probably still pass if I don't??



Any math 55 students, if you could give me some advice that would be great! Do I cram the entire course in 1 week? Would doing okayish on the final still let me pass the class? How bad do you think I'd have to do to fail?




Update: Thanks for the feedback everybody, I decided to drop it. I figured I'd rather focus on my other exams and spare the stress. Thanks to the few p/np believers though! I would love to see someone else do this and manage :p

UC Berkeley, UC Davis, or UC Irvine for pre-PA?
I've been putting off committing to a school until literally the last week and am trying to decide which school would be best for me if I am on the pre-PA (physician's assistant) route. I have some pros and cons for each and would love any insight from anyone who was in this kind of predicament. With Berkeley (Undeclared in L&S), a part of me is intimidated by the overwhelming stigma of grade deflation and depressed students. I've also seen some people warn pre-med/healthcare ppl away from Berkeley bc of the limited research opportunities there as a large school. Additionally, but majors I like, Public Health or Bio/Bus, aren't guaranteed. That being said, I've also read how the name brand of Berkeley has helped some students post-grad. With Davis (Biological Sciences), I never really considered going there but they gave me the Regent's Scholarship. I also heard that it's easier to find research/volunteer opportunities at Davis, but I'm scared that the small town will become suffocating. With Irvine (Public Health Sciences), well it's been my one of my dream schools, my older brother is also a current senior and I've visited UCI more often. I really love the vibes, campus, and area that it's in, it's also the school I've imagined myself to be for the longest time. But for pre-PA I've seen ppl say the major I got in for is hard to get into upper div labs, so I think I'd probably have to switch majors. Any insight on the three schools would be really helpful :)!!!

Looking for a fun art class that fulfills the arts and literature breadth that doesn’t require much experience or artistic knowledge!
so i really love art and i think it’s a great way to relax and destress during the year, but i have like -10 artistic ability. are there any classes that teach you how to paint/draw/sculpt without expecting any prior experience?

lost on fall classes + major/life plans :(
(idk why this has a cs flair idk how to get rid of It but this is not cs related really lmao) 

i am a freshman and undecided in my major rn pls help bears lmao. i am interested in medicine, the human body, criminal justice, human rights, public health, entrepreneurial shit like business lol. also mighttt be premed. thinking about prelaw but I AM SO INSANELY LOST ON WHAT TO DO

i am thinking ab the bio+business program. i have not taken any of those req tho bc I j discovered it :(. also, one thing is that if I miraculously got in despite having no business ec, I would have to do ALL my breadths. i worked my ass off to get this mf igetc certification and am done w all l&s requirements+breadths with it. for haas, they do not accept this certificate. so I would have to take 7+ courses. this is kinda deterring me bc that certification was so hard to get as a first-gen who knew nothing about how college works. i also don't even know how passionate i am ab business but i do think the classes r p dope. i would be cool j taking those classes sporadically w/o double majoring, but i feel like only haas majors get priority for those classes? like am i even allowed to take some?

i am also thinking about a data science minor. I've never coded, and being at one of the best cs schools in the world, why not j try a ds minor. seems like a solid skill to have in our tech age. I'm taking data8 this fall for ph major (which idk if I'm set on) and going to see whether i like it enough to minor in ds. I'm also now thinking about the human rights minor. there's even a public health minor if i wanted to j minor in it. bc i am currently done w all my breadths/req i have a ton of room to explore according to an advisor or can grad early (which I'm not going to do bc i get generous fin aid and frosh yr alr robbed bc of covid so i wanna spend my 3 yrs on campus).

due to all this i have acc 0 idea how to plan my 4-year plan. rn I'm thinking about taking: chem3a/3al + data8 + ugba135 (bc idk sht ab finance), and maybe a pe class lmao. but this is only 11.5 units and i need 13 for financial aid. PLS HELP IM SORRY THIS SI SO LONG THANK U FOR READING

tldr: idk what I'm doing w my life

Why should I choose Cal over UCLA?
Hey everyone! I was recently admitted to both UCLA and UC Berkeley within the last weeks. I am so torn because I cannot make up my mind about which university to attend — I’m a prospective ISF major @ USC interested in working in tech / product design roles I am from the Bay Area so it would be super nice to go to SoCal for university, but I know Cal is just overall incredible w tech. I love UCLA but Cal seems like it’s the smarter choice .... I’m just so conflicted. Looking for all honest opinions + pros/cons :)

Thank you so much!!

Taking Art for art and lit breadth?
I was wondering how common/doable it was for someone who doesn't really do art (I have no talent or experience at all) to take a lower div art class for a breadth? Like it would be pretty unreasonable for me to take it if I am to be graded compared to others who have been doing art for a while lol, I'm pretty interested in art 12, art 14, and art 21.

Where should I house?
Hey everyone! I recently got admitted to Berkeley as a transfer student. Money has always been my biggest hurdle in getting higher education. I'm transferring from a small community college because I was able to get free tuition.

Basically, I'm wondering what the cheapest option for housing at Berkeley would be. Is the meal plan really worth it for dorms? Or would I be better off getting groceries and living in an apartment? What's the most affordable route I can take?
--------------------------------------------------
What areas/nearby neighborhoods are good for housing if I am not searching for dorms?

Dept Consent Required for psych major reserved seats, but already declared psych?
Hi! I'm currently a declared psychology major trying to get into psy150, which has 21 reserved seats open for psych majors.

I also don't have any time conflicts and I didn't reach the unit limit. Am I missing something?

Is going to Berkeley for mech eng with plans to go to grad school for aerospace smart?
Berkeley is my favorite school that I have been admitted to. I want to do aerospace engineering and go to grad school, but Cal doesn't have an undergraduate aerospace engineering major (it has mech with a concentration in aero). I also got into UT Austin and GA Tech, both of which are good aerospace schools.

My question is, would I be putting myself at a disadvantage by going to Berkeley (doing mech undergrad and going somewhere that has aero for grad) instead of UT/Tech due to it not having aerospace, or is the experience/silicon valley opportunities worth it?

Thanks!

Wait list with reserved seats
Do the reserved seats get lifted after both enrollment phases are done, or after the first one?

A class I am looking at has tons of open seats for my specific major but I'm already at my cap for class registration (13 units). Is it dangerous to wait for the enrollment phase 2? Or will the non-major wait listed students only get off of the list after both enrollment phases?

Thanks

I got cal grant A last year, but it seems like there is no financial aid offered for my next school year. I'm out of the loop when it comes to this stuff. Is the financial aid on Calcentral final or is it going to change in a few weeks?

Switching Majors at UCB.
Hi. I recently got admitted into the College of Engineering. At the same time, I am also considering doing CS, so I am not too sure on fully pursuing mechanical engineering. If I were to commit to Berkeley, would it be hard to switch from the College of Engineering to the Letter & Sciences as CS major? Is the switching majors process difficult at all? I just do not want to attend Berkeley to waste time, knowing that I cannot switch majors and have to stick to the one I was admitted as. Thank you!

4.) How many units are you typically given?

Thanks!

Physics 137 series as an EECS major

CS 186 or CS161 (or CS188)?
I'm planning to take CS170 alongside one of these classes. I'm having a hard time deciding between 186 vs 161. There's perks to both. 186 is being taught by Josh Hug who's goated and I've heard that knowing databases is actually kinda important in SWE industry. However, I've heard that this class is similar to hilfinger 61b in terms of workload which is a pretty exhausting time. For 161, it seems like it covers some pretty cool topics. I don't know how applicable it can be to industry, but I'm assuming that can be. I've also heard that it has a low workload. Can anyone vouch for this? The only thing is that I hate coding in C lol. Also, another option is 188 since I heard it's one of the easiest cs upper divs in terms of workloads, but they're trying to increase the difficulty. I've also heard that this class is completely useless in terms of practicality. I plan to take it at some point, but idk if i should do it next sem. I wanna devote a lot of time for recruiting next sem so lmk what y'all think!

Sample CS/Haas Schedule?
Hi -- I'm an incoming Class of 25 trying to study CS and be Pre-Haas. Right now, I'm hoping to get 5s on both Econ exams (already got a 5 on Calc BC) so I have to do less courses for Haas. Assuming I'm able to do that, what does a sample schedule for freshman year for someone interested in doing that look like? Here's my plan so far -- but I'm not entirely sure if it's right or doable (or if I should get the CS classes done quicker) so I'd really appreciate help with this :) 


**Frosh Sem 1:**

* CS61A 
* Data 8
* Math54
* Course that satisfies Haas/L&S Social & Behavioral Sciences


**Frosh Sem 2:**

* UGBA 10
* CS61B
* EECS 16B
* Stat88


**Frosh Summer:** 

* CS70

not sure if there are any other commuters in here lol but how are you all going about with fall 2021 (if you also have in person classes like me)? i used to ride BART but i'm not confident that i can in the fall due to covid safety so i'd like to know what other commuters are doing! are you still taking public transportation? finding a new type of transportation? doing something different?

Piece of advice that is saving me this semester
Don't cry over spilled milk.

While I adhered to this advice for the past couple years, it has never helped me as much as it does now. Remote learning is not for me, and I am guessing a lot of you are in the same boat. Focusing is hard, zoom fatigue is real, and the grading is horrific. I have disappointed myself more than I ever had this last year, and it could have been extremely crippling, quite honestly it is. However, keeping in mind that you cannot change the past, only learn from it to improve in the future is powerful.

Dwelling on your failures will only hinder you from succeeding going forward. Keep this in mind. Allow yourself to be sad, angry even, remember the feeling, then move on and never cry over it again. This may sound obvious, but it is so difficult to do.

I wish you all the best in your upcoming finals!

CS61A and Math 1A during the summer
Would the workload be too much? If anyone else have taken both of these classes at the same time during the summer please let me know

Anyone elses class all reserved lol?
I'm in my  4th semester currently and haven't declared my majors yet (econ and applied math for reference), outside of econ 101a, rest of my classes I want to take (math 110, econ 136 etc) are all reserved for majors.

Pass/credit grade policy for transfers?
Hello, I was admitted to Cal as a transfer for Fall 2021. I was wondering what is Berkeley's policy on pass/credit for IGETC courses that are not major related? Thanks!

I write and draw like chicken scratch. How are the art classes here?
Also wanna fulfill the arts and lit breadth but don't wanna get cremated cuz I draw like ass.

Pre-hass prereqs
Does Haas care when you take Econ 1? Is it ok if I did it sophomore year second semester? Also, how is data 8 for a person who has no coding experience
--------------------------------------------------
Anyone took Math 1B after Math 16B?
I couldn't sign up for Paulin's math 1b for last fall and this spring. So I ended up taking math 16b which fulfilled my current major requirement. Now, I'm thinking about changing my major to MCB.I've been told by MCB counsellor to take at least math 1B or Math 53/54/55.  Math 53/54/55's prerequisites are math 1b. Since I have to catch up Big Chems/Bios, Math 53/54/55 sounds too much anyway.I'm debating whether I should take math 1b over the summer or wait till fall for Paulin's course.  I'm not a math person, barely getting A/A- for math 16B level. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks.

data c102 waitlist
im currently 55th on the data c102 waitlist. there are 63 open but reserved seats for stats/ds seniors. i am a declared ds junior. how likely am i going to get off the waitlist? does data 102 ever expand?

Cogsci 131 with Jose Ramirez
Is anyone currently taking or have taken Cogsci 131 with Jose Ramirez? How is he as a professor?
--------------------------------------------------
STAT 140 workload?
What’s the workload like for this class compared to others? For reference I have taken 61abc, 70 ee16ab and 170. I’m definitely taking it next semester but I want to know what CS upperdivs are ok to take alongside it if anyone has experience doing so. My plan is DATA100+STAT140+CS188 at the moment.
--------------------------------------------------
Conditions for Masters Admission?
So I'm a 4th yr undergrad at UC Berk and I accepted admission to M.S. at CMU for ECE. Let's be honest, we all know why I'm here: I'm failing all my classes this semester and trying to figure out the path of least resistance. I've already completed my graduation requirements so does anyone know if I can just withdraw for this semester, graduate, and then slide to CMU? Or is there some kind of threshold for "satisfactory progress" in terms of units and grades? Thanks in advance and gob ears!
--------------------------------------------------
Math 110 Reserved Seats?
does anyone know when the reserved seats for Math 110 will open up? I'm not a math major so the reserved seats don't apply to me. I'm number 9 on the waitlist for lecture and 1 on the waitlist for discussion so I should be guaranteed a spot in the class right?
--------------------------------------------------
Do you get moved up the waitlist after you declare?
I'm currently an undeclared sophomore for CS but should be declared by the end of this semester once I finish CS70. I know that priority is given towards CS majors for the upper divs, so I was wondering if that affects waitlist positions at all
--------------------------------------------------
61C + 170 + data 100 doable for fall?
I am a current sophomore and I want to try really hard to get an internship for next summer as well. Additionally, I hope to have an 8 hour TA position as well. Is this doable?
--------------------------------------------------
Why was I waitlisted in ee16a?
I’m an incoming junior declaring computer science at the end of this semester. I saw there are 900+ open seats for the class, but after enrolling, I got put as number 17 on the waitlist. How likely is it that I get the class, I need to take it next semester to graduate on time.
--------------------------------------------------
ANTHRO 3AC
Has anyone taken ANTHRO 3AC and/or professor Brian Karl ? Or does anyone have any recs or advise for a minor in anthro ?
--------------------------------------------------
Ling 130?
I've only taken 120 and 100 so far and got an A in both. I want to take 130 since it's the only core requirement I can take this sem (not taking 110, dislike phonetics) but I'm a little concerned since I haven't taken morphology or phonology. Will I be okay or should I put it off for a future semester?
--------------------------------------------------
To anyone living in Ridge House or know anything about it..
I recently was offered a spot but am unsure as to whether or not I should take it. I'm curious to know what the environment is like, and also the general cleanliness of this place. It seems that there aren't really any recent photos or videos of it online either. 

Thanks--
--------------------------------------------------
61C or 170?
taking ee16b alongside, don't want to delay it because of the shit about not being able to get in even when i'm a senior. i'll be a junior next sem

Best classes to take with CS 170
**TL;DR WHAT DO I TAKE WITH 170 IF I NEED 2 MORE CLASSES AND I NEED TO RECRUIT**

Hihihi! Incoming junior who's trying to figure out what the hell to take with CS 170. Note that I want to be able to focus on recruiting as well, but I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole of not taking enough classes and suffering later. 

Combinations I've taken in the past and my sentiments about them, maybe we can compare against those: 

\- 61A, 16A (a little stressful, but in hindsight that was mainly bc I was a dumb freshie who didn't know how to study) 

\- 61B, 16B (chaotic, bc projects with Hilfinger and poorly-managed 16B during spring 2020, the semester straight from hell)

\- 61C, 188 (not bad) 

Here's what I'm considering, but TOTALLY OPEN TO OTHER UD. Ideally I want to have four classes, and I already have an UD non-tech (Fung, for those who are curious) 

\- CS 170 + 161 + 186 

\- CS 170 + 126 + IDK

\- CS 170 + 186  + IDK

\- CS 170 + 161  + IDK

\- CS 170 + 127 (though I've heard iffy things about the professor)  + IDK

why are most psych upper divs <200 online?
i looked through every upper div psych course offered for fall 2021, and nearly all of them are online. discussion sections are in person, but not lecture. this was weird to me because the max enrollment for all of them is less than 200 people. anyone know why this is? its really disappointing that a lot of my classes will be online again next semester. i'll probably try to make lecture watch parties or something lol

How many housing options should I apply to as an incoming transfer?
I'm an incoming transfer to Berkeley, and I am *really* hoping to snag some housing. I'm on financial aid and trying to avoid loans at all costs, so cheap is good for me!

So far, I've applied for triples in apartments and doubles in the BSC coops. I'm also considering The Berk and maybe I-House, but I don't know what's overkill and what's playing it safe to make sure I get an offer.

The good thing about applying for apartments is my credit is excellent, I'm non-trad and can be my own guarantor (no co-signer needed), and I've got enough in the bank to do a security deposit or pay the fees associated with moving in.

Basically, I'm just here to ask how much housing should I apply for? Is two enough? Three? I see that transfers have "priority" in housing, but what does that actually mean?
--------------------------------------------------
No help from Berkeley
My daughter was admitted to fall class of 2025 but then immediately told no scholarships or merit aid was available for any out of state students. This effectively says “Do not accept unless you are rich enough to pay $280k for 4 years”. So only to rich people need attend...this fro the school that demand equity of access in education. Hypocrites. Now I have a devastated 18 year I ha dot tell all her hard work was nothing because she has  middle class working parents. 👺👺👺

Foothill for An Incoming Freshman Engineering Student:
Hello, Cal Reddit community! With everything being virtual this year, it has been really hard to get a feel for the housing options. As an engineering student, one of my top options for housing was Foothill. Here is what I have gathered so far:

Pros:

1. Close to the Engineering classes
2. Dining on-site (late-night, etc.)
3. Larger rooms
4. A quieter, cozy feel

Cons:

1. Older building
2. Less connection to the rest of campus
3. The following were based on one student's account
   1. **A rat problem!?!?!**
   2. **Bathrooms not cleaned regularly**

I like the more homey feeling of Foothill, but my concerns mainly stem from the bolded issues (1 and 2 don't bother me too much unless "older" means things are falling apart). The bolded ones simultaneously seem like deal-breakers but also a little exaggerated. I thought I would get some guidance from a larger group of people to see how much veracity there is to these cons and what you all would suggest in general. Any help and advice would be appreciated!

Would I have literally no life or would it be managable ?

Is it a lot of talking ?

Housing
EDIT: #3


I am an incoming international student who has just accepted the admission offer (not showing on CalNet yet, though; it says pending or something like that) I have some questions!

1. I prefer to live alone since I tend to have fluctuating life patterns, meaning I sometimes stay up real late while sometimes I sleep really early. Plus, although I enjoy hanging out with people, I sometimes need personal space. What are some options that I have?
2. If I cannot live alone, I want to find a roommate who shares similar interests and daily patterns. How can I do that?
3. Is everyone forced to live alone at Berkeley for the upcoming year due to the virus?

Thanks in advance!
--------------------------------------------------
how's the covid situation at berkeley?
im a prospective student who's about to commit at any moment. one last thing I wanna make sure before I commit is to know how the school is handling covid. I feel like this is a pretty big indicator as of how the school is treating the students. the other school im considering is quite good at dealing with covid so this is the final dealbreaker for me. im mainly curious about how many in-person classes/online classes do most student take? are social events all prohibited? does the school do covid tests regularly and frequently? any input will be great, thx :))

Looking for a third roommate
Me and a friend have a two bedroom two bath apartment at the standard. It's only a block a away from the south side of campus. We're looking for someone to live in the double. Since two will be in the double and one in the single, the rent per person for the double will be 1/4th the total rent, which is about $1450 per person. Please let me know if you're interested. If you want to check out the floor plan, you can go to the standard's website and look for the Bexley in the 2 bedroom options.

Housing?
I am an incoming freshman who just accepted my admission offer, but I just heard that the housing applications are due in a few days. I am in panic now! What am I supposed to do?

CS61B, Econ 100B, EEC16B, UGBA10, Data 8
which ones should I phase 1?
I’m leaning towards 61B, Data 8, and UGBA10 at the moment but please let me know what you guys think!

I’m basically putting Data 8 in there because i’m taking CS70 over the summer and want a safety net if i won’t be able to declare CS

Please let me know what you guys think, thanks!

How bad is Stat 88 really??? help pls
Hi, a stressed bear here wondering if a stat 88 x physics 8a combo over the summer is a bad idea... For context, I have very little background in both stats and physics, but I've heard that the prof this summer is relatively chill and that that class is also much easier in the summer. Stat 88 is the killer though, I'm super unsure/unconfident in stat in general... pls help! <3
--------------------------------------------------
EECS 16A or 16B Summer?
Surprised that neither is being offered as of now.  Is there still a chance they find a instructors? Also, do any CC’s offer 16A equivalent? I’ve heard that Chabot College does, but not in the summer.
--------------------------------------------------
Anyone take PH 112?
Has anyone taken Public Health 112 and know what the difficulty is like in the regular year/ also in the summer? I'm looking for an international studies breadth as an MCB major, and this class looks super interesting :) but I can't seem to find any info on it. If anyone knows anything about this class please let me know!!

More debt or less debt ?
I’m a 2021 transfer. ( international student) I got admitted to Berkeley and Cal Poly SLO. Admitted to CS major. ( although thinking to switch to information system) 

Now. Idk which one to pick, though it seems cal poly is the right choice. 

I’m an international student, and I have been paying triple money ever since. However, this year prior to transfer, my family went bankrupt .. all properties back home got sold for company cash flow..  lost my uncle.. mom got sick. Huge trauma. 

Anyways, I have calculated all costs and my savings.. ( including all possible financial aid)
here are two options: 

-  I’ll be in debt for cal poly SLO for estimated 30k 
I’ve also read posts and watched videos about how Cal Poly is a predominantly white school. I’m Asian, and I don’t grew up in U.S. I’m not sure what that means for me to be in Cal Poly with little diversity.  


OR

- I’ll be in debt for Berkeley for estimated 65k. 
Berkeley is internationally recognisable. And my goal is work in U.S after graduating. So I think cal poly would do just fine, in terms of finding jobs wise.    


So.. I hope I’m making the right choice..
--------------------------------------------------
is 61b + cs 70 good enough for info 159?
as in the title—or are there other courses you recommend I take before info159?

Also, would it be doable taking info 159 with cs 170 (along with econ1 and data 100)?
--------------------------------------------------
Do these courses expand for waitlisted students?
\-Data 100

\- Stat 88

\-Econ 1
--------------------------------------------------
is data 8 a must for taking data 100?
Or can you still do well in Data 100 without having taken data 8—given you do have programming background 61A+B but no stats background at all, like not even from high school)? 

(clarification: I'm not a DS major, so I don't think I \*have\* to take Data 8, and it'd help in my schedule if I don't have to take Data 8, but I still am not so sure about skipping an intro course.)
--------------------------------------------------
