Foster decision
Hi is there anyone out there who hasn’t heard from Foster like me? I heard the decision came out yesterday but I haven’t received any email since. I’m so worried!
--------------------------------------------------
Info hopefuls thread
Anybody else see this subreddit and see every major releasing their decisions and we INFO hopefuls still have to wait? Lol. It really builds the anxiety, yanno? If anyone has anything they want to say or just talk, comment, pm, it don't matter. We're all stressing here lmao
--------------------------------------------------
INFO 430?
How is INFO 430 with Greg?

I heard it's a repeat of 330, but I took 330 with Randal Root (which I heard is easier than Greg's) so I'm not sure if I should take 430

UW Advisors
Hi Reddit, I am turning here because I am not sure where else to get this information.

Does anyone know how to engage in a complaint process about a UW employee? Does anyone know what people or department or anything I can go to, to file a complaint about misinformation that I have been given?

&#x200B;

One of my majors has an internship requirement and they referred me to this program that UW partners with to guarantee internship placement in Washington, DC and NYC. However, it turns out this program is kind of a sham and after two months of working with this program they said they can't guarantee me an internship. This directly contradicts the Info sessions that the UW Advisor hosted and the information about the program she has shared with in mass emails to students in our major. Additionally, she did not reveal to me all of the true costs about the program and the additional fees (in thousands of dollars) I have to pay.

&#x200B;

To make things worse, this individual is the head of advising for the department, which means I can't go to another advisor and I don't know who to contact now.

Can Snapchat Sustain a Friendship? [Anonymous Survey]
Hello all! I am an undergraduate student at UW in the COM major and I’m running a study on how the use of the social media app Snapchat is influencing feelings of connection within friendships during the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, I’m looking to recruit college students from around the country who use Snapchat to take a **short, 15 minute, anonymous survey** about their experiences thus far in the pandemic in regard to how connected they are feeling to their friends.

ESS 211 and Phys 227 classes overlap?
Question, I'm doing ESS Physics option and to start the series I need to take ESS 211 and Phys 227 this fall. Both are required classes for my degree, both are offered the same quarters, and both have one section at the exact same time. Is there any way around this? Why are two required classes scheduled to conflict like this?

Need advice about time management
Hi, I'm wondering what is the best way to manage my time as a student. I don't find one tool that has it all. What do you think?  
If you are willing to share what tools do you use and if you're satisfied or not it can really help me.  
Thanks :)

Studying in dorms? Is it a good idea?
Hey guys! Incoming Freshman. So I was just wondering whether studying in dorms is ideal. I know a lot of people usually just go to libraries, but it seems nice to have a place to unwind and be comfortable before starting a study session. Though, I'm worried about how loud it'll be. How well do the RA's enforce quiet hours at night? I'd really love if it was on the stricter side, since dorms are the only other place, other than libraries, that provide some sort of refuge from noise and activity. For reference, I plan on staying in Maple. Thanks in advance!

Greek Row Blasting Music Since 7 This Morning
Big shoutout to Greek Row for helping me get up in the morning feeling refreshed and energized for the rest of today!

By being hit in the face with a solid combination of nonsensical brash EDM/Rap, I have now finished my previous night's work by 8am and I'll be spending the rest of my day studying for midterms. 

Really appreciate taking the hit for us so that we could all study in a happier and brighter environment!

Sincerely, a guy in North Campus living directly across from Greek Row.

TRANSFER QUESTIONS?!
Does anyone know when transfer students receive their decisions? I’ve heard between early May- late June but some say late July. Other got in yesterday so I’m confused. Also, how does the competition work for transfers regarding to our majors?
--------------------------------------------------
Dorm questions and preferred roommate
I’m an incoming freshman (accepted in the school of th engineering, yay!) and I have a couple questions about the on-campus living situation.
1. How likely is it that I will be paired with my preferred roommate? 
I’m planning on applying to Hansee hall with my friend and a few other people that we know but I’m wondering if we’ll even get a room together. I heard that some people didn’t get their preferred roommates and if not, is there a way that I could switch dorms to be with?
2. Are there better residence halls for dorming with roommates? 
I saw in the website that for Hansee, there weren’t many multi-people units available and had the most rooms for single-living situations. My friends and I are choosing Hansee because it’s the cheapest we can get for 2+ people but are there other halls that may also be worth some of the money if we can live together?


Thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to read my post! I apologize for any grammar/formatting error as I’m on my phone.

To all the UW CS applicants who got rejected: how to appeal
Don't give up! 

Got rejected from both the major and the UW, I appealed and got accepted into CS (transfer student). Below is the link to appeal. Recently, a lot of my friends and other redditors have asked me about the CS appeal process, so I'll just make a post here. The link below is how I sent my appeal. 

[https://admit.washington.edu/apply/freshman/i-applied/special-admission-appeal/](https://admit.washington.edu/apply/freshman/i-applied/special-admission-appeal/)

&#x200B;

\*keep in mind that appeal chances are way lower than normal admission, so be very ready to accept other university offers and don't count on getting appeals accepted. 

\*I can't share my appeal letter, sorry.
--------------------------------------------------
As if waiting for Foster/Department decision was not stressful enough. Good luck to all of my fellow transfer students and of course freshman out there!!!

Laptop recommendations for starting college
Hi, I’m an incoming freshman and I currently have a DELL but it’s super slow and it’s so hard to get it to work.  Starting college might be a good reason to get a new laptop. I don’t know much about them, so, which laptops have worked for you in the past?

Questions about UW Academy
I’d like to know a couple things about the academy program, specifically the CS route.

I applied both as a freshman and as an acad and got both acceptances, however I didn’t get into CS and just got my appeal rejection -_-. 

I still have hope for CS since about 85% of academy students applying to CS get in. I’d like to understand how not to be part of that 15% that don’t get in considering academy students seem to be quite competitive.

I’m slightly concerned since I’ve already finished the CS prereqs at a CC which may be viewed as less rigorous and hurt my chances when I apply. Would it be a good idea to hold off on applying to CS early and flesh out my classes? Considering I’m almost 2 years ahead of most my acad peers I have time to take advanced or honors classes. If you got into CS or a similarly constrained major as an acad what did you do to ensure your success in getting in?

Also, if I don’t get into my first choice major, how easy is it to get into something similar like informatics/applied math? I imagine those majors won’t affect my opportunities that much anyways.

I guess my more general questions will be answered at academy meetings down the line. Anyways, I’m super excited to come to UW!

I've been on this sub long enough to know what to expect from phys 121 and math 125, but I haven't heard much from math 307. I hear it's nothing like the calc series, but that doesn't help much. Can someone who's taken the class explain what it's like?

tbh I just need something to get me up to 12+ credits.

Questions about classes
So my dad and I last week listened to the Stats department info session and they said to apply to be a stats major I had to take the following prerequisites: 

Math 124, 125, 126 + math 224


Stat 311 or 390 

And lastly CSE 142 or CSE 160.


I was wondering if these were the prerequisites if I only took those classes to apply for the stats department. And if so what other classes would I take? 

Would I take some elective classes or just other classes to fill in the requirements for a minor? 

Also I heard that you shouldn’t take more than 2 STEM classes a quarter (as advice) and do you agree? 

My mom also said I should take 3 classes my first quarter to get used to the quarter system/ college ( do you agree) 

ALSO HOW MANY CLASSES DO PEOPLE USUALLY TAKE PER QUARTER? 

Also! I’m open to other suggestions and advice about just the academic life at UW! And open to what professors I should possibly avoid :’)

Edit: I’ve heard math 124,125,126 were weed out classes
--------------------------------------------------
When do Foster Transfer Applications decisions come out? I'm seeing UW student decisions right now.

Mechatronics
How accepting and competitive is the mechatronics option within ME? I want to join my senior year however I feel as if I have very little experience in any mechatronic related projects and have built very little connections amongst my fellow peers. If I get accepted into the program will I struggle at all with the courses and capstone project? I want to not only exceed but feel as if I belong in the environment. Any insight on this matter?
--------------------------------------------------
HCDE decisions?
Has anybody received HCDE decisions? I heard they’re supposed to come out today, and it’s looking like a lot of the other engineering majors have released their decisions, but I haven’t gotten an email yet

Transfer decision

I was heading over to my cs departmental application to have a look at my application status. The transcript processed coloum says "none" but the admission decision says "decline". Does this mean my decision was made without even looking at my transcript?

Anticipated spring GPA: 3.87
Strong essay in my opinion 

EC's : a whole lot of sports and drumming

PS: transfer applicant from none of the Washington community colleges. Could this be a reason to my rejection?

Accept/Reject Student Loan Offer
I have been offered a "Federal Direct Unsubsidized" student loan as well as a parent loan. I'm not sure if I should accept them or not and apparently the deadline is today.

Yes, I should've talked to a financial advisor about this before, I'm a horrible procrastinater and although I've made an appointment for the first available date, I'm afraid it will be too late.

I don't really understand what it means to accept or reject these loans. If I accept and change my mind later will I be able to back out of them?

Should I commit to UW?
Hi everyone! High school senior here. Tomorrow is college decision day, and I'm feeling really nervous. I feel like everyone has already committed and I'm one of the few who haven't.

As of right now, I'm currently deciding between UW and WWU. I want to major in either CS or Biology, and I know about the whole "don't come to UW if you want to do CS", but I was accepted to the STARS program at UW (which is a 2-year program that guarantees you placement into an engineering major). However, I was also accepted into a CS scholars program at WWU. In the end, I don't know which college I want to attend because both have their consequences and benefits.

**UW PROS:** STARS program, better location (45-minute drive from home), my dream school, very generous aid (so I won't have loans or debt)

**UW CONS:** STARS program won't accept Running Start college credits (plus bc of the program itself, I'll have to go to school for 5 years), more academically rigorous, a bigger school so not sure if it's the right environment for me, got an F in a class so *possible* rescindment/probation? (admissions said that failing a class isn't usually something they rescind for, but it's case-by-case)

**WWU PROS:** CS scholars program, smaller school, will accept Running Start credits, less competitive

**WWU CONS**: Location (about 2-hour drive from home), offering me 17k in financial aid (COA is about 26k), not as prestigious (not sure how much that really matters)

Can anyone offer me any insight into what I should prioritize when making a decision? Or any pros/cons to each school that I didn't mention? Also, if anyone wants to share anecdotes/how their experience at UW has been, I would love to hear that as well.

Safety for women on campus and surrounding area
I'm an OOS student who is moving to seattle for the MSW program this July. Right now I live in the rural midwest and used to live in the suburbs in minnesota. I'm female and, although I am in my late 20's, I look much younger. All that to say I've never lived in a city and I'm nervous about walking by myself and feeling safe. Other ladies- do you feel safe around campus? Does anyone carry pepper spray or other self defense items? I'm really excited to get the good parts of living in a city but it does freak me out a bit.

How bad does a Registrar Drop annotation look on a transcript?
I’m not doing too great in one of my classes and it’s been affecting my mental health. I don’t think it’ll get any better and it’s an elective so I’ve been considering doing the Late Drop/Current Quarter Drop. The registrar’s page says they’ll be an annotation on my transcript that I dropped it and I’m hoping to get into a good grad school so I’m wondering if the annotation will look bad/hurt my chances?

MORE SIGNATURES NEEDED: SIGN THE PETITION FOR A RECALL ELECTION ON ASUW PRESIDENT
As more details have come to light, it's become abundantly clear that ASUW President Camille Hattwig flagrantly abused her powers and engaged in petty corruption with her email two days ago that used false accusations of racism to silence criticism from The Daily.

I won’t go into too much detail about whether The Daily’s article was racist or not because it’s been discussed extensively on this sub such as [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/n0rlj3/opinionated_overview_the_whole_beef_between_the/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/n190ov/unpopular_opinion_criticizing_asuw_candidates_as/). Link to an archived version of the original article is [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210428232354/https://www.dailyuw.com/opinion/article_98fe0652-a645-11eb-8917-a7c8c54dae46.html) and cartoon [here](https://preview.redd.it/yvd4q5t2ozv61.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=a90dfd1f3c40f2ead992a6a457b65913ace3b830) so you can decide for yourself. To me and most others there isn’t a racist interpretation even in the least charitable view.

A false accusation of racism by itself is abhorrent because every false accusation lessens the seriousness with which people take a genuine one. But only when viewed in context of the election does it become clear that a recall election is necessary. Here’s the full context:

1. ASUW didn’t properly advertise filing deadlines so every position in the upcoming election consists of an insider running unopposed
2. The Daily published an article with genuine concerns about how prepared the candidates are and how fair the election really is if every position consists of an unopposed insider
3. The reporting upset the candidates and their friends to the point that they tricked themselves into seeing racism in nothing. Sharing the same interests as the candidates, Camille bowed to their pressure and sent out a sensational email to the entire student body repeating the candidate’s false claims. She acted unilaterally without consulting other board members.
4. The Daily caved under the weight of Camille’s heavy accusations and retracted their criticism of the election. Imagine if the Seattle City Council used false claims of racism to coerce The Seattle Times into retracting criticism of them around an election. It’s simply unacceptable.

It’s clear from these events that ASUW has serious problems that need to be reformed. Only under the publicity of a recall election will these events come to light and provide the intense scrutiny from the student body needed for any reforms to occur. 90% of students still think Camille’s claims of racism are genuine and only with the publicity of a recall election will that change.

This petition isn’t to directly recall the ASUW president, which is warranted, but to instead order a recall election that will provide the needed public scrutiny. We need to come together to show that we won't tolerate cronyism from government.

Link to the petition  [https://forms.gle/VtNAvATYz9xahP7A9](https://forms.gle/VtNAvATYz9xahP7A9). Signatures are only valid if you're a current ASUW member so double check that here, you can opt in at any time [https://sdb.admin.uw.edu/sisStudents/uwnetid/op\_charges.aspx](https://sdb.admin.uw.edu/sisStudents/uwnetid/op_charges.aspx).

So far we have \~400 signatures and we need upwards of 2,000 to order the recall election (still getting clarification on the exact number needed). We have a long ways to go but I know we can get there.

List of a potential violation by ASUW's BoD President Camille Hattwig
To start with, I am an incoming graduate student from out-of-state with no involvement in ASUW, however, I do have multiple years of experience serving in my undergraduate university's student governments. After reading the recent situation with ASUW and The Daily, I believe Camille Hattwig and any other officers involved in the sending of the mass email, should face some consequences for their targeted harassment and bully behavior. I have compiled a basic list of *potential* violations. The elections rules seem to be applicable if is she is affiliated with or advocates for any of the candidates, but I included them in case y'all know more about her campaign involvement. I make no guarantees that any of these necessarily apply, but I do believe publishing a list is necessary for anybody wanting to make a complaint. Here's a list of potential violations:

&#x200B;

From the [ASUW Constitution](http://records.asuw.org/getDecision.php?id=5):

Article 8 § 4A: "The Student Senate has the power to consider and approve resolutions of student opinion, which stand as the official opinion of the ASUW in the manner prescribed by this Section. **No other body of the ASUW may formulate official\* ASUW student opinion.**" \*See below

&#x200B;

From the [ASUW Bylaws](http://records.asuw.org/getDecision.php?id=6):

Article 1 § 2G: "\[The President shall\] serve as the **official** spokesperson of the ASUW in campus, community, and inter-school relationships;"

Article 1 § 2T: "\[The President shall\] handle major public relations efforts with national and local press **in coordination with the Communications Director**;" Did she coordinate with the communications director first?

&#x200B;

From the [ASUW Communications Policy](http://comm.asuw.org/files/2018/10/Current-ASUW-Communications-Policy-edited-Spring-2018.pdf):

Section 4 § 1e: "ASUW employees remain expected to use their assigned ASUW email accounts to communicate with individuals and entities external to the ASUW." Instead of using her personal email to share her individual opinion, her use of the main ASUW email account for the accusations suggests it was an official communication.

Section 5 § 3.b.ii: "**No negative language about any group, person, or entity shall ever be posted by any entity or initiative pages associated with the ASUW**."

&#x200B;

From the [2021 Elections Policies and Procedures](http://vote.asuw.org/rules/):

Section 5 § 6: "No ASUW employee, volunteer, appointee, entity, or committee may make endorsements in their official capacity such as using their title or position; and no ASUW equipment or supplies, including employment time or office hours, phones, office machines, office space, and email accounts, may be used for campaign purposes, except as authorized by the EAC. Any candidate or ballot measure advocate receiving an endorsement from an ASUW employee, volunteer, or appointee in personal capacity must, when campaigning with such endorsement, clearly state that such endorsement is in the individual’s personal capacity only."

Section 6 § 2.2: "\[Campaigning includes\] addressing crowds to promote or oppose a ballot measure or candidate."

Section 6 § 2.5: "\[Campaigning includes\] use of electronic or social media to publicly promote or oppose a ballot measure or candidate."

Section 6 (weird formatting): "Candidates, Affiliates, and Ballot Measure Advocates may not campaign while acting in an official capacity of the ASUW."

Section 6 § 3.7: "\[No candidate, candidate’s affiliate, ballot measure advocate, or ballot measure advocate’s affiliate may, in the course of campaigning\] **use electronic media to interfere with the neutrality of the ballot**..."

Section 6 § 3.10: "**Violating any applicable law, whether federal, state, or local is a severe violation.**" Depending on how liberally you interpret her email and the laws, one *could* argue it was a libel against The Daily as an organization.

Section 7 § 8.7: "\[No candidate, candidate’s affiliate, ballot measure advocate, or ballot measure advocates affiliate may\] **use any force, threat or unlawful means to hinder or deter any voter from voting, or to obtain a vote for or against any candidate or ballot measure**."

Section 9 § 6: "**Liability exists for even unintentional or unknowing violations**, unless intent or knowledge is an essential element of the provision violated."

Section 10 § 4.2: "**\[Complaints may allege a violation by\] an entity of the ASUW**."

&#x200B;

To conclude, this is not a personal vendetta against Camille. I do think, as someone who cares about student body representation and making serious, progressive change, her actions as an ASUW official should warrant repercussions as outlined by ASUW's governing documents. If you are making a complaint, please follow the procedures laid out in [Section 11](http://vote.asuw.org/rules/). **Please do not harass or violate the privacy of anyone!**

An outsider’s thoughts on the ASUW stuff
I know there’s been a ton of dialogue on ASUW and the Daily drama recently so I thought I’d join in. 

First, I’m an incoming freshman so I’m not a student at UW yet. I don’t fully understand everything around this issue but from the information I’ve gathered I’ve come to the following conclusions:

1) The ASUW president overstepped by sending out that mass email. I’m a bit up in the air on whether she should be recalled but I think I’m leaning towards the opinion that she should.
2) I’m very disappointed in the ASUW as an institution. They don’t seem to reflect the student body and I would like to see some reforms put in place to ensure representatives actually represent the students.
3) The ASUW needs to stop complaining and start getting stuff done. College is way way way too expensive and the ASUW should organize around bringing this cost down and improving the quality of life for students. 
4) The Daily’s cartoon wasn’t racist. It was just a list of campus landmarks and was in no way tied to candidates. If, however, the Daily had drawn that cartoon so that the landmarks each corresponded to a specific candidate so that the animals corresponded to BIPOC candidates, that’d be racist. 

That’s just my 2 cents that nobody asked for. I might run for ASUW next year just to raise these issues ngl 

TLDR; I wanna see change in the ASUW.

Very fortunate to have been accepted to both AMATH and ACMS. Of course, I have to choose one or the other. I am curious if the AMATH degree is more recognizable to employers, and therefore individuals with AMATH over ACMS can get hired a bit easier?

Any thoughts are greatly appreciated.

UW email question
Hello,

I'm an incoming freshman who's been getting emails from UW from my personal email. I got an email that said that future communications would be through the UW email, and that I could access it by going to MyUW and then clicking the "email" button. However, when I press this button, it redirects me to my personal email. Is this a mistake? I can't access my UW email because that's the only way I know to get to it but it goes to my personal email.

UW CSE DA FRESHMAN APPEAL
Since it is the end of the month has anyone heard back yet?
--------------------------------------------------
(Semi-opiniated) summary of last nights ASUW BOD meeting
During the first \~15 minutes, some BSU representatives speak and thank Camille and the ASUW board for their "professionalism." Followed by member of the public asking ASUW why they sent a mass alarmist email to tens of thousands of people. Camille says they're "not doing back-and-forth" and doesn't provide a response. (I'm unclear if this is standard for public forums, so maybe give her the benefit of the doubt here?)

Bulk of the meeting (over an hour) was about pretty standard/hiring/administrative stuff. 

Time was allocated at the end for the board to discuss The Daily. One of the board members asked about the email, why it was sent out, and who knew about it. Camille said she met with "all relevant stakeholders" prior to the email being sent. Board member pushes a bit more on the stakeholders question, Camille says it's not an appropriate discussion for a board meeting.

Board member asks if she met with The Daily, as they are a relevant stakeholder. Camille waffles a bit, and says that yes, The Daily was consulted prior to the mass email being sent. 

(Wild accusation: based on the context here, I got the feeling that she was misrepresenting the truth. The Daily's response doesn't really line up with what she was saying here, and she made it very clear that she was more concerned with stakeholders other than The Daily. )

Camille speaks about her rationale for sending the email. She argued that since the original racist cartoon was sent to every student, she needed to send a follow-up response to every student. Says that it's important to "show support for the students being harmed by the institutions at play." 

(Look, I don't know about the rest of you, but I regularly see The Daily in my inbox. I don't regularly see alarmist emails from the ASUW president. There was no fucking reason to send this spam to everyone.)

She went on and explained that the BOD candidates have the least amount of power in this situation, because The Daily can reach tens of thousands of people, so she felt compelled to use her power to do the same to support the candidates. She said her biggest concern and the point of her statement was not "what the public thinks," its the impact this has had on Black students. "The goal was not to explain things clearly or make the broader student community understand."

(It's true the candidates don't have access to a mailing list of the student body. But they will next year. To put it another way, they're unopposed candidates for public office, they are guaranteed to have power next year, no matter what The Daily does or says. It's frankly mind-boggling, then, that the current administration thinks its appropriate to step into this fight use their power to attack the press.)

Camille starts talking about next steps for ASUW, and what steps they can take to "never worry again about students of color being targeted." The board discusses options for potentially taking further actions against The Daily, specifically options to censure/censor The Daily.

(Okay, the wording is really important here, and even with context, I'm honestly not sure if they were talking about censuring or censoring. Regardless, either would effectively be a government action against the free press).

Then the board start talking about how much they appreciate The Daily's independent reporting. Camille says that critiquing the ASUW is well within The Daily's right (yet they continue talking about "accountability" measures.) The meeting mostly winds down after this.

Overall, I'm unhappy with ASUW's conduct and their attacks on The Daily are concerning at best. Curious if anyone else who attended the meeting has additional thoughts.

International Freshman Job Opportunities
I’m an incoming international freshman and I plan on working part time so that I have extra cash for allowance. Are there any international students here who work? What was the process and what are the limitations (Min wage, Max hours, etc.)? 

I’ve done some research and found out that I can only work in the UW campus, otherwise I will be breaking the rules of my F1 visa. 

I am knowledgeable in photography but I don’t really have a preference for work. As long as I can earn money.

Thanks!

What is happening with CS/CE appeals?
I applied to CS out-of-state (really tough to get in, I know) and I appealed the decision on April 1st. I still have not received a word back besides a automated email from UW saying that my appeal had been received.

Has anyone received their CSE, CE, or CS appeals?

Also, what happens if I don’t get the appeal decision before the May 1st college decision deadline? If I get the appeal back and I got accepted, would it still be possible to commit to UW even after May 1st?

So how long can I wait to sign a lease without missing out on a decent place?

Jumping into Electrical Engineering from pre-sciences?
Hello all,  
  
I was wondering about the viability of making this transition. From my research, it looks like an ok jump if you can do well in those pre-requisite classes... but of course I'd have to ace those. I'm trying to decide whether it would be worth the jump. I wasn't admitted DTC engineering since I applied to the Allen school, and I know for sure a jump to CS from pre-sciences would be near impossible. From anyone's experiences, is this a viable option? Or should I consider WSU? Thanks!

ASUW Board Meeting Tonight at 5:30
For those who want to hear from the Board in light of yesterday's events, they are holding one of their forums tonight where students can hear and weigh in. Here is the agenda with the link: [http://records.asuw.org/Documents/Board%20of%20Directors/2021%20Board%20of%20Directors%20Agendas/20210428-04.29.2021%20Board%20Agenda.pdf](http://records.asuw.org/Documents/Board%20of%20Directors/2021%20Board%20of%20Directors%20Agendas/20210428-04.29.2021%20Board%20Agenda.pdf)

It should go without saying, but ***please do not harass or berate ASUW Board members, employees, or the Daily***, regardless of your stance. These meetings are actually done to get stuff done surrounding student services and issues we use/address regularly, so while you can weigh in...if you do tune in, please let business proceed normally.

On the other hand, they are designed to connect ASUW to the student body, and addressing student concerns/issues/etc. is one of the main things these forums are for.

Update: Board stated they will not be "entertaining cross-talk during public forum" and would not respond. Public forum part is now over--which is really the only time you can speak directly. This was not on them--it is routine to close it if there is a long silence and no one else speaks. Tune in if you want, but not sure what you will get out of it :(

Edit: brain no word good.

$19985.21
That's how many student dollars are being paid out to Camille Hatwig this year to send alarmist accusations of racism against our student newspaper without providing any context or citation to thousands of subscribed students.

* The Executive Team of the ASUW is allocated **$105333** for wages.
* The rest of the board is allocated **$76890** for wages.
* Your elected BOD is being paid **$182,223** for their work this year. Can you name a single thing any member of the Board has done for you as a student this year?
* The two student staff members of the Elections Administration Committee are allocated **$16,000** in wages. Additionally, they have access to about **$6800** in operations funds, for programming and marketing. Did you see a single advertisement encouraging students to run for the ASUW BOD Elections this year?

Just some fun numbers for you all, but *these are your dollars and your representatives.*  


Edit: Thank you to whoever pointed out that I auto-corrected Camille to 'Camel,' that wasn't intentional and I promise I'm not childish enough to do that on purpose. I also want to emphasize that **my purpose in sharing these numbers isn't to suggest that we stop paying student leaders. Students deserve fair, livable wages, and I commend the ASUW for providing meaningful and accommodating positions to students. I did, however, provide this information to remind people that these aren't casual volunteers whose actions don't affect you. You technically pay them, so don't feel bad about attending a board meeting, emailing your questions, or using their office hours.**

I came here to learn, and because I was invited to the Paul Allen school, not to be the best of the best.

A Follow-Up on My "Opinionated Overview" and How You Can Take Appropriate Action
I have seen a lot of posts and calls for action that have good intent behind them, but after all I have learned and read in the last 24 hours, I fear that many of the petitions and calls for action may not actually result in the real, long-lasting change that many of us desire. Many of you have read [my post from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/n0rlj3/opinionated_overview_the_whole_beef_between_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) about the email that was sent out from the ASUW president to every student. I was seeing a lot of talk solely about whether the cartoon was racist or not and my aim in making yesterday's post was to steer some of that discussion towards the abuse of power in sending that email the email that sparked all of this discussion. The post got a lot more attention than what I expected and now after nearly over 100 comments, over a dozen private messages, and the reading and rereading of other posts and articles, I feel as though I should do a bit more than encourage people to write-in "Dubs I" for all of the positions.

First, to briefly highlight 2 important issues surrounding the controversy:

1. The inspiration behind the article and cartoon from The Daily came from the fact that the EAC (those who run the election at ASUW) violated their own [Elections Policies and Procedures](http://vote.asuw.org/rules/) (EPP) by not properly spreading awareness about the election and surrounding deadlines to those outside of ASUW. The tactics used by The Daily to bring attention to this in their "endorsement" article are debatable at best, but nevertheless it is an important issue that needs to be discussed and [you can read more about how the nuances of The Daily's article and the election problems in a reply I made in the original thread from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/n0rlj3/opinionated_overview_the_whole_beef_between_the/gwbtqoz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).
2. The mass email was a complete overreach and an abuse of power on the part of the ASUW leadership. A personal email to every UW student claiming that our student-run paper published racist imagery targeting other students should never have been approved by a board of advisors or directors. An official statement surrounding the article and cartoon from the ASUW is to be expected and no ill feelings should be sent their way simply for having their view on the matter, but this statement should have been made on social media where discussion about the cartoon and racial issues and biases could have actually occurred. This would have been a better approach than to just tell students what to think without means to respond in a meaningful way.

&#x200B;

**Here's the part where you can learn how to take action:**

**For the issues surrounding the election itself:** The ASUW has its own rules on elections they call the Elections Policies and Procedures. ([http://vote.asuw.org/rules/](http://vote.asuw.org/rules/)). If any of you can find any part of those rules that you think the candidates, the board of directors, or the people running the election (which the rules call the 'EAC') may have violated, **you can file a complaint before the 10th** using the pdf on this page ([http://vote.asuw.org/violations/](http://vote.asuw.org/violations/)). There are specific instructions for who to email the form to on that page too.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you submit a complaint ***you*** ***WILL have to attend a hearing on the 13th to make your case.*** If you do not show up, your complaint will be automatically thrown out. I understand that this may put a lot of people off because thus far have been able to remain anonymous but know that I will be filing a complaint and I will be attending the hearing myself if need be. I am certainly nervous about publicly standing up for this issue, attaching my name and face to these posts, but I feel strongly about this issue and I am willing to stand up for it. If you are a BIPOC student or a member of another marginalized group who feels that, despite the diverse ballots, the ASUW still does not do enough to address the issues you care about *now is your chance!* If the ASUW wants to preserve that status quo by keeping election information under wraps and removing your opportunity to make an impact, make your own opportunity!

&#x200B;

**For the issues surrounding the email:** Be wary of calls to recall Camille Hattwig. Yes, the email is signed by her, but this does not mean the decision to send the email was all on her own. This may have been drafted and approved by a whole board of directors and simply signed in her name or something else entirely, but we do not know the process behind sending out emails like this. Regardless of what you think of her or the ASUW's opinion, we need to make changes to the way mass communication is made and petitions to simply recall the president will most likely (and somewhat ironically) be seen as an overreaction and not be taken seriously by anyone at the ASUW or in the university administration.

The email is a bit harder to tackle and has a lot more a nuanced approach, so whatever you feel is necessary, I encourage you to do. Having said that, I have set up a [petition](http://chng.it/Ljm9FZtCtc) demanding an evaluation of why the email was sent, to make sure it never happens again, and that appropriate action is taken against whomever approved the email. Here is the raw link for easy sharing: [http://chng.it/Ljm9FZtCtc](http://chng.it/Ljm9FZtCtc).

&#x200B;

Thank you to everyone who has reached out to me and commented on my post. I really appreciate a lot of the thoughtful discussion that has been going on despite some outliers. I sincerely hope we are able to make the substantial change that many of us desire.

TLDR: There are ways you can make more substantial and long-lasting change occur from this event than what has been proposed thus far. Here is a link to the ASUW policy violation complaint form: [http://vote.asuw.org/violations/](http://vote.asuw.org/violations/). Here is a link to a petition aiming to resolve issues surrounding the email: [http://chng.it/Ljm9FZtCtc](http://chng.it/Ljm9FZtCtc).

The ASUW Conspiracy?
I've been reading a lot about ASUW over the past 24 hours in light of what's been going on, and holy fuck if this student org doesn't look like the most corrupt one party thing ever.

Not only did their leader have the ability to send out a "waah I'm angry" email to the ENTIRE student body about that daily being "racist" because they called out the fact the current ASUW elections are a sham, but now the Daily is bending over backwards to apologize to the ASUW overlords as well. Probably because they are scared of the repercussions of taking a stand.

Someone also commented on another post here that ASUW opened up submissions to be elected for a board position ONLY FIVE FUCKING DAYS before the submission was due??? What kind of reasonable student body would give you five days to apply for something out of the blue? It sounds like a big fucking scam to me, where all of the little ASUW insiders elect themselves over and over again to feel good - fuck the rest of the student population at UW apparently.

The worst part is that next week this whole thing is going to wash under the rug. Even if we get the needed signatures for the recall I doubt anything fruitful is going to come from it. I get that its zoom classes right now and 99% of the student population just wants to get their degree and get out but it pisses me off that our "student government" is just an elitist shit show.

Genome 361 grade scale
I have a question regarding grading scale for my genome 361 course, or just grading in general. When it says “grades will be determined by linear interpolation between the 4.0 and 0.7 scores,” does that mean the lowest possible grade you could get is a 0.7 (threshold for passing) in the course? I’m just worried bc I’m graduating this quarter and need to pass this course to graduate, but going thru a lot this quarter.

Unpopular Opinion: Criticizing ASUW candidates as "lazy” and “unprepared” is the best thing you could do
This [article](https://www.dailyuw.com/opinion/article_fbe3722a-a901-11eb-9b60-bfd0ee0e37e4.html) just published by the Daily:

"Even though we don't believe we saw the candidates at their best, “lazy” and “unprepared” should not have been used to describe them."

If we are all equal despite our identity differences then the free press should be equal in their criticism. If no adjective was linked to their race/ethnic background, don't apologize for an evaluation of the ASUW candidates especially because the piece was created in an open form and collaborative and involved many section editors. These endorsements were grounded in general opinions and attitudes. 

Is this really worth our time to gripe about, this circle jerk of apologies? Slippery slope my boundless boys. The Free Press (ie The Daily) has to operate on a minimum requirement of opinions independent of government (ie ASUW) and not to be bullied in changing its open-sourced opinions by an institution that disagrees.
--------------------------------------------------
Response from The Daily
(I am just copying and pasting the email I received, I am in no way connected to The Daily)
Hello Huskies,

I am writing to you with an apology for the impact that some of our recently published pieces have had on the UW community. We are sorry, and I want to share with you how we have been responding to your feedback. I also invite you to share any additional thoughts you have with me; my email address is located at the bottom of this letter.

On Monday, we published our endorsements for the 2021 ASUW Board of Directors candidates; on this same day, we also published a cartoon entitled “ASUW write-in suggestions” that attempted to caricature the uncontested elections process by suggesting that student voters write in random campus icons on their ballots. The cartoon was rightfully criticized as playing into the entrenched history of associating people of color with animals, especially given that the current ticket of ASUW candidates is majority BIPoC. To be clear, the cartoon was not meant to imply that the current slate of candidates was somehow equivalent to any of these “write-in suggestions,” but it was a poor choice nonetheless, and an oversight on my part to not recognize those connotations prior to publishing it.

Right away, we removed the cartoon from our website and issued a statement explaining our rationale for the removal. After this, we began receiving additional feedback that there was language in our endorsements piece that played into racist tropes as well. We agree. Even though we don't believe we saw the candidates at their best, “lazy” and “unprepared” should not have been used to describe them. As of the publication of this letter, the endorsements have been removed from our website in acknowledgment of this. This was a decision we reached as a team Tuesday night, and the action of removing the endorsements was postponed until we could substantially and publicly address the concerns. We understand the negative impacts of leaving the endorsements posted, but did not want to retract them silently. I cannot stand by published content that harms marginalized groups. 

Our stance as section editors in regard to the ASUW elections has not changed — we believe that voters, the students, deserve a robust slate of candidates to choose from, and that this year’s election process has been confusing and underwhelming (hence our decision to not endorse). But this was not the fault of the candidates themselves. Our critiques were based solely on observations gathered from attending the elections forums held the week of April 19 and from each candidate’s official platform webpage, and we didn’t see the full picture of how this year’s election cycle has come together. 

For added context, the process by which we come to publish our annual endorsements is open form and collaborative and involves many of our section editors. Our endorsements are grounded in the general opinions and attitudes of our signatory section editors, along with our understanding of the issues and the candidates. The actual writing of the endorsements is subject to edits and ultimate approval by these section editors, the Managing Editor, and the Editor-in-Chief.

These two pieces (the cartoon and the endorsements) were separate, and helmed by different people, but they have understandably been conflated as they were published on the same day. Both pieces were approved by me as Editor-in-Chief; thus, I take ownership over the impact that they have had. I’m sorry. Here is what we are doing in response:
 

Immediately establishing a space for and coalition of BIPoC Daily contributors to openly share their unique experiences and inform future reform efforts at The Daily.

Beginning to track retention and career progression to specifically identify where staff, especially marginalized staff, are being held back.

Establishing clear and specific plans to actively recruit diverse talent, working with RSOs and campus organizations to reach students historically underrepresented in The Daily's editorial staff.

Redesigning the process through which we conduct our endorsements for next year, which is clearly no longer serving our community. While we can’t prescribe processes for future Daily leadership, we can strongly encourage a return to hosting our own forum, among other changes. 

Reaching out individually to student groups affected to discuss making amends and how we can work together to improve the UW community.

Implementing a regular survey to get input on The Daily’s performance from both an internal and external perspective, which will be integrated into leadership strategies.

Finally, I want to take this opportunity to clarify our position and stake in these issues that impact all of campus. The Daily is not affiliated with, nor funded by, the UW administration or any academic department. We are an independent, student-run organization; all the content we publish is generated, illustrated, photographed, edited, and posted by students. Because we are students ourselves, and because we are partly funded by the Services and Activities Fee (SAF), which all UW students pay into, it is our mission to fairly and respectfully represent the concerns of students. Sometimes this means taking bold, critical stances — our endorsements are always controversial for this reason — but I’ve come to realize that this year is different, and I regret the tone of the critiques. 

Being a student leader is challenging at any time, but especially during a pandemic. Nothing is as easy or as coordinated as it should be, and it isn’t the fault of any individual but the result of us all trying to navigate unprecedented circumstances and experiencing countless related traumas. The grace and understanding I am asking for, in penning this letter, is also what I should have explicitly extended to our ASUW candidates in the process of editing the endorsements. The relationship between press and government, even on a student level, is often (and necessarily) adversarial, but it should always be thoughtful and intentional.

I hope to continue to do good work that makes our community proud through the end of this year, and when I pass this desk off to next year’s Editor-in-Chief in June, to work with them to implement the lessons I have learned from this experience and to continue building on our action items. 

Thank you for all the feedback and engagement that has led to these discussions and plans on our end. I deeply appreciate your willingness to stand up for what is right and to point out where we have fallen short. I am sorry. I, and The Daily, will do better.

Voting in the ASUW Board of Directors election begins Monday, May 3 at 12:01 a.m. and ends Wednesday, May 5 at 11:45 p.m. More information on the election can be found at this link;  information on the candidates can be found here.

 
Sincerely,
 

Editor-in-Chief Mac Murray

Prepackaged tofu meals at district market?
Hi all - this is probably a long shot but 
I haven’t been on campus for a while but when I was there I used to eat those prepackaged/refrigerated tofu in spicy sauce things from district market/hub all the time (don’t judge me oof). I don’t really like most tofu but liked this a lot and wanted to try to make something similar but have no idea where to start.

Anyone know if there’s a restaurant or store that UW gets those from or what type of tofu they use/how they make it that texture?

What is the business llc ?
Hey! I’m an incoming freshman at UDub this fall and am a DA to foster. I wanted to know what a business llc is. What does it consist of and is it worth being a part of? 
The only reason I am considering north campus(McCarty) is because of the llc. I’ve found plenty of people and a few potential roommates who want to live in west campus but I don’t want to sacrifice my education for it. 

So should I choose it over going to west campus ?

Architecture Minor
Hey! Sorry to distract from the ASUW/Daily topic. Posting rn because I will forget to otherwise lol.

*Anyways, anyone here currently doing a minor in architecture? How much do your ARCH classes cover materials and/or sustainable building topics?* I read that the ARCH program has somewhat of a focus on that, but was curious how much of that you can realistically cover while taking the ARCH minor.

I am considering going into sustainable architecture w/ a focus on materials (planning to major in MSE or ChemE w/ nanoscience) and possibly getting an MArch degree later. Some exposure would be good!

Does UW have an alumni recommendation letter?
I'm currently a UW student, and one of the students who are going to graduate from high school where I graduated trying to apply to UW this year. 

Can I write a recommendation letter to the student as an alumnus of that high school to help the student to get into UW?
--------------------------------------------------
The Daily should not have removed the cartoon and apologized.
The moment they apologized and removed the cartoon is literally letting ASUW gaslight them into admitting that their cartoon was actually racially based, which is not. ASUW is projecting a lot of their own racist views here and it's quite hilariously sad.   
A perfect example that relates to this situation is a very famous YouTuber called NigaHiga (pronounced Nee-ga-Hee-ga). For the longest time, people called him out to change his youtube name because they thought it was hatefully/racially motivated. However, he never changed it because he said if he did change it, it would mean that his name was meant to be racist.  


ASUW has no idea how badly they are bringing down UW's reputation and needs to take accountability for their dumb actions. As the decision-makers and representatives of our school, you guys need to do better.

Neuroscience major?
Hey y’all, I’m thinking of taking the pre law route. Would a neuroscience major be ok for that. It looks like uw doesn’t have a behavioral neuroscience undergrad program. Is NS the study of behavior on all levels or is this just for pre Med majors and about curing disease?

The ASUW-Daily spat - more than you think. Recall Camille Hattwig
The other posts on this are missing the bigger picture - ASUW president Camille Hattwig used the allegations of racism to draw attention away from The Daily's reporting on her nearly fraudulent election practices.

Here's how it down in the context of the election:

1. ASUW doesn't advertise deadlines or other info for the upcoming election so it consists entirely of ASUW insiders running unopposed
2. The Daily calls them out for this
3. Camille fabricates allegations of racism against the Daily to try to delegitimize their very reasonable concerns about the election. In her (somewhat alarmist) email to the entire student body about this, she leaves out any specifics because then people would see that her claims are ridiculous.

I know ASUW is kinda a joke, but it's entirely inappropriate for an elected incumbent to try to delegitimize reasonable criticism from the press about an election. And something really did go wrong with this election - 100% of positions consisting of unopposed insiders shows they used unfair pre-election processes.

Camille should be recalled for this - if any of you know how to get that started we should work on that.

EDIT: petition to call a recall election is here [https://forms.gle/VtNAvATYz9xahP7A9](https://forms.gle/VtNAvATYz9xahP7A9). You have to be signed in with your UW google account.

Has anyone heard back from the psych department major admissions yet?
They said they’d email us in the 5th week and the waiting is giving me some crazy anxiety sickness. Does anyone know if they notify everyone at the same time, or if they roll them out gradually over the 5th week?
--------------------------------------------------
[Opinionated Overview] The whole beef between the ASUW and The Daily is so incredibly messed up and it makes me so angry.
**UPDATE:** I have posted a follow-up thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/n1e3kz/a_followup_on_my_opinionated_overview_and_how_you/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that includes detailed instructions on submitting complaints and a petition to resolve problems surrounding the sending of the email.

[The cartoon in question](https://preview.redd.it/yvd4q5t2ozv61.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=a90dfd1f3c40f2ead992a6a457b65913ace3b830)

So I, like many of you received an email from ASUW (from which I am not subscribed to any newsletter) about racist imagery targeting certain UW students. My first thought was that it was probably some right-wing cartoonist who posted a problematic opinion piece that crossed the line, but I couldn't find it because it seemed to have already been removed. You can see it above here. The general consensus amongst students who have problems with this is essentially that this cartoon compares the majority BIPOC candidates to animals (along with a food truck and public art piece).

Before I move on and explain why I don't think this is a comparison or racist at all, let me give you the context for the cartoon that the mass-sent email left out. The Daily is a student-run newspaper that always posts their candidate endorsements for the ASUW elections, which is UW's student government. This year however, likely due to Covid-19 and people not being as involved and on-campus, the tickets for the major races stand completely uncontested with one unofficial opposition ticket. The Daily this year decided to not endorse any of the candidates, specifically stating that "This year, The Daily has decided not to endorse any of the candidates,  all of whom are qualified for their respective positions but, based on  their performance, are clearly not prepared." I *highly* encourage you to read the full endorsement article, which can found [here](https://www.dailyuw.com/opinion/article_98fe0652-a645-11eb-8917-a7c8c54dae46.html). You will find that while the writers have both positive and negative opinions on each candidate, they still choose not to endorse any.

Now here is where the cartoon comes in: since all of the elections are uncontested, the article pokes fun at this fact by suggesting write-in candidates consisting of iconic UW imagery. Any student who has been on campus and many who have not had the chance will be able to recognize these "candidates" as staples of the UW's campus culture and jokes pertaining to them have been common for as long as they have existed. Now, the medicinal herb garden monkey seems to be the animal people are most upset about, and it does not help that it is one of the more niche UW icons. If you are unaware of the monkey, you can read about it's history and see pictures of it [here](https://magazine.washington.edu/monkey-business-the-story-of-the-uw-medicinal-herb-garden-and-its-guardians). Considering all of this information and context, I am hard-pressing in seeing the angle that many critics are presenting that the candidates are being "compared" in any way to these animals which only make up a portion of the suggestions.

Ultimately, The Daily removed this cartoon from their publication and issued an open-letter apology to the ASUW. If this is where the controversy ended, I would move on and not make this post but I am sure most of you reading this are aware of the email that was just sent to all UW students from the ASUW.

Today, the ASUW president issued an email to all UW students under the subject "ASUW Response to the 04/26 Post from The Daily" which claimed, without any context provided, that The Daily had published "racist imagery from The Daily surrounding the current ASUW elections". I, like many of you, went to the subreddit and my friends in both The Daily staff and the ASUW to see what had happened and after which found a cartoon that was blown significantly out of proportion by the ASUW.

I am extremely disappointed that the ASUW leadership would abuse their power to email every UW student, regardless of subscription status, to paint The Daily as racist out of nowhere to the entire student body over a few student's perception of one cartoon from one artist. The Daily is a student-run organization that staffs many POC's and has always supported progressive student movements, protests, and actions. It is completely unfair for them to have someone with the power to email every student claim that they published racist imagery after the cartoon was removed and people can't even see the what was posted anymore. How is The Daily even supposed to defend themselves if the narrative can be so easily controlled by one side? The calls for The Daily to "do better" than the apology by donating from their already limited budget to things like mutual aid is outrageous and completely unnecessary. I saw one student say that "y'all gotta pay reparations anyway" so the POC staff for The Daily better open up their wallets, I guess.

There needs to be consequences for whoever approved this abusive and manipulative email to be sent to the entire student body like this. All it has done is put the safety of The Daily staff in jeopardy and given fuel for right-wing pundits to use to indoctrinate even more people who have an irrational fear of cancel culture. However, I for one do not want to wait for action to be taken and call for people to write in "Dubs I" for every position to show that we are not okay with this kind of behavior from those who are supposed to protect and lift up our student organizations who fight for just causes, especially the press which highlights many civil rights and social justice issues facing the students in our school.

&#x200B;

TLDR: The ASUW president sent an email to every UW student out of nowhere and with no context claiming that The Daily is racist over a cartoon that was no longer publicly available, unfairly controlling the narrative of the situation and putting the safety of the publicly listed staff of The Daily in jeopardy.

&#x200B;

**PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do NOT personally harass, attack, or threaten any members of the ASUW or staff of The Daily regardless of your position. Keep discussions civil and respectful of other people's views and experiences**

Response letter sent to Staffs of the Daily from the Editor
Message is below

“Hello everyone,

I am writing to you to offer some clarity on a situation that has unfolded over Instagram over the past few days in response to posting our ASUW endorsements and an unrelated cartoon. Both these pieces, while published separately, received criticism for perpetuating racist expectations of and associations with the ASUW ticket, who are majority POC. You have probably seen the fallout and criticism, and I apologize for not getting a message out to the entirety of staff sooner -- yesterday was spent in meetings with our publisher and the editorial team as we solidified next steps to take as a paper. 

We've spent the last few days reckoning with this and designing actions that can hopefully repair relations and trust between us and other organizations on campus and, more importantly, solidify our commitment to justice. Here are some action steps we have agreed on and will be implementing over the course of the next few days:

Rescinding the endorsements -- not the substance, but the tone and language, especially. We will be removing the entire endorsements article from our site and social media.

I will be posting a Letter from the Editor, which I have been working on this morning, explaining the rationale behind removing the endorsements and demystifying the conversations that have been taking place on my end. Depending on how things work out with a few other breaking news stories, our intent is to send out this Letter from the Editor to the entire newsletter mailing list in place of tomorrow's standard planned newsletter. This is to ensure that the letter reaches everyone who was originally reached by the cartoon and endorsements.

We had a productive staff meeting last night discussing ways we can make sure that there is greater BIPOC editorial influence in all pieces we publish, and how we can reform our endorsements process for the future to avoid perpetuating this harm. We will not be making any more endorsements as a publication until our process is refined.

I am also independently reaching out to the leaders of student organizations who were impacted and offering a personal apology, as well as an offer to have a conversation via Zoom if anyone is open to that and feels that it would be beneficial.

There are a few things I want to say to you all in this all-staff communique. 

First, as a human, I am deeply sorry for the harm caused by the publication of these pieces. I understand that this underscores the necessity for radical change in how we approach processes like the endorsements and the editorial approval of cartoons, and I want you to be assured that the leadership team has been grappling with these issues intensively and emotionally over the past few days.

Second, as a leader, I am sorry if my actions in approving these pieces for publication have eroded your trust in me or in the organization as a whole. The Daily's overriding commitment is to justice and to speaking truth to power, and I recognize that we harmed our reputation in this regard. I also recognize that there will need to be a rebuilding of trust between all parties, and for this reason I'm happy to speak personally with anyone who has questions about the process of publishing these pieces or our response, for the sake of transparency. As writers and contributors, you are The Daily, much more than I am, and I'm committed to spending my final months in this job working to make this a more equitable space.

Third, in light of the need for reflection and making amends, we are taking the day off production today (Wednesday) and resuming normal work tomorrow after the publication of my Letter from the Editor. I believe there is still good, important work to be done this year and I hope to be able to continue to pursue that alongside you all.

If there is anything further you would like to discuss with me, or any questions I can answer, my inbox is open. Thank you, and I hope you are taking care.”

The ASUW-Daily Beef Summarized
The ASUW board elections are coming up soon, so the Daily released their usual election coverage article on which candidates they believe are most qualified. The problem is, there is only one ticket and one candidate for each position. The daily believed that the candidates were unprepared for their roles in ASUW and decided not to endorse any candidates. Here's the article: [https://www.dailyuw.com/opinion/article\_98fe0652-a645-11eb-8917-a7c8c54dae46.html](https://www.dailyuw.com/opinion/article_98fe0652-a645-11eb-8917-a7c8c54dae46.html)

This article also originally contained the following cartoon. After complaints about racism due to comparing candidates to animals (especially the medicine garden monkey), the Daily apologized and withdrew the cartoon: [https://ibb.co/XXhMBNh](https://ibb.co/XXhMBNh)

UpliftUW, the ticket with every candidate made this post to respond: [https://www.instagram.com/p/COKJAzNgQoy/](https://www.instagram.com/p/COKJAzNgQoy/)

Then we all got his email from ASUW this morning: [https://preview.redd.it/z3gnos4hezv61.png?width=1166&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b22149fa68287c45a86302f0f0833366a9a6e3e](https://preview.redd.it/z3gnos4hezv61.png?width=1166&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b22149fa68287c45a86302f0f0833366a9a6e3e)

The article never should have had that monkey drawing, but the criticisms from the Daily are valid and shouldn't be ignored because of that.

How should I use this credit if I end up scoring well this year?

An Open Letter to Fellow CS Rejects
I would like to start this post off by saying that for all those who have had to experience getting rejected from your desired major at UW, I understand your pain as I was in your shoes just two years ago. Because I have lived through that struggle of being reject from CS I’d like to offer some words of encouragement to those of you that are currently going through that process. I remember being crushed by my second rejection letter from the CS department as I realized it meant that the program that I had dreamed about being admitted to was not going be an option. I hope that everyone who reads this realizes that a rejection letter alone is not an indictment on your capabilities, and that there are so many other options out there for you.

When I was unable to get into the CS department I made to the hard decision to transfer from UW to pursue CS degree elsewhere, and looking back two years later I am so glad that I made this decision. Since transferring I have been able to pursue a degree in the field I truly wanted, complete a senior capstone project for NASA, and have a job lined up at a Fortune 500 company this fall after I graduate. While this is not the plan I originally had for college when I graduated high school, I could not be happier with the way that things have turned out.

So for those who have had a similar experience to me at UW, I encourage you to really consider all the different options that you have. If anybody has questions about the transfer process feel free to reach out as I would happy to share what I have learned.

Finally got my 2nd Covid Vaccine
God this makes me so excited, I can finally start doing stuff at UW in two weeks (masked around other ofc). It makes me feel hopeful about having a somewhat normal summer and fall quarter at UW where I can actually live like a normal student.

Renting a laptop for a quarter from the stf?
Is it possible to rent a laptop for the duration of the quarter. If so, what are the rules and such.
--------------------------------------------------
Class timings and travel time
I was looking into the feasability of walking around campus from class to class. I have back to back classes which was 8 mins away walking. Is it fair to assume that the first class will end on time, or do profs tend to go over time? (For context, these classes are CSE 374 and POL S 203).

BASW foreign language requirement
Hey, 
So I applied to transfer into UW’s school of social work and someone from admissions emailed me asking me about the foreign language requirement. I thought I did it in high school but it looks like it wasn’t enough to meet the requirement and I wont have time to be able to get it done before fall quarter. Has anyone gone through this? Im pretty upset that I overlooked that requirement. Has anyone accepted even though they didn’t have their foreign language requirement finished?

Strongly Do Not Recommend Nordheim
Recently, the construction directly adjacent to Nordheim is getting unbearable. I'm sure nobody likes to attend classes or study with the deafening construction noises. I can't even hear myself think at times.
From Monday to Friday, 7 am to 5 pm. The nonstop noises are making me pretty agitated.

I just want everyone who's coming to Nordheim to prepare yourselves. It's gonna be like this for, give or take, another year.

Cheap or big portion restaurants near UW?
Sick of overpriced food in Seattle. Here’s my personal list of cheap places for the amount of food you get (microwave reheat value factored in) help me add to it please. Wanna help all the hungry students out there!

The GOATS 
- BB Grill
- Chipotle (bowl + 2 side tortillas) 
- Hiroshi’s (INSANE quality and surprisingly very good next day ) 
- Chili’s Indian Cuisine (lunch buffet)
- Uwajiyama (it’s far if u don’t have car tho :( roast chicken combo is delicious and like 7.99 😩)
- Korean Tofu House (banchan ftw) 
- Banh Mi in general 
- Snowy Village (Mango Bing Soo AMAZING💦)
- Thai Tom Thai Iced Coffee (hella tasty and $3.25)

Decent Value 
- Memo’s (Husky Burrito / tacos are decent) 
- Most Greek / Thai places (kinda cheap but not that big of portions) 
- itadakimasu 
- U:Don
- Cafe on the Ave (kimchi fried rice only!)
- Big Tuna (Terriyaki/sushi combo) 

??? 
- Ku Sushi (it’s trash imo, but reviews are good?? And it’s cheap for sushi in Seattle so) 
- Hawaiian BBQ Place (I think it’s okay, but people love it) 
- Jack &amp; The Box (meh but the mobile deals)
--------------------------------------------------
If not CS, is it still worth it?
I’m an incoming freshman for the Fall of 2021. I was denied DTM acceptance into the CS program. I also looked at ACMS and Info for possible majors, but I’ve read on this thread and the website how difficult it is to also get into those majors. I just have a fear of coming to UW and being another case of the weed out problem and not get into a desired major. Since I have other strong CS schools as options, do you think I should pursue one of those?

How competitive is the PhD in Epi?

Scholarship Displacement
So basically my EFC was 11k and UW gave me about 19k in fin aid for need. I recently won a 4k scholarship but I heard UW has scholarship displacement. The thing is my family can't pay for all of the EFC so I still need the money. Will the 4k reduce my award package and keep the EFC the same? I've emailed the financial aid office but I haven't gotten a response yet so any advice would be appreciated!

Residence halls housing contract is by academic year only?
As per this page: https://hfs.uw.edu/Housing-Agreements/Rates

Where do we find prices for the full year?

What are the humanities?
What are the humanities? What do humanists do? The Four Pillars of Humanities First guide how we present and discuss these questions!

1. We study aspects, questions, and problems of human societies, communications, and cultures

2. We approach our questions through lenses of languages, materials, and histories

3. Our approach is critical and speculative rather than empirical, and subjective rather than objective

4. We focus on finding meaningful questions rather than providing definitive answers

These Four Pillars have helped us establish our goals for Humanities First this year!

Should I go to UW?
As the final days count down before the deadline to accept my admission offer for the fall, I can't decide where to go to college. UW is one of my top choices for many reasons, but I thought I'd write to ask about some downsides of UW. If anyone who currently attends UW as an undergrad could reply with some insight, that would help me so much.

Thank you!

Parking as a commuter?
Hello! I’m going to be a sophomore this fall so it’s my first time on campus. However, I plan on commuting. I want to take my own car and I know the parking pass is quite pricey.

Are there certain times that I should show up so I can secure a spot?

psych major application
i know that it has been said that it is more challenging to apply during the summer quarter because only 3.9-4.0 students are accepted, but if there are no applications happening this summer for fall quarter, does that mean those of us who applied during this quarter (spring) are going to be split up for summer and fall? i'm just a bit confused on this application process.

freshman registering for courses
hey everyone, i'm an incoming freshman this fall and was kinda stressing over classes. i'm transferring about 100 credits in and  planning to start the orgo series. I'm not able to register until late june or even later so i'm worried if there's even going to be any spots available. i was kind of banking on orgo bc all my other classes only have 1 section so i'd have to change around my plans. so, my question is, how likely am I to get a spot on my first/second choice sections? is there a lot of competition?

i'd appreciate any help or advice at all! thanks.

edit: i'm looking at 8:30's if that helps

Short questions about housing app and 3-person dorms/suites
Are you able to request more than one roommate for dorms? I'm working out housing plans with two people I know and we weren't sure, the UW website seems to insinuate that you can only request one other person, but I can't find a for sure answer. Also, is getting a suite even possible? (We are looking at North Campus) They seem super limited and are probably already taken by people who got priority because of COVID last year, right? Can we select a suite as first choice and a 3 person as second choice?

edit: also do any dorms have toilets with exposed water lines so I can put a bidet in lmao

Can I take classes from other sub-colleges at UW?
Hello, 

I’m a prospective student and I recently got admitted as pre-major into the College of Arts and Science. While that definitely has some cool classes to look forward to, I also have quite the interest in a lot of the classes in Fosters or the CSE classes. 

I’m wondering, if I wanted to take say, CSE 344 (Introduction to Data Management) as a non-major, can I do that? I wouldn’t really want to take the 100-level ones as I already learned them. 

If I can take other classes, is there a limit on how many?


Side question: Some of the prereqs for programming classes I already know but I don’t have any AP credit, is there any way to remove the requirement so I wouldn’t have to take the normal CSE 143 prereq if I wanted to get into CSE 344? It would be just a repeat of my high school programming class.

Phew! Sorry for the wall of text, thank you for any help!

S/NS Education Grad school
I am currently a freshman (sophomore standing) and hoping to major in Education, Communities, and Organizations. My future plans is to major in ECO and minor or double major in mathematics: teacher prep then go to grad school to get a teaching degree. So I finished math 125 & 126 with 3.7 GPA, but currently struggling with math 307. The course is theoretical and the practice exam given today is insanely hard, so I do not think I can pass this class with a 3.7+ gpa. Should I just try to get a 3.0 or above or S/NS?

What does a typical Pre-sciences/major student schedule look like?

Meals at UW
I am going to be a freshman at UW next year, and freshman applications for housing open soon. I noticed that we need to specify how much money we want to put on our card for meals, but I couldn’t find much information about food on campus.
More specifically, what are some of the best places to get food from, and what are their prices like? How much money per quarter should I put on my card?
Is there anything online that shows their prices?
Is it even a good idea to mainly rely on campus locations for food?

Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

Feeling sad and discouraged on the udub waitlist :(
I’m an OOS student who relocated to Seattle recently and I was really really wanting to get in but *sigh* I got waitlisted. I’m looking to do premed (and please don’t tell me about how much udub sucks with selective majors, weighted grades, etc. I already know and am anxious about it.) Basically I’m just reaching out to other ‘waitlisters’ to see if y’all are as anxious and scared as I am. I know I would kick ass if I got the opportunity to go and it’s so discouraging to think that the admissions people don’t feel the same way. Was I a perfect applicant? No. I graduated in 2018 and worked for 3 years because I had no freakin clue what I wanted to do or where I wanted to go. Finding udub, applying, moving to Seattle, it all just felt so right. I’m so close to having everything I want and I very well might not get in. I didn’t apply anywhere else (stupid choice but whatevs). This just feels like the right place for me. I’m fr panicking. Like anxiety attacks and crying and reading through every post on this page about admissions a million times. I’m just trying to will my acceptance into existence. I want to appeal but I don’t even know what I would say. Guys... I’m stressed.

MFA in Creative Writing at UW Bothell
Hey all,

I'm an international student looking to do an MFA in Creative Writing at UW Bothell. I would describe my GPA as average but my writing samples are strong (I hope I don't come across as a know-it-all, I just like my writing!) I was wondering if anyone here has any experience with the program and if so, what your recommendations would be. Also, as an international student, aside from scholarships I, unfortunately, need to apply for private loans. I've read there are a number of on-campus job opportunities for students, but I was wondering if that was legit.

Thank you in advance for all the answers and help!

Reminder: Be cautious with certain emails in your @uw.edu inbox
Just a reminder, especially for incoming and current freshman, please be cautious and mindful with certain emails, received from legitimate-looking UW email accounts, inclusive of career opportunities mentioning dollar amounts. These are scam emails attempting to phish for information from students. UW "HR" and department faculty will not reach out to students specifically with dollar amounts or career opportunities in emails like this.

Remember COVID still isn’t over
I was on campus the other day and half of y’all weren’t wearing masks.

Because it seems like not everyone knows: 
• You’re not immune to SARS-CoV-2 because you got vaccinated 
• You can still shed the virus if you’re still vaccinated 
• You shed DAYS BEFORE you develop symptoms and you’re at your most infectious during this time 
• Others are still not vaccinated and some cannot get vaccinated 
• Masks work to prevent spread to those around you and they don’t work if you have your nose out. 

All in all, remember to distance and mask up. These preventative measures protect no only yourself, but everyone else and that’s exactly why we have to keep doing them.

Edit: wow what have I started. 

I’ve looked at some of comments and thank you to those of you for giving constructive criticism based on institutional guidelines and academic literature. I probably won’t bother to comment directly, like most us right now, I’m busy with exams.

Questions about my major and college
Hey everyone, I was admitted as “Engineering Undecided in the College of Engineering” for fall 2021. (I applied for civil engineering). Freshman applicant.
- Will I still have to apply for my major after my first year or am I able to just pick one with no application? 
- Did I dodge the weed-out classes as a DTC admit or are they present all 4 years?
- Do people keep their cars on campus? I’ve heard its risky cause they might get pretty beat up.

Thank you so much!! Im excited to see you all on campus this fall!

Should I go to UW?
Hi everyone, I was recently admitted to UW’s class of 2025 and am currently deciding between UW and Emory. For context, I’m an international student and am drawn to UW due to its vast internship and employment opportunities compared to Emory, however, I also intend to major in ACMS/AMath/Statistics and the way the competitive nature of those majors is described on this subreddit scares me. I’m not sure whether I should risk not getting my intended major and commit to UW or go to Emory, where I’m guaranteed my major. It would be great if y’all could help. Thanks a lot!!

Bicycle safety in McMahon
The only place where McMahon people can lock their cycles is on the "Front exterior bike railing" according to the HFS website: [https://hfs.uw.edu/Live/Undergraduate-Housing-Rates-and-Information/McMahon-Hall](https://hfs.uw.edu/Live/Undergraduate-Housing-Rates-and-Information/McMahon-Hall)

Since this railing is outside of the building, isn't it more prone to theft and adverse weather conditions compared to other dorms? All the other North Campus dorms have storage areas inside the bldg.

How do McMahon people manage to lock their cycles?

What’s with all the Californians committing to UW?
I just looked at the unofficial uw class of 2025 page on Instagram and there seemed to be quite a large number of incoming students from California.

California has a large population and it’s rather close by so it’s not outrageously unexpected or anything, but given how many great universities California has makes me curious about why so many people are coming here.

Anyone have any ideas why?

gpa frustration
i’m graduating in June and i am happy with my GPA. it’s above a 3.5 which is good enough for me and i think is good by a lot of people’s standards. now that i’m graduating i see a lot of my friends who went to private colleges or colleges that just aren’t as competitive get these crazy high honors for having good GPAs. not to say that they don’t work hard, but my impression is that it’s easier to get a good GPA when you’re not pitted against your classmates🙄 it’s just really frustrating to me because i worked really hard for my GPA but just got screwed by weed out classes at the beginning and now i’m stuck. i don’t have any plans of going to grad school so it’s not even like it will affect me that much in the future but i’m definitely feeling subpar. 

with that being said though, there is so much more to you than your GPA so don’t let my post bring you down. these are just my thoughts as i scroll through my linkedin feed. thanks for reading :)

i'm really interested in going to UW, but i'm worried about the climate/weather in washington. i have a lot of chronic health issues and cold, wet, rainy weather causes awful flare ups for me. it also just makes me feel depressed and unmotivated. i live on the east coast, so i dont know if washington is really as cold and rainy as people say it is. so my question is: is washington as wet and dreary as people make it out to be? and does that have a serious impact on the students at UW? sorry if this doesnt make much sense. 😓

is there still hope in bringing your GPA up if you’ve done kinda badly your freshman year 😅
so long story short....i’ve always had a procrastination habit. in high school i somehow still got a 4.0 unweighted cumulative gpa without studying and procrastinating on literally everything. i learned this year (my freshman year) that this does NOT work in college. My gpa suffered a lot this year just because not studying and winging tests just doesn’t work in college like it did for me in HS. I’ve learned a lot about my own study habits and how to stop procrastinating but I’m kinda worried that it’ll be hard to raise my grades...anyone have any advice/ can share their experience?

Hansee 3 person suite vs McMahon Double Room + General North Campus advice
Hello! 
Incoming freshman here. 
I'm considering North Campus Dorms...

Out of the 6 dorms, 4 are extremely similar in pricing and dorm layout... and I'm not too sure about these 4 cuz a 4 person or 3 person suite I feel is pretty small and not worth it??? The doubles and singles here are just outta my reach :(

*I'M NOT STRIKING OF THESE 4 OPTIONS, STILL CONSIDERING THEM*

So the remaining two are Hansee and McMahon.

♤ In Hansee, I'm considering a 3 person suite which is 6k per year. I just want to know your opinions. 

I've heard Hansee is very quiet and everyone is not that social??? But a 3 person suite will be more social I think?
Do many freshmen live in Hansee?

Also it has a bicycle storage room (unlike McMahon) inside which is a big plus for me. I plan to get a cycle to go to class as well as for recreation.

♤ In McMahon, I'm looking at the double room which is 7k per year.

I've heard McMahon is very social due to the cluster system. Do many freshmen live in McMahon?

There is no cycle storage... we have to keep it outside the bldg on the rails... very likely to be stolen.

☆☆☆ The thing is I like quiet environments to some extent, where I can focus on academics... not extremely noisy and stuff.
Hansee and McMahon seem to be on two extreme ends. I believe some sociability is important which a 3 or 4 person suite in Hansee will facilitate???☆☆☆

I'm sorry for the long post but it would be very helpful if you can drop me your opinions. 

Should I choose Hansee, McMahon or any of the remaining four dorms?

The Daily wants to know: what will your summer look like?
Hi!

My name is Zoe, and I write for the Daily of the University of Washington. I'm writing an Opinion section article about what UW students are planning to do over the summer once they are vaccinated, since all adults are now eligible to get the vaccine. This piece won't be about bashing anyone's choices -- it's meant to be more of a fun piece about how college students plan to re-enter the world this summer. Are you still nervous, or are you totally prepared to go out and about? Are your going to dive into the dating game, or are you going to lean more towards reconnecting with people you haven't seen for awhile? Basically, what fun and exciting plans do you have for the upcoming summer break? If you have any thoughts on the topic, I'd love to hear them!

Should I Go to UW?
Hey! I'm an incoming freshman trying to decide between UW and UCLA. I'm instate in Washington, for background and I want to be premed (I've been set on this my whole life). Right now my heart is set on UCLA, but I can't justify the cost difference. I'm planning on being an RA by my sophomore year at UCLA, making the total price around $43,000 a year vs. UW instate prices (which I could get down to $12000 a year). Because I'm super outgoing and I was my class president, I fit the RA type pretty well so I could probably get that at UW too. Being a stem major (I would major in Biology at UW), hearing the competitive major stuff is super scary. I'm extremely motivated and always willing to do the work, but I heard that even doing that doesn't guarantee your major at UW. My dream major is at UCLA (the interdisciplinary Human Bio and Society) and UW only has regular biology. I didn’t get into honors at UW, but if I went to UCLA I would aim for honors. I want to meet new people and definitely not be tied down to my high school friends, and I thrive in a positive environment where people are chill but hardworking and helpful. My dream is NYU or Harvard Med.  My family is well off enough to afford both, the only difference is that at UW they would be able to help with med school costs and UCLA they wouldn't be. I can get instate tuition at UCLA during the summer so I can take advantage of those to reduce the price. I want to be able to get a 3.9 by the end of college. Please help me decide!

In-network dentist for international students

--------------------------------------------------
Running Start?
My school offers either IB or RS (AP isn't very strong here). I'm aware of the compromises of not having my hand held as much in college, but I believe it's a better fit for me. Objectively, It seems RS would benefit me more than IB though I'm still contemplating. I've consulted educators and councilors on this topic but I'm still unsure. 

The colleges I'm looking at for RS are North Seattle College and Bellevue College. I have a ride to Bellevue but I'd have to pay the toll and parking fees compared to just taking the metro to North Seattle College. 30-40 minutes metro vs possibly an hour via car to Bellevue. More study time vs a possibly better education at Bellevue. 

I previously wanted to major in Aerospace or similar. I've been told with my current progression in math and science that it would be virtually impossible to get even admitted into the program. Bio and Alg 2 as a sophomore, took Phys/Chem and Geometry freshmen year. I've heard of direct transfer agreements and such but I've also been told it would be rare for me to get one. 

I feel like blaming someone for this situation, but the more I ponder the more I realize it's really more than just a few things. I've only ever gotten a "B" in 6th grade, all "A"s since then. I heard about programs like HCC very late. My mom says the school system failed me, failing to challenge me and provide me opportunities. I believe I was just being ignorant. 

I don't post much on Reddit, but I'm here because people including my counselor are beginning to not answer me and I feel like I'm pestering them by being so indecisive.

would you go to uw if you were me?
I’m a prospective student/admitted high school senior.  I applied with Math as my first choice major and Statistics as my second choice major (currently pre-sciences). I’m also considering Applied Math. Beyond math I’m very interested in Linguistics/NLP stuff so I’d like to incorporate that into my education somehow. I’m out of state from Oregon, so UW is around $55k/yr.

Because of on the location and the huge range of classes offered, UW was my first choice ever since I got in. But after seeing that post about the average GPA for AMATH admits being a 3.9 ....... I’m not so confident that I’ll get into a major I want (Applied Math, Statistics, or Math). I’m not extremely sure what career I’m working towards—I’d love to be a research professor but that takes like 15 years so maybe it’s too early to aim for that. 

I’ve heard a lot of mixed answers about how competitive Statistics, BS Math, BA Math, and Applied Math are, but based off of whatever is currently on the website, Math has around a 50% acceptance rate, Statistics a little below 50%, and AMATH 25% (although it apparently dropped even more). I’m not sure what to make of these numbers because I don’t know how competitive/qualified the applicant pool is.

Other schools I’m considering: 

University of Oregon ($25k/yr)
 - majors are all open 
 - considering majoring in Data Science with Linguistics concentration, Math, or Math + CS.

UC San Diego ($65k/yr)
 - admitted into the Mathematics department so it looks any of the math majors are open to me including Applied Math, Pure Math, Math + CS.
- But it’s $65k per year.

If you were me .... would you pick UW?

So has anyone been in a similar situation? Any advice is appreciated T-T

Incoming Freshman Housing "Second Choice"
Anyone know how they do housing at udub? I'm an incoming freshman and I'm wondering what happens if I don't get my first choice for room type/building. I know that on the housing form you put the building you want to be in and the type of room, but if they can't put you in that exact room/building, is there any rhyme or reason to what they put you in instead? I want to be in a single room and I'm not too picky about what building as long as it isn't the 24/7 quiet hall. If they can't place me in whatever building I enter, will they try to find me a single room in another building, or will they try to find me another room in the same building?

I have a cat and the need for an off campus roommate
I know this isn't the most common place to post for this, but people keep bailing on me (one because they are allergic to cats, another because I can't do on campus, and the other because their budget changed). I swear I'm cool!

I'm a 20yr old female enviro studies/poli sci major with my cat, Frumpkin. I'm super tidy, kind, pretty cool if you ask me. I like cooking, playing videogames, shopping/thrifting, watching shows/movies, talking, doing all sorts of shit. I'm down for 1 or 2 other roommates, and my max budget is 1.1k, preferrably less. Down to room with guys, gals, nonbinary pals, and other cats because Frumpkin loves people and animals. I can write more if you want, or you can message me!

[Research] User study for an alternative Twitter app for Android
 Hi

We are a group of researchers from University of Washington, and we would like to invite you to participate in a study about how people use Twitter on mobile devices. Specifically, we want to study how different features affect your experience and sense of control when using Twitter.

\*\*\* If you use the Twitter app on your Android phone, please read on \*\*\*

Study participants will install and use an app called “Chirp,” an alternative Twitter application, for four weeks. Each week, Chirp will have different available features for you to use. We will ask you to fill out very brief surveys (a few seconds) when you use Chirp. At the end of each week, you will fill a survey about the experience using Chirp for that week. 

The compensation for the deployment study will be $120 for the four weeks in total. As we need to collect a complete cycle of the data, if you drop out or miss a survey in the middle of the study, you will only receive partial compensation. 

If you are interested in the study, please fill out the screening questionnaire at:

[https://forms.gle/gAU7Sm8xcAAeRDrc7](https://forms.gle/gAU7Sm8xcAAeRDrc7)

We will contact you soon after if you’re eligible to participate!

For more information, please email Ray at [mingrui@uw.edu](mailto:mingrui@uw.edu)

Best,

Ray

Housing Help for boundless boi
Hi! I just need some help with what housing I need to choose. I'm an incoming intl freshman (male).

▪︎I like quiet environments... not too noisy with parties and stuff...

▪︎I'm social to some extent but I really don't want it to interfere with my studies. Basically I prefer some place where I can focus on studies, academic clubs and stuff.

▪︎Also I'm coming as a CS major... would be great if housing was close to my classes

▪︎I don't mind if housing is 2 person, 3 person or whatever. I don't prefer single housing.

▪︎Communal or private bathroom, anything is fine as long as it ain't nasty lol.

▪︎As of now, I'm not considering cost as a factor. I hope to work on campus to try to cover up the cost a little.

Hope you guys can help me :)))

Anything positive about UDUB?
hey guys, this sub is honestly horrifying as an incoming freshman.  Udub has always been my dream school and this whole sub is people hating and now I'm getting second thoughts.  From the "lack of any social life outside of frats", to the copious "I hate it here" posts I honestly am terrified committing here as a non DTM applicant.  Does anyone have anything positive to share?
--------------------------------------------------
As an incoming freshman...you guys are scaring the shit out of me

When should I sign up for dorms?
I’m applying for first year housing in a few weeks and I was wondering if the time that you submit your application affects what dorm that you are assigned to? How often do people get into their first choice dorm? My first and second choices are Lander and Alder.

Also, which dorms are highest in demand?

Transferring AP credits?
I have AP credits in bio and chem, but I am not sure whether I should transfer them or not. I am planning to be on premed or predental track. And I heard many med schools does not accept AP credits for the required courses. However, I think I sort of heard about more credits gives people advantages in choosing classes. Also, bio and chem can make me avoid bio 163 and chem 142, which are two terrible weed out courses. Have anyone faced this kind of dilemma before? May I have some advices?

Credit cards
Hi guys, I’m looking to get my first credit card and I’m really overwhelmed on which cards are the best to get. I kind of late to the game being 20 years old, but I was uneducated about credit cards and credit scores. It’s never too late to start and I now wish to get one. Could you please recommend me any cards that are great for first time credit users. How long have you had yours? What are the benefits of them? Did you face any problems with them? I would really appreciate it. Thanks!

What to expect for INFO decisions?
I know INFO is really competitive and that there’s a really slim chance I’ll get in, but just out of curiosity, does anyone know the stats for this cycle (how many people applied and how many spots they have) or when we can expect decisions by? I know they said they’ll send decisions by May 7th, but do they usually send them earlier than that?

I haven’t seen a post about Foster’s spring cycle admission so I decided to make one. How’s everyone feeling? Needless to say, I’m very anxious 🥴

update: i got in!

Anyone currently or graduated from the MIT in elementary education?
I recently gained an interest in the masters in teaching program and am registered for this summer quarter for the pre reqs for the program, however I kind of missed up my sophomore year and now my cumulative gpa is about a 3.0 now as a result, the minimum to apply. I’m in my last term and am doing well and have been doing well the past year grade wise. The website says they only count the last 90 credits taken, so with that id be at about a 3.2. And if I do well this summer quarter i would be at a 3.3 at least. 

I have also about 2 years experience working with children coaching swimming and am looking for work in early childcare in the meantime. 

Are these stats realistic to get in the 2022 cohort?
--------------------------------------------------
Study abroad?
I was wondering if you could study abroad your sophomore year? Fall quarter? Or is it only available for juniors and seniors?👀

Because I really want to study abroad :’)))

Has anyone filed a deferral petition before?
While I was admitted to the UW for this fall quarter, I can't attend it right away because of my South Korean mandatory military service this year (the services lasts for 18 months). I have contacted the admissions office and got the petition form, but they said it is extremely unlikely to get the deferral permission. Can anyone who had deferral granted tell me how the process went?
--------------------------------------------------
Transferring out of UW
For anyone who has transferred/is thinking of transferring out of UW, how hard was it to get into the school of your choice?  Does a good GPA from UW (>3.8) make transferring to a non-Ivy easier, or do most universities dedicate most of their transfers to community college graduates?

Is it a waste of time to try to change majors into Engineering?
I still have no idea if I am going to get admitted into the UW or not. The two majors I have most interest in are Marine Biology and Mechanical Engineering. I have not chosen one or the other yet, and I am aware they are entirely different. I am "transferring" to the UW, but under a degree I do not intend to complete since my running start course choices were extremely stupid and poor. I have been admitted into SeattleU, but UWs Marine Biology program seems to be substantially better, and if I am honest I am not sure how being a Christian college is going to effect SeattleUs culture. At a superficial level, the campus isn't that nice either. I may be mistaken, but I think UW has more international students. I am Pakistani and find I get along with immigrants/children of immigrants better. SeattleU also are extremely expensive. 

How difficult would it be for me to change majors into Mechanical Engineering at the UW?

Two questions!
Hi guys! I have two different questions that I figured I’d ask here. First off, does anyone know why no summer classes have in person lab elements? I’m signed up for a bio lab that had its lab portion in person for spring, but for summer it’s all online. This seems strange to me given the vaccination rates so I was wondering if there was some sort of communication about it I missed.

Also, I was wondering if anyone knows when the biology department normally releases the class matrix for the upcoming year? Trying to plan out my year & be a little more sure abt it

INFO 360 Interview!
Hi everyone!

Jewish students: what's Jewish life like at UW?
I'm a grad student moving to Seattle in September, and I'm planning to stay involved with Chabad and/or Hillel. How are they and what are they like? My undergrad ones were fairly small, so I'm wondering how Shabbat dinners, services, etc. function with more Jewish students. Are there any kosher dining options on/near campus? Is there an eruv around campus/U-Village?

I'm Reform, so I plan on attending services at either Temple Beth Am or Temple De Hirsch Sinai; both are similar distances from where I'd be staying, so I was wondering which is better for university students. I'd also be interested in Congregation Beth Shalom.

Question for Biology Pre-Med Students
Did you guys use your AP Credit for AP Calc AB, AP Chem, AP Bio to waive the classes at UW? Or did you retake them either to get a good grade or because medical schools require you to?

Economics and international studies
I am currently deciding on which school to commit to and I am thinking of committing to the UW. I am interested in majoring in Econ and international studies as a double major but I am also interested in environmental sciences/studies. Are these majors competitive? Is it worth it to go to the UW? What are the pros and cons that you have seen? My other school choices are uw Bothell and Western Washington but I am leaning against western.

Graduate funding options - MSW
So I am planning on going to UWs MSW program starting in the summer. I didn't qualify for any departmental funding or federal grants so I'm left with taking out loans to cover it all. I've been searching all the databases and blogs for scholarships or assistantships. My main problem is starting too late but does anyone have any advice on finding assistantships? I'm pretty stressed about the price tag and I'm currently in Indiana so I am realizing how much cost of living will increase once I'm out there.

UW Holds Virtual Commencement for Second Year in a Row – I'm a journalism student and I'd love to hear your thoughts!
Hey graduating seniors, I'm working on a piece about those of us who have spent most of our major online and are now looking at a virtual commencement. 

* Were you looking forward to walking?
* How much of your major did you spend online and do you feel adequately prepared to get a job?
* How did you family react?

First-generation and international students are especially encouraged to chime in!

If you'd be willing to chat with me on the phone for a few minutes it would be greatly appreciated. I am working on a podcast and your voice would likely be included!

shoutout to prof Natalie Naehrig!
webassign questions are very short + she actually throws out 5-15 questions in each hw lol 

syllabus for midterms is 2-4 chapters less than dr. loveless' midterms + the questions are MUCH easier 

no class on Friday, only Monday and Wednesday

given everything is so easy the curve is kinda bad but it's easy to excel cuz of the same reasons, so as long as you don't slack, 3.7+ guaranteed

+ good explanations and everything, np at all

I was kinda :| when I couldn't get into dr. loveless' class but honestly, I like it better here lol

Incoming freshman dorms or frat?
Im an incoming freshman currently deciding on housing for next year. I know the people in dorms last year got screwed bc of Covid but it’ll most likely be worked out by the time I go for fall so anyone who was in the dorms as a freshman before covid lmk what ur experience was like. Everyone I’ve talked to says u gotta join the frats and that the frat parties and shit are hella exclusive (seems like BS so u join the frat am I right in this assumption?). Here’s my issue is I want to grind during college bc I’ll finally be able to study what I’m interested in but I’m also Tryna let loose occasionally which is why I think frats aren’t the move and the dorms are for me. Me and some friends from Highschool are looking to stay in McCarty, willow, or oak. What do y’all recommend?
--------------------------------------------------
to those of you who have gone to school at UW in person...
how were you able to manage your classes + socializing + sleep? i’m a freshman who is staying home this year so until now I’ve been able to dedicate my entire day to school work but i’m concerned that this fall I’ll have to slack off in one of those 3 areas due to lack of time.

Did y’all find that taking more than 2 stem classes took up too much of your time? That info would help me plan out my fall quarter classes haha. thanks in advance for the help guys!
--------------------------------------------------
This is fucking bullshit. When I got my accounting exam, I had two questions that weren’t filled out even though I did them. I sent out an email so the teacher can see that I filled them out when I SHARED my screen with Proctorio. This is her response:

Maple Hall vs other North halls for freshman engineering student
I heard there is an engineering LLC in the Maple hall, but I think the location of the North hall is much better than the Maple hall. 

If you were me, which one would be your choice? 

Also, which hall is close to the engineering buildings?
--------------------------------------------------
Self confidence and esteem been destroyed since I got to UW... anyone else feel this way?
I have a test tomorrow morning and I recently failed an o chem test. I’ve basically failed almost every single o chem test I had in the first series and am doing the same in this second part of the series. I was a top student all throughout my life til now, til coming to UW. Feeling sad.. Anyone else relate?
--------------------------------------------------
CFRM
I’m a freshman who wants to major in CFRM. 
For those of you who applied to the major, what were your stats like?
How high should cumulative gpa and admission requirements gpa be?
--------------------------------------------------
What are the differences in the math majors at UW?
As a possible freshman entering UW, I've been seeing a lot of posts regarding the math departments today, probably because admissions came out and oh my goodness does it look dreadful. I'm so sorry to those who didn't get in; I hope that this post doesn't cause any more pain to those who were rejected from their goals. 

With that being said, I was researching math degrees and it's so confusing. You got BA in Math, Applied Math, ACMS, and CFRM. What's the difference between all of them?

I understand how a BS in Math would be different since it *seems* like it's math in its purest form, but a math BA seems like it's math being interdisciplinary, and that seems like the whole point of Applied Math, and Applied Math is different from ACMS even though ACMS is literally applied math in different fields with computing or something? And by that logic why is there CFRM? Can't you just get a quantitative finance degree in ACMS or do like some economics related field in applied math? If ACMS is using computers to solve math problems, then isn't that applied math with computing? Why would there be different degrees? WHAT IS GOING ON!??!

I'm sorry, I know I sound naïve as hell right now, I'm just really confused. Oh, and I didn't attend the student preview sessions because I got off the waitlist. Probably explains a lot lol. Happy 4/20 everyone!
--------------------------------------------------
Engineering freshman dorm recommendation
I know of the engineering LLC in Maple but I personally like north campus a lot more. Does anyone have advice on how I should choose? Is living within ur LLC that important and will live on the north campus make things harder?
--------------------------------------------------
ENGL 265?
Has anyone taken this class with Dr. McCauley before? Or anyone taking it currently and already submitted a short assignment? I was wondering how he is with grading because the prompts are a little vague, pm me if you know!!

Informatics vs SWE
Hi all!

Informatics DA here! I have narrowed down my college choices to either UCI for SWE or UW for Informatics. I do want to be a SWE in the future, though I am open to other jobs in tech as well. Some questions I have:

1. Should I major in Informatics with a SWE concentration or UCI SWE? Which will set me up for better job prospects?
2. How much extra leg work would I have to do outside of the INFO degree to land a SWE job (besides taking some CSE non-major electives)?

Seattle is obviously a better location for recruitment opportunities as it is a tech hub and the general vibe of the school/atmosphere seems more upbeat and friendlier (especially for the informatics major).

\*SWE major at UCI seems more rigorous than INFO (required to take calculus, boolean logic & discrete structures, linear algebra, discrete math for CS, data structure & database courses, as it is closer to a CS degree) though I'm not sure how useful some of these courses are in the field? UCI does not have server or client-side development which seem like super useful courses tbh

\*Cost wise the majors seem about the same b/c I would be graduating in three years from UW as I am a DA. Even if I end up taking longer, I am thankfully in a position where my family could cover the costs.

Thanks guys :) gotta decide in 11 days and am currently panicking :):):)

**Edit: SWE at UCI is a mix between CS & Info (SWEs take CS courses for the first two years, then informatics courses for years 3 &4) so it is NOT a pure CS major :)**
--------------------------------------------------
Official Illness Policy?
Does anyone know if the university has any official rules about what professors have to do when students get sick? I have full blown mono and two professors who pretty much I insist I turn my work in on time regardless.

UW Aeronautics & Astronautics
Is Aeronautics & Astronautics in the college of engineering? 

I wonder about this because only  Aero&Astro in CoE has their own department name (William E. Boeing)

As a DTC(CoE) student, is it possible to choose an Aero & Astro major for a junior year?
--------------------------------------------------
What are some top things to see and do to help me feel part of the UW community?
I'm an incoming grad student coming from a large university in South Carolina. Based on what I've read online and on this subreddit, there seems to be a strong sense of community and culture, at least compared to my undergrad. I'm expecting some culture shock moving from a city nowhere similar to Seattle or UW. So, what are some of the top places to see and do on campus and U-Village to understand references, etc.?

Which BIOC series should I take?
Hi guys. I’m a microbiology major and I have a question about which biochem series (BIOC405 series or the BIOC 440 series) I should take next year. I’m debating if I should take the shorter series so that I can devote more time to undergraduate research and other extracurriculars. 

I took CHEM 223-224 and I didn’t enjoy it that much and found it somewhat difficult. I am interested in applying to grad school afterward and want to research physiology (possibly metabolism) of extremophiles. Any advice or insight would help, thanks a lot!

Physics 117 lab
Does anyone know any tips for the physics 114 lab 117? We are basically doing the online labs on our own with barely any support from our TAs and I’m just confused on how the grading would work since it C/NC? I’m stuck on the online labs.

Classes for biology/chemistry majors (physics and ochem)
I'm majoring in biochemistry and already have many of my prerequisites out of the way but I still have to take some physics, math, and organic chemistry classes to take the BIOC classes. How is organic chemistry 237, 238, and 239 and physics 114, 115, and 116? Were they particularly challenging? Anything I should know/be prepared for or any great professors that you would recommend for them?

Are meal plans/dining hall plans included in the cost of attendance breakdown for financial aid?
I was just wondering if the meal plans were included as a cost in the list of direct and indirect costs? I thought it would go under personal expenses, but the lowest meal plan is $991 per quarter and the personal expenses is $772 per quarter, so that doesn’t make sense.

EDIT* oh wait, does it go under room and board? 

Thanks in advance :’)

can someone please help me understand how cse 311 is graded
when y’all took it what percent corresponded to a 3.5? (i’m guessing this class is curved to around a 3.5 since i’ve heard that in major cs classes usually are)

if i’m averaging around a 90 percent in this class can i expect a 3.5?

Looking for 3 credit courses
Wondering if there’s any easy 3 credit courses out there.

Is it against the UW student conduct to do only fans?
For grad students, so I guess both the student conduct and the employee ethics? This is a serious question lol

Join the Brotherhood Initiative program
Hello incoming freshman, if you are a minority male. I strongly suggest applying to the Brotherhood Initiative which is a program that exists to support minority men at the UW succeed throughout college and even after you graduate.

Since joining last year the BI has provided me with advising, financial aid, internships interviews, and much more. 

It was a great way for me to make friends during the pandemic and has ultimately taught me how to be a better man.

If you’re interested feel free to PM me or apply at this link where you can learn more information

Handshake
This whole handshake bullshit is a major pain in the ass

UW Bothell and Seattle share a handshake, but UW Tacoma has their own, WTF!

This would be so simpler if all 3 UW campuses shared 1 common handshake for all students regardless of what campus they go to and paying a ridiculous amount of fees.
--------------------------------------------------
Bruh fuck this school
Nothing like grinding through cutthroat weedouts for 2+ years, getting a 3.7+ in everything, wasting 15+ hours/week on BS extracurriculars, spending weeks at the writing center writing, rewriting and editing personal statements, scheduling dozens of appointments with departmental advisors to discuss strategies for improving my app, all to get rejected by just about every remotely marketable major several times over and be stuck majoring in the STEM equivalent of underwater basketweaving.

What a fucking waste of time and money. Fuck UW, fuck CSE, fuck ACMS, fuck INFO, fuck HCDE, fuck ECE, and fuck Foster.

Be boundless my ass... What a fucking scam. 

The funniest thing is that after all this I somehow got into Northwestern and UMich OOS as a transfer... Their aid sucked so I can't afford them, but I busted out laughing when I heard back. The good majors at UW are legit harder to get into than a top 20.

Edit: Sorry for the rant, but I'm just salty af rn lmao. I'll be doing UF online CS next fall... See y'all out in industry.

Summer housing around Udub
Hey guys, I'll be in Seattle during Summer for my internship, so I'm looking for cheap housing around Udub. I've checked UWash FB group, but they are mostly taken or don't work for me. So I thought I'll try this subreddit. Do any of you know anyone who's subletting their housing for cheap? I'm open to living in Frat houses too. I know frat houses rent their houses during the summer, so lmk if you guys know anything about it.
--------------------------------------------------
anyone take biol 385 (evolutionary medicine and public health) with dan eisenberg?
i thought it would’ve been a fun/interesting class to take but when i checked out rate my professor, his reviews were so bad regarding his teaching/grading methods :((

i was hoping for more insight about the course (how it’s graded, how he lectures, if he’s as bad as they say lmao etc) if anyone here has ever taken it!!

For anybody who has taken 444 or 445 with Dami (not the combined summer intensive one), what is the workload like? How difficult is it to get a decent grade (\~3.5)? I'm looking for light math classes to take concurrently with my full time internship. Thank you!

I want to go but the money tho...
I'm an out-of-state high school senior that wants to attend the University of Washington for pre-med and bio considering UW is highly ranked and prestigious in that area. The only problem is that I'm going to have to pay 38k per year even after the Stafford loan. Is there any possible way to make udub even remotely affordable for a person coming from a low-income family?

Affording UDub as an international US citizen ._.
Edit: international US citizen meaning I’m a US citizen living outside of the US) 
 
So I got my package back...and even though UDub says it's a preliminary award, I have a feeling they won't be adding much to my financial aid award. I am aware that grants aren't given to majority of the nonresidential students....but I'm going to have to pay 54K per year. Is there a use in appealing to UDub? What is the possibility of them increasing my aid? Should I even attend UDub for this amount of money? My other option is UIUC (and they technically covered all of my aid with a mixture of loans and grants).

Hoping to transfer to UW for winter quarter 2022 from a WA community college, advice needed
I am currently attending community college finishing up my AA transfer degree and trying to figure out what my odds of making it are. I really slacked off in my summer 2020 quarter classes, which I am still paying the price for. Every quarter following was B's and B+'s and this quarter should be a 4.0, but I will still unfortunately be applying with around a 3.1 gpa. If they consider progress reports while reviewing applications it should be around a 3.3. I work almost full time on top of juggling school entirely online and heard that if I mention how I've been employed my chances of acceptance may increase? Luckily, I'm pretty good with essays and personal statements as well. I am also going to be applying to the poly sci major if that means anything.

I know these are not great numbers gpa-wise, but I have a really awesome opportunity to move to Seattle pre-acceptance confirmation in June with a pretty good part time job already lined up, and I would love to go for it but worry about locking into a lease and then fucking over my roommates if I don't get accepted and need to move to Bellingham for my backup school (WWU). Basically I'm just asking how stupid it would be for me to take the jump.

How hard is it to get a 3-4 person suite as a freshman?
Apparently the triples are pretty cramped so I was considering a suite instead but I saw that there’s way less of those. Is it hard for freshmen to get a suite considering upperclassmen get first pick? More specifically the newer ones, like Madrona, McCarty, and Willow

How do u put in the bare minimum to pass?
So usually I’m kind of a perfectionist, put my all into everything, etc, etc, and usually get good grades.

However, this quarter I’m taking a class that is super hard (and also an unreasonable amount of work for the number of credits) so I’m trying to figure out what to do to get by without failing.

I have a lot of other things going on that are frankly more important than said class, but I don’t really want a failed class on my transcript.

History Double Major Questions
Hello, I am currently finishing off my freshman year at UW and am hoping to be an International Studies major. However, I have been looking to double major but am still trying to narrow down what other subject I should major in, history being one of them. I have not yet taken any courses in the history department, but one of my classes (JSIS 200) was basically a history class taught by a history professor, and so far it has been my favorite class. Of course, I have always heard jabs when I mentioned my potential interest in majoring in history ("it's a useless major/you can only get a career as a teacher/if you like history so much why not just read about it instead of majoring in it"), but I believe it is worth it if is an enjoyable subject, plus it pairs up with my current major which basically requires a knowledge of history. I just want to ask how the history department here is (workload, quality), what opportunities there are with the major, and what people can suggest as ideas for a course of action. Thanks.

Are classes in the Fall going to be required in person attendance

Need 5 non-business credits
As I’m nearing the end of my degree, I still need 5 non-business credits and wondered if anyone had any recommendations for fall 2021? I have no preference on what subject, if it’s easy or not, etc. Any class goes, it just needs to be 5 credits and not business. Thanks in advance!

A rant on phys 121

Dean's list and what it means
I didn't make the Dean's list in fall quarter due to having to S/NS a grade but I made it in winter quarter, but unfortunately I don't qualify for the list this year since it has to be at least 3 quarters with 12 or more graded credits.

What's more important, the Dean's List or just keeping your grades up and involving yourself in extracurriculars? Distance learning has got me kinda bored so I'm wondering what there is to do outside of classes.

How is the IMA weight section?
Hey folks, I'm a first year grad student at UW. I'm fully vaccinated so have been looking to get back into lifting (started as a complete beginner last year before the lockdown, so I'd be starting basically new). 

It looks like the IMA is an option but I've heard mixed reviews of the weight section not having enough equipment (waiting forever for the gear you need). All I need for now is a barbell-- a personal trainer started me on a really basic 5x5 stronglifts routine last year, so I figure I'll just resume with that and work up to other stuff. Thing is, I live across town from UW (Central District), and if I'm trying to figure out if it's worth the drive/dealing with parking or if I should just get a cheap membership closer to home.

What's your experience with the weight section? Also, is the weight room separate from everything else? My undergrad university gym had a separate weight room that always seemed really intimidating to step into as a newcomer not knowing where to go and what to do. I know you just have to get over that hump but I am curious what the general atmosphere is?

"humansofuniversity" Facebook Scam is Charging People to Join UW Class Facebook Pages
A few years ago, I became aware of a few facebook pages that were in control of many university class facebook pages (ex: University of Washington Class of 2024, Penn State Class of 2025). These are just a few random examples out of hundreds more. I found this to be very strange since these pages do not seem to be affiliated with any actual university, nor was I able to find out more information about them. Furthermore, when I tried to click join on my facebook university class page, they told me I needed to subscribe to their website for $2.50 a month. Yes, pay money **to join a facebook group**. I actually tried to join without paying this and they blocked my facebook account from even viewing the page even though I am a UW student. I have noticed these pages pop up in the past 3 years or so but I don't believe before that. Someone needs to do something about this as it is affecting not only us but hundreds of other universities and tens of thousands of other students. It is disgusting profiteering and I am not sure of the legality of it but forcing students to pay a fee to some shady organization to join a facebook group seems fishy. I know these facebook groups are not created or administered by the university so again, I don't know of the legality, but if something can be done, it should be done.

Here is their webpage for UW: [https://humansofuniversity.com/udub-facebook-group/?fbclid=IwAR0fuay6eQaLcaXCgEmoG3owLJNIJ0m4ElaJOFybhpl2bhenfv\_pOUkCwfA](https://humansofuniversity.com/udub-facebook-group/?fbclid=IwAR0fuay6eQaLcaXCgEmoG3owLJNIJ0m4ElaJOFybhpl2bhenfv_pOUkCwfA)

AP Testing
Hello everyone! I am an incoming freshman at the UW, and I would appreciate it if I can receive some input from you all. I know that UW doesn't take AP Lit credit, so I planned on just not taking my AP Lit test next month, but when I reached out to my schools AP coordinator, she told me that it is too late to cancel my test; however, I can simply not show up. However, she also said that if I do not take it, the AP designation and weighted GPA will be removed from my transcript. 

Would this negatively affect my admission status at all if I end up just not taking it? Im debating if I should take it but not try (I want to put more energy into studying for my AP tests that actually count) or if I should just not take it. Thank you for all your help in advance!

BIOC 426 Lab

--------------------------------------------------
In-person fall melancholy
In theory I am overjoyed that classes (most likely) will be in-person for fall. I was able to bide my time for the last 4 quarters with prereqs and math so I could save the major related courses that I was really hoping to have in person for next year. I am not complaining that we should have gone back sooner, it is paramount that we do not risk the health and lives of those in our community.

But, I can't help but feel that returning to school is really bittersweet. All my (3) friends are graduating this spring and I missed a year of memories of walking with them to class, goofing off in lab, or even smoking behind ODE while killing time before a study group. It's things like that that make life rich and I have one more year left but I won't know anyone anymore. Our normal is changed too, we will still be socially distanced and have to wear masks. School being online indefinitely kinda let me shut my brain off, immerse myself in work, and not be confronted with the outside world and all the implications of the past year. Going back to school makes those thoughts unavoidable- all the professors that only know me as a screen name during office hours that I don't have a rapport with and won't be able to reach out to down the road, all the classmates I have taken so many classes with but have never made genuine eye contact with, all the time I spent in front of a computer instead of walking through campus. 

Anyways, I guess this isn't really working up to anything in particular, I just wanted to say I miss everyone and if you have mixed feelings I have them too lol. I look forward to seeing you all in person, and I hope whatever hardship you've experienced for this past year eases soon. I am really proud to be apart of a student body that is so resilient and caring, it is nice to not be alone in the loneliness.

Accepted into "Pre-Science". Help?
Last month I got accepted into UW, my dream school, however I applied for Computer Science, and got accepted into Pre-Science. UW's website basically tells you that you can't transfer into CS after 2 years, since they mainly take only freshman applicants. This was the only school I got into out of my apps (other than some waitlists for a few UC's), and I'm stuck on whether or not I should go. Are there any majors very similar to CS or ones that I should be interested in at Washington?

If you click the Previous version you will see the differences. It could be a sign that INFO department changed the course to adapt to a new syllabus.

Engineering freshman dorm room recommendation
I'm a freshman engineering student. I'm considering the dorms that I gonna live from this fall, but I don't know which hall is the best choice for the freshman whose major is engineering. 

I'm considering these 2 factors for choosing my dorm

\-the hall near the engineering building

\-the hall with private room (not necessary)

outdoor track usage for running??
just wondering if we’re allowed to use the track by the soccer field/IMA for running for leisure? i’m not sure if there are any rules for non-athletes using it but it’s always empty so i’m just curious

Freshman Roommate situation
I'm going to be at UW this fall and have been (unsuccessfully) looking for a roommate. I really suck at texting, especially when I don't already know someone so I haven't been able to really click with anyone in time. I was hoping to find a roommate before May but I don't think I will be able to do that.

For those of you who also weren't able to or decided not to find a roommate before hand, do you think it is important to do so? Like, how much does it matter/does it matter at all to find a roommate or would it be fine to do random?

Thank you!

Today is my birthday, and I submitted my app for the BASW program this morning.
I am returning to college after a couple years break. I decided to make a career change, and was looking for a program that aligned with my goals. Among a bunch of other reasons (great student feedback, super helpful dept director), when I found out the application due date was on my birthday, I felt like that was the final push to just apply. I had to apply as a transfer in February, but if the SSW accepts me then I should be good to go. I am even more anxious AFTER having submitted my application! Lol. Good luck to everyone who applied.

Waitlisted, then appealed
Hey guys, I am a senior in high school and UW is my top choice. I got waitlisted and sent in my appeal on March 15. Still haven't heard back and it's been more than 4 weeks :/ I was wondering if anyone was in the same boat as me, and what this could possibly mean.
