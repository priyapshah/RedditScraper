[MEGATHREAD 8] Post your questions about admissions, Pittsburgh, and coming to CMU info (e.g. majors, dorms) here!
This megathread is to help prevent top-level posts from being downvoted and then left unanswered, and also to provide one thread as a reference for folks with future questions. You don't _have_ to post here, but I recommend it. :)

This thread is automatically sorted by "new", so post away, even if there are a lot of comments.

For best results, remember to search this page and the previous megathreads for keywords (like "transfer", "dorm", etc.) before posting a question that is identical or very similar to one that's already been asked. /r/pittsburgh is also a generally better resource for questions that aren't specific to CMU.

As a reminder, **you can report posts that should be comments in the megathread instead** if seeing them posted at top-level bothers you. Please choose "It breaks r/cmu's rules" and then "Use the megathread" as the reason.
Request flair from AutoMod here!
Request flair from AutoMod by commenting **in this thread only**. AutoMod should reply either with a confirmation or to tell you it didn't understand the request.

If you want a major that isn't listed, I'll add it to the list. If you want a flair that doesn't fit this format, I'm happy to customize yours if you send modmail.

Is Triple Counting a class allowed
Can one get credit for a class in her major and in 2 minors at the same time. The wording seems to imply this is allowed but it is not explicit.
Anyone here get off the waitlist in previous years?
