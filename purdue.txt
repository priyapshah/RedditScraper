Some questions on 'The Data Mine - Corporate Parterships' Learning Community
- To start with, some context please? I got an email saying that's where I was placed, but do not know what it entails. 
- How good is the program? Is it hard to get into? 
- Do the projects undertaken count for course credits? Does taking the program increase the years it takes to graduate?
- Any tips to maximize my experience in the Learning Community? 

Thank you for your advice - I appreciate it!

River Market Walk to Campus
For those of you who have lived in river market apartments, is the walk to campus every day is feasible? I wanted to get a parking pass but since that does not fall outside of the 1.5 mile radius, I likely won't be eligible and may have no choice but to walk. Thanks!

To the Loud Motorcycle Gang Driving near Rise and Chauncey
Please don't be an ass and rev your engine so loud. You spooked everyone in the vincinity, nearly rammed the car in front of yall, and made every kid in a 100 feet radius cry. Also, I could tell that you and the rest of your pals have been doing it way too much because your motorcycle engines have been so worn out an electric scooter accelerates faster than you went at the green lights.

I've heard you last fall when you did the same thing at 3 AM in the morning every day. You guys rattled my windows and pretty much forced everyone in the area to be sleep deprived. Just please don't.

What is the quality and value of a Purdue Global graduate degree in psychology? I work for Purdue, so it is completely free (and part-time), but I don't know anything about it.
 

Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this. I thought people here might be able to answer my questions.

So I just finished up a two semesters of a teaching assistantship at Purdue Fort Wayne (four courses each semester), and I landed an administrative job, which I am super excited about. One thing they told me is that since I am a Purdue employee the Purdue Global tuition is free, if I wanted to pursue that.

I honestly don't know anything about it and don't want to make any assumptions, so I am asking this for two reasons. First, can anyone comment on the quality of the courses? It involves statistics, cognitive psychology, neuropsychology, etc. and a master's thesis.

Second, can I use some of this coursework to supplement weaknesses in my undergraduate degree (in which I acquired a BA in philosophy and a minor in psychology), if I were to pursue a brick-and-mortar MA/MS degree in psychology in the traditional format? (Regarding my qualifications in psychology in general, I did interview for a clinical psychology Ph.D. program some years ago at Duquesne University).

Thanks!

Seeking Fellow Music Nerds for Casual Summer Jam Sessions
Anyone staying on campus this summer want to form a casual band? Nothing serious, just for kicks.

Or even just have some jam sessions -- I'm starved for musical interaction.

I sing, play piano, and know a few basic guitar chords. 

Literally anyone is welcome!

Lmk what you play and/or if you sing!

Can Snapchat Sustain a Friendship? [Anonymous Survey]
Hello /r/Purdue! I am an undergraduate student at the University of Washington in Seattle and I’m running a study on how the use of the social media app Snapchat is influencing feelings of connection within friendships during the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, I’m looking to recruit college students from around the country who use Snapchat to take **a short, 15 minute, anonymous survey** about their experiences thus far in the pandemic in regard to how connected they are feeling to their friends.

What happens if you get put into your second choice major after FYE?
So I'm pretty sure I'm going to miss the 3.2 gpa cutoff to get into MechE which puts me in jeopardy of getting in. I am now srsly considering CompE and honestly after doing a bit more research I'm thinking abt switching even if I get into MechE. So assuming I get rejected from MechE how does registration work for next semester? Will I miss out on registering on core classes and have to catch up?

FYI, my intended major is civil engineering and I prefer doing practical things.

Thanks.

Do I have to have a roommate by may 5th?
Hey guys! So I just committed last night but I still don’t have a roommate. I haven’t reached out to anyone yet so it would probably take me a long time to find someone. I know the housing contract is due may 5th, but do I still have time to find a roommate after I’ve signed the contract, or would I be forced to go random?

Also, if I go random, is there like a personality survey or something people fill out so that your roommate is someone you’d get along with, or is it actually completely random?

Thanks!

WTF 1Bowl
So yesterday was my second time trying the fruit bowl and I loved it. It is healthy and tasty and most of all, it gives a break from the monotonous dining court food. But yesterday, 1Bowl decided to fuck me over. I love their yogurt and that is the most filling part of the bowl. Unfortunately, they had a no extra yogurt policy yesterday night. I repeat yogurt is the most filling part of the meal. Let's not even talk about my meal swipe being wasted on a bowl that did not even fill me up. I do not know how and when they decide to stop giving extra food, but it is incredibly rude to not give food when someone is paying/asking for it. I cannot get over how disappointed and frustrated I am with this new system where they decide how much we get to eat.

PS: I got only 1 scoop of yogurt. My tummy was crying.

So, my problem is I got accepted to TAMU engineering, but I desire Purdue over TAMU. My question is, should I choose TAMU safely or should I try CODOing at Purdue to FYE? Is CODOing into FYE hard?

Guys and Dollies Packing Supplies
Hi everyone,

I was looking for a place to store my stuff this summer, and I was considering Guys and Dollies. They have this very nice feature where they will give you free packing materials via drop-offs at various locations on campus. You can then set up an appointment to have these boxes picked up later.

I just found out I missed their last on-campus materials drop-off this spring by only a couple of hours. It's totally my fault for not planning ahead. They say on their website that if you find one of their trucks parked somewhere on campus, you can still ask the crew for free packing materials.

If anyone has any appointments or knows anyone that has any appointments with Guys and Dollies (and therefore knows where a truck may be parked at some specific time), please let me know.

Thanks for reading

Missed housing deadline
so I was on campus this fall and online this semester as a freshman. I thought that since I was online in the spring, I would have till the end of the semester to sign a housing contract. well i was wrong and now I'm on the waitlist for housing. So, does anyone know what the chances are to get on campus housing from the waitlist? Here's a picture

How is Data Mine Corporate Partners?
Hi there! I'm a (soon-to-be) freshman at Purdue, and am also a Data Science major.

I applied for the Corporate Partners section of the Data Mine learning community, and was accepted.

I'm just wondering, for people that are in it (especially current freshman), how is it? Is it excessively difficult, or a lot of work (on top of coursework)? What kind of activities do you do within the learning community (other than the generic ones listed on the website)? They said that it's okay if you don't have experience in data science (and I mostly don't), but is that really true, or are you expected to have knowledge/experience? Is there anything else I should know about Corporate Partners?

Thank you so much!

How absolutely fucked am I?
Okay, so I'm a senior graduating this May, and I have a job lined up. I have one class, where I am currently set to fail. I need to get at least a D in this class to graduate, and with no assignments or quizzes or final left, I am left 13 points short out of 300 total. This is mostly due to my own lack of motivation to do anything (depression is a bitch). The class was so easy, it was just 15 open everything quizzes over the whole semester, but I didn't understand that because the syllabus is outdated. So I missed the last critical quiz which was worth extra, and now I'm failing. I have emailed the professor who is out of office until monday but I just feel like I'm fucked. It's over. I thought about jumping off the parking garage last night, I can't take it. What do I do. I feel powerless. I feel like he is just gonna read my email and think "get fucked kid" and I won't graduate, I won't get the job. I can't eat im not hungry I can't sleep. I just want to curl into a ball and cry until I die. I have been writing a long essay to demonstrate my knowledge of the class and that this was just a small fuck up but I know he won't care at all. I failed myself and its not his job to pick up the pieces. Please, what do I do?

Rap battles?

FYE elective
I’m entering FYE in the fall and was originally planning on going into compE, but now as I’m realizing I don’t know SQUAT about computers I’m leaning towards mechE. I already have the credit for chm 115/116 so i don’t think I would have to take CS 159 for elective credit unless I want to, but will taking it help me figure out if compE is a good major for me? Or will just taking ENGR 133 do the trick? (I heard ENGR 133 exposes you to all fields on ENGR)

ECE 368 in summer
What's this class like in terms of workload and coding? I am pretty sure the structure of the class in summer is different than a regular semester. Also, I think some graduate student is going to teach it instead of a faculty.
--------------------------------------------------
Summer Relet
Hello, I’m looking for someone to take over my room for the summer (Mid May-July 31). I stay at Hub State Street, it’s a 4 br/ 2 bath and rent is $743/month + Utilities. I am willing to negotiate the pricing as well! Super close to campus, room has an amazing view, and you have access to all the amenities that’s offered! Feel free to message me with any questions you may have!

Lib(dot)purdue
For some reason I can’t access the Web of Science through Purdue libraries. It seems to me that the whole library website is down at the moment. Is this true for anyone else?

Did the CS department ever release the official announcement on CODOs as they said they would?
In their earlier announcement this semester the department said they would release another official announcement as to whether or not CODOs would be open in the fall. Have they released this announcement yet to the advisors or students?

Airport ITap computers SUCK
Other people that use the upstairs lab know my pain. Half of them take years to log on and the other half are so god damned slow that I am honestly debating pulling my hair out at this point. I just love staring into the perpetual “Welcome” screen when I just have to print out a 2 page report. I’ve been waiting for 30 FUCKING MINUTES and the one that finally signs on gives me nothing but a black screen. I hate this place.

I’ve already sent Purdue HR an email but it takes time to get a reply. Thanks!

Math 212 IVY summer course VS. MA166
I'm an incoming freshmen in FYE and I have a bit of a weird situation, I can transfer in credit from Calc 1 and my Calc 3 class but not Calc 2, so I'm wondering if I'd want to do Calc 2 at Ivy Tech or at Purdue. 

I've heard that MA166 deals with vectors and Math 212 doesn't, which is important for Engineering, but I've already taken Calc 3 and DiffEQ which both went over vectors. 

Are there any other reasons to take MA166 over taking 212 at Ivy Tech, or do I want to get out of taking purdue's Calc 2 in any way possible? 

&#x200B;

Any advice appreciated!

Will Purdue Rescind Me?
I’m a Freshmen at IPFW and my first semester, I finished with a 3.93 (because of one A-). That’s when I applied to Purdue under a language major. I just found out that I got accepted, but then quickly realized it was a conditional acceptance. I plan on majoring in Nutrition, so I took a BIO and a CHEM lab, and BIO I might be able to pass, but CHEM I am definitely getting an F. Definitely. BIO has been hard because we only get 50 mins of lab time per week (due to hybrid scheduling) and my CHEM class... the teacher has a very thick Russian/German accent, she doesn’t explain hardly anything, she has 100 minutes per week to go through more than 100 PowerPoint slides and so she obviously didn’t take the time to even give us practice problems or anything. When she assigns us homework, she never gives us any feedback and only says, “You did it wrong”. I know that the majority of my class is failing, and when one student expressed that to her, she literally said, “It’s okay to fail!” I don’t know who told her that but it’s really sucked because it’s going to hurt me, I know. I know there was more I could’ve done to make sure I passed but chem is something I generally struggle with and the onus was basically on me to teach myself everything. 

Like I said, I’m accepted under a Japanese major. The class I MIGHT fail is BIO, best case scenario is a C-, but I know I will fail CHEM. F. Fail. I’m retaking BIO over the summer though, so I hope I have a better grade before they consider rescinding me.

With 2 F’s, I will go from a 3.93 to a 2.97. If I pass BIO with a C-, I will end with a 3.01. If I retake BIO in the summer and get an A, I will end up with a 3.5. It’s still significantly worse than what I applied with.

I also had to move 3 times during this semester and had a strained relationship with my family. I was commuting 3 hours a day for about 2 months, which was physically and emotionally exhausting. 

Anyway. You get my point. How possible do you guys think it is for me to get rescinded, all things considered?

Money
I’m a high school senior and wondering if Purdue does scholarship appeals. I want to reach out to my admissions representative but I when I am they say all scholarships have been sent out. I like purdue but i cannot justify the price.

The vending machine on WALC 2nd floor is a Joke
It says accepting “new payment options: discover, visa, amex” and has a card reader on it. Then it says cash only on the card reader. I have been in WALC since 1pm and have drank all 3 1L water that I brought with me. I’m like alright I’ll try to find someone to Venmo to get some cash, and I got 3 $1 and 1 $20 in case $3 wasn’t enough. Well well well, the card reader first showed “$1 only” after rejecting the $20 bill, then rejected two of the $1 bills. Someone then told me there’s a vending machine on the first floor that accepts credit cards, so I tried to get the $1 that I haven’t used back. No matter what button I press, it doesn’t refund me the $1 bill. This is such a terrible user experience, even worse than the customer service at IRS or BMV. This machine is a joke. Rant is over. Going home now.

Worried about MA 162
I know C’s get degrees but I’m incredible worried about getting that. Right now my weighted grade in bright space is a 50.03/75, or about .7% above the current C cutoff (66%). I want to get into ECE (so I’m pretty sure I need a C minimum in this class). I was wondering if anyone has any study tips for the final, the weighting of last semesters grade, or anything else that can help me in my darkest hour. Thank you, good luck on finals, and calc can suck it.

Taking ME200 Elsewhere

Got a mail from saying that I "made a request to terminate your Office 365 email"... Is this scam?
Hello, future freshman here.

I just got an email saying "Process has begun by our administrator. Our record indicates that you recently  made a request to terminate your Office 365 email.  And this process has begun by our administrator. If this request was made accidentally and you have no knowledge of it, you are advised to verify your account below." Looks pretty sketchy to me as it asks for my password and email account through a google form. I have not made any request to close my account btw. What caught me off guard is the sender seems to have a purdue email. 

I very much appreciate any kind of help

Taking both lin algebra and calc 3 during summer before FYE?
Good idea or bad idea? I’d like to just get the credits out of the way, but if they are important for my major (hoping for compE) then I’m not sure what to do. I took calc 1/2 and honestly didn’t learn much cuz my CC prof didn’t give two shits cuz of covid. 

But I think it’d be nice to get them over with cuz I’ve heard they’re tough at Purdue, and maybe I could take a semester or two off of math before I take dif eq. (Which I could possibly take at CC as well.) 

Any advice?

To the people with really loud cars on campus
This post is for the people that have really loud exhausts and rev them super loud at 1am right near all of the dorm on campus.

I am just genuinely confused.  I’m not really mad I just need to understand the psychology behind it. Why would you spend thousands of dollars on a new exhaust just to put on your shitbox Nissan that you only drive around when and where people are trying to sleep and study?
Is it a dare?
Is something/someone forcing you do to this?
Is it to compromise?
Is it for adrenaline?  If so please just do coke like the rest of us.  It will be way more exciting and you’ll bother way less people.

Thank you

ESPN Ranks Purdue's Rondale Moore 9th-Best Receiver in Final Draft Rankings
ESPN's Todd McShay released his final 2021 NFL Draft rankings. Purdue's top-rated prospect, Rondale Moore, is the ninth-ranked wide receiver and the 54th-ranked player overall. 

Moore once upon a time seemed to be a lock for the first round, but after measuring 5-foot-7 at Purdue's Pro Day, he's been falling down the draft boards.

I am a [Purdue Student] looking for [Taco Bell Mild Sauce]
Hi fellow Boilermakers, I am in dire need of some Taco Bell mild sauce. 

I’ve looked everywhere, every grocery store, everywhere it might be, and there is no mild sauce to be found, anywhere. 

Tragic, I know. 

Why do I need so much sauce?

I am cooking a dinner for my grandmother. I am making some homemade enchiladas, and instead of an “enchilada sauce” I use Taco Bell sauce. It’s great! You should try it! Unfortunately, she doesn’t like spicy stuff, so I am really looking for mild, specifically. 

Does anyone have any spare bottles lying around? Or even several(like, a lot) packets?

EDIT: It’s needed by tomorrow, the biggest issue
EDIT 2: unfortunately I have looked at all the grocery stores around here already, and they are all out

My friend's grandma had to wait 8 hours (the whole night) till she found a hospital that took her in because all hospitals in the city ran out of beds; because of this delay, she didn't survive. This is just one story, the list is long (feel free to share your feelings, stories etc). We're all having a very rough, stressful, and depressing time. Please check in on your Indian friends.

How lenient is Purdue's financial aid?
For the last two years I've been given a 10k grant which makes Purdue within my budget. There was an error this year, and when I spoke to them, they said it was because my EFC was around 36k, which was over their 20k limit. Well, I found the issue in my FAFSA, corrected the error, but now I'm getting an EFC of 20,400, even though nothing has changed since last year when it was calculated as 13k. I wrote them an appeal letter practically begging for the grant... how likely are they to consider it? I'm already graduating early and working and getting a summer job... I really need this to be able to afford to graduate next year.

PHYS 272 Final Exam/General Questions
1) I think I should be able to pass the class but I really don't want to tank my GPA so got any tips for studying for the PHYS 272 final? I'm thinking of going through all the textbook sections, going over the midterms, problem quizzes, and practice exams and resolving all those questions. After that, I'll do a practice final I found online and then restudy the weak areas. But not really sure what else to do as the exam content always seems to be something new and we haven't been given a practice final yet (which will probably be useless like the other practice exams we've been given anyways). 

2) Also, anyone know how hard the final exam for 272 usually is in comparison to the midterms and if 272 usually lowers the grade cutoffs after the final? The first and second midterm averages have been 66  and 69% respectively so not exactly sure if I should be expecting a curve or not after the final.

To my favorite Jersey Mikes Man
You made my semester, truly. Not only have you memorized me AND my entire friend groups order but you noticed I had not been to Jersey's in a while and asked how I was doing. I know it seems minor to you but I have been struggling with drug withdrawals and this was the first time I could get up and eat by myself in 4 days. People like you give me hope.

How did out-of-state people bring your desktop pc to campus?
Going to campus next year by plane and I’m wondering how I should transport my desktop. I want to bring both my desktop and my mediocre laptop because I heard that bringing both a desktop and laptop is advisable). 

Important factors to me are price and safety of the parts.

What did you all do and how well did it work out for you?

Can undergraduates take graduate-level courses?
 Has anyone taken or know someone who has taken a graduate-level course? And how it applies to the graduation requirements? I'm trying to take a biostatistics course, but it seems like a graduate-level course is all Purdue seems to offer. Is it possible if there isn't a prerequisite?

Best grocery shop
So, I am an international student and I am not very familiar with grocery shopping in the US. Which store do you guys think is cheaper but still being high quality on groceries and other items, and with variety. Or you can also recommend where is better to buy certain stuff like meat, fruits, dorm stuff, etc. The ones that I am comparing are Meijer, ~~Best buy~~ Walmart, Target since they are closest to campus, if you any other suggestion that is also close to campus lmk.

Dropping out of honors college while living in honors housing
Hi! My friend and I are both living in honors housing (ie Duhme, Griffin South, etc) next year. We’re both going be sophomores. However, we are planning on dropping out of the honors college sometime next year. 

Will honors college kick us out of our rooms if we quit? Or will we be allowed to live there until the end of the year?

How is Purdue Data Science?
Hi there! I’m a potential Purdue student (class of 2025!), and have a quick question.

Thank you!

Questions about Cap and Gown this semester
Hello all,

Professor made online final a different time than MyPurdue listing
The myPurdue exam is on Wednesday, but the professor has made the exam on Monday. Is this allowed? I think it's because the course has both distance learners and in-class learners and the in-class learners were scheduled for Monday. Final exam schedules were released so long ago and I figured this whole time the final was on Wednesday and I'm just now hearing it's on Monday for the first time in a video lecture. Is it worth emailing?

How much work is VIP 27920?
Sorry for adding to all the review my schedule posts. I'm trying to gauge how bad next semester is going to be. I'm taking 15 credit hours this semester with EPICS, and am struggling a lot to balance all the work. Next semester, I was planning on taking 16 credit hours with VIP and if the total workload is just as bad, I might as well drop something now. 

And if anyone wants to make any comments, this is my Fall 2021:

ECE29401 (sophomore seminar), MA265, ECE20002, ECE20875, ECE270, VIP 27920

Honestly, it doesn't seem that bad, but this semester PHYS272 singlehandedly destroyed me. I like the content but if any other class is structured like this I'd rather take it over summer or not at all.

Anyone take MGMT 44362 or 44430 before? ECON 385?
ECON 385 is a fix for me over the summer and would still appreciate what I can expect if anyone's taken it before. But between the two MGMT classes, I get to choose one or the other to take over the summer. 44430 is taught by Dr. Chupp which I have had wonderful experiences with but the VERY few reviews on this specific class I read were all horrible. And 44362 apparently is a ghost town so any feedback would be awesome.

Parking recommendations for the last couple weeks
So I purchased a car this weekend and I’m a resident at Hawkins. Poor timing but I needed to. They’re not selling permits and I need somewhere (or several spots to rotate off of) to park the car for the last couple weeks of school 

Any suggestions besides leaving it in the McCutcheon garage? Anyone know of apartment complexes selling spots?

Purpose of MA 262? (Combined Lin Alg & Diff Eq)
I'm in FYE right now, and I'm intending on going into mechanical. I'm signed up for MA 262 in the fall, which is apparently MA 265 and 266 combined into one semester, and its designed mostly for MEs. I'm curious what the point is in doing this? Is there something the MEs need both linear algebra and differential equations for that takes place a semester sooner than for other majors? 

Is this class combined with the expectation that students would take calc 3 in the fall of sophomore year and then have LA&DE done in time for internships by the end of spring? 

Any explanation or advice is appreciated :D

Think Summer and Internships
Hi! I have taken summer classes since my sophomore year of high school. I was hoping to continue that for a few summers into college (I'm an incoming freshman for FYE) to work on some gen eds and maybe some less important prerequisites. I was wondering if this would prohibit me from being able to do internships. Are we able to take summer classes and have an internship or does it have to be either or?

Data Mine Corporate Partners
Hi, I managed to get in the Data Mine corporate partners LC for AY 2021-22. I attended the symposium held recently this month and found out about some interesting projects and companies.

Do these projects teach us these skills from scratch?

I created a large student survey last summer (450 redditors participated) and am back with survey #2
If you check my post history you'll see that I circulated a student survey last summer across various college subreddits. About 450 students participated, and the survey data was written up in a [Medium Piece](https://medium.com/@liviamorris/i-feel-that-the-future-ive-been-working-towards-my-whole-life-is-gone-now-what-students-have-b33e5d09456b?source=friends_link&sk=ef9ef45585d8c9c8aff6eaa007cd09d3).

Now that we've been in the pandemic for over a year, I'd love to get your guys' feedback once again. The first survey was largely about the difficulties of adjusting to the pandemic, while this one is focused more on how the pandemic has impacted mental health and mentorship, as well as whether you feel that your campus is supportive of students who want to pursue independent projects (e.g. startups, creative endeavors, on-campus initiatives, etc.). All responses are anonymous (no personal info is collected) and you can opt whether to have your responses included in the write-up. 

If anyone has questions, please feel free to ask. And if anyone wants a copy of the raw data when it's ready, PM me and I'll add your name to the list. 

Thanks so much - and good luck with midterms/finals!

Will Purdue rescind their offer of admissions if I fail my calculus class?
My calculus teacher hasn’t been grading papers on time and so I have no idea whether or not I’m failing calculus (prior to this, my GPA in HS was 3.97 unweighted and 4.41 weighted). If I fail AP calculus BC would they be likely to rescind their offer? I probably won’t fail, but I just want to check because I am literally pulling out my hair over this. I’m out of state, btw, idk if that affects it.

Question about scheduling
Hey everyone, scared/excited incoming freshman here. You all have been super helpful in the past and I just wanna thank you for that and I’m hoping to get a little more advice. For my intended major (forestry and natural resources) I need to take applied calc 1 and a few stats classes after that, and my plan was to take the equivalent calc class at ivy tech this summer. However, I was just wondering if something came up and I couldn’t take it this summer if I had to take it this year or if I could wait until next summer? Message me if that doesn’t make sense but yeah, any help would be very appreciated.

Scholarships based on freshman performance?
I'm a current freshman at Purdue. I was never awarded any scholarships based on my high school grades (had a 3.5 and 30 ACT, and not a lot of extracurriculars). 

However, this year I'm doing really well. I've got a 4.0 and I'm track to keep it. I'm also active in two clubs and had research in the fall. I'm wondering if there are any scholarship opportunities for someone based off of Purdue performance rather than high school. As far as I'm aware, the merit based scholarships are all purely high school, so since I didn't get one already I can't get one now.

I'm in FYE, going into Mechanical, in case that matters.

Thanks!

Withdrawing from CS240
Im in a rut and wanted to figure out what exactly to do about CS240. I literally have learnt nothing from the way this professor teaches and have never been more lost in a class. At this point it seems my grade isn't salvageable and I am not sure if it would be better to drop the class and take a W or if I should continue the class and have it show on my transcript with a high chance of me retaking. I wanted some help about what route I should take going about this.

Housing question: single vs triple for freshman
Incoming Honors College student here.

My roommate and I are choosing a Double with AC as our first preference. The only two left in the honors residence are triple with AC and single with AC, and we can't decide the order for them.

I'm against the idea of going single for freshman year as I feel it might be a little lonely or something lol. Is triple too small? And is single a bad idea? Also, how likely are we to get the double w/ AC? Please advice, thanks!

My Calc BC exam is in a week and I'm scared...how bad can the consequences be?

I got into FYE and I plan on majoring in Computer Engineering...let's say I don't get the credits for Calc BC because my prep for the AP exam is shite....how fucked am I for college? 

&#x200B;

I've heard that Calc 2 is insanely difficult and destroys your GPA....will I be fine? Should I get the Calc 1 credit at Purdue and start from Calc 2 freshman year first semester? Or should I re-do Calc 1 and then Calc 2 second semester? 

&#x200B;

Thanks

Purdue University Global (Online)
Good Morning, I'm an Air Force officer who is looking into getting my Master's degree in Organizational Leadership, my curriculum are that costs be low (approx 500/credit max), that it's a good reputation school so that in twenty years when I retire from the Air Force the degree will actually help me, and lastly that the school have a good quality of education, as I'm not just getting my master's to check a box, I genuinely enjoy the subject and want to learn as much as possible.

I came across Purdue University Global and thought it was everything I wanted, especially to be such a good reputation school for only 320/credit (after military discount), but now the more I'm looking, I'm realizing it is not exactly the same as Purdue.

My question, does Purdue University Global carry the same reputation as Purdue itself? How do the two relate? They seem to be to be almost two branches of the same tree similar to a school of nursing vs a school of engineering at the same university, but could somebody help me understand how they relate and give me your thoughts on the rigor/reputation of a Purdue University Global degree? Thanks.

Edit: My question then is over the next 20+ years do you see Purdue assimilating Global to the point where a Purdue and a Purdue Global degree are about the same in quality and reputation?

FYE Questions
Hi y'all,

I'm currently signed up to take AP Micro (but not macro) and as a prospective first year engineer (or just engineering major), I was wondering if it's worth it to spend the next few weeks to study for (as I can still cancel it). Since I'm only taking one of the econs, I'll only be getting undistributed econ credit. Does anyone know if this contributes as credit towards an engineering degree (specifically computer/ee)?

Additionally, I'm also wondering if completing an engineering degree in 3 years is possible at Purdue? I know that the Degree in 3 program is a thing, but I'm not sure if it's applicable towards engineering, especially considering FYE is a thing. I have the AP credits to cover the math and science FYE credits (I would only need to take the engineering intro + communication classes), so would it be possible to squeeze all of the remaining courses into one semester to complete all of the FYE requirements?

I apologize for all of these questions mushed together, but if anyone could help me out or link me any resources, I would greatly appreciate it!

My credits already carry me through the vast majority of FYE, what do I do?
I have credits for every single FYE class except for the seminars. (Including the ones required to get me into the AAE major \[chem\]). Can I just take second year AAE courses as electives instead of those classes?

Also, can I test out of multivariate calculus and/or Physics 172 I took calc 3 in highschool and I really don't want to repeat it. A friend of mine who graduated from Purdue told me I could. I got a 4 in the mechanics test.

Calculus credit question
Hi everyone! I’m not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I wasn’t really able to find any answers online. I’m currently a high school senior and I will most likely attend Purdue next year. I’m taking ap calc bc right now but I’m planning on taking calc 3 over the summer through an online course. If I take the online course and get credit for calc 3, does it cover credit for calc 1&2 or would I still need to take and pass the ap calc bc exam? Again, sorry if this is the wrong place to ask haha

My computer desktop is a literal mess( like actual nightmare fuel) but i do not have the time to organize it. I’d be down to pay someone on campus to help organize them or just do it for me because its starting to actually slow down my computer but i just dont have the time to organize anymore.

Edit: i am a twitter artist tho so there is gonna be some weird stuff in there as a heads up

Any advice for a worried potential compE student?
I'm in the codo process for compE right now and I'm worried right now because this feels like the point of no return. On paper, the courses for compE sound fun and the other clubs/extracurriculars surrounding the course seem fun as well but I'm worried that the amount of work from the tougher compE classes will just kill my motivation to do compE. I already feel like I connect too much of my enjoyment in a class to how good of a grade I get in that class in the end (as evident by my lack of enjoyment of PHYS 272 and how it's currently killing my motivation to do anything) which I feel like will only get worse with the much tougher compE classes I'll have to take. I'm doing ok in FYE right now but no class has actually been that enjoyable for me (except for CS 159 for the most part) which feels wrong. I feel like I should be enjoying these classes but I don't for the most part. So any advice for me? Just feel like I don't know what I'm doing and like it's going to become too late for me to do anything about very shortly (if it hasn't already).

Is there racism at Purdue?
Hi. I have to make a decision soon about going to Purdue for a PhD in ME. Something that worries me is that Purdue doesn't seem to be as diverse as other schools where I've been accepted to (but it's the best by far). 

I'd like to know if there is some kind of racism towards Latinos (I'm from South America). I have never experience racism in my life (I'm considered "white" where I come from, but I'm definitely not white according to "world standards") so I'm kind of worried about this. 

Is there something I should be aware of when interacting with faculty, students (I'm gonna be a TA) or locals?

First Year Engineering or UIUC Pre Engineering?
I’m so confused and only have about a week left to commit. I’ve heard many bad things about Pre Engineering, and EE requires a 3.75 GPA, which from what I heard is very difficult. FYE only requires a 3.2 minimum for all majors (based on what I’ve heard), and Purdue costs only a few thousand more. Can I get some advice on this?

CS352, 448, and 407. Is this doable?
Hello CS students, I'm building a schedule for my last semester here and I'm asking if these three courses together would be a manageable workload? Otherwise I feel I should just be doing 352 and 448 and go part-time, then leave 407 for the Spring. (please dont tell me to do 354 instead)

EDIT: These will be the only classes I will be taking for the semester

I wanna go for the one which will be easier in terms of workload mainly, but also better grading system or profs.

Recruiting for a Nutrition Study ($300 Compensation)
Hi everyone - I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Nutrition Science. We're currently recruiting for a research study. The purpose of the study is to determine how different amounts of red meat in a balanced diet may influence changes in health. Our list of exclusion criteria is quite long but if you are between the ages of 30 - 69, have a BMI between 25 - 37 kg/m2, and are a non-smoker, you may be eligible to participate. 

Broadly - the study itself involves following two different healthy controlled, weight-stable diets (not weight loss) for 5 weeks a piece where we will provide all foods. We will ask you to come in for a health testing day at the beginning and end of each diet where we will take your weight, a blood draw, and administer questionnaires. At the end of the study, you will be given $300 dollars for your participation.

If you'd like more information, please email me at: [rbergia@purdue.edu](mailto:rbergia@purdue.edu)

Multiple Finals on the Same Day
I was wondering if the policy to be able to reschedule an exam if you have 3 finals on the same day still applies to distance learning students? I have 3 finals scheduled on the same day, but they're all online. Two of the finals also give me a 24 hour time window, so although it's inconvenient for me to take an exam the next day right before the exam window closes, I'm not sure if my professors will consider a request to reschedule an exam. Would it still be worth it try to request to reschedule an exam and see?

Breadth Requirement for ECE / any kind of engineering students
Heya guys :D

Returning Junior, and I was searching options for the Breadth Requirement for my Engineering department. Any good advice on which courses I should take? 

Due to the harsh GPA Purdue provides, I would wish to take it outside of Purdue (online).

(Would rather end up with a PASS than a C or B at most)

So yup! The courses are:

 **AAE** 20300 or

**BME** 20100 or

**CHE** 20500 or

 **CE** 29700 or 35000 or 35300 or 35500 or 

**EEE** 35500 or 

**IE** 33500\* or 33600 or 

**MSE** 23000\* or 

**ME** 20000\* or 27000\* or 41300 or 

**NUCL** 20000\* 

&#x200B;

\*\* Heard that students indicate taking ME 200 outside of Purdue to be relatively easy, but is it? Where should I consider taking it at?

&#x200B;

Thanks so much :D

I have read over [https://engineering.purdue.edu/ENE/Academics/Undergrad/FYE/EAI](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ENE/Academics/Undergrad/FYE/EAI) but I just wanted some clarifications

Am I wrong or is this correct?

CS questions

* Does Purdue have weed out classes? Can they be managed if you have some prior coding experience / AP CS A knowledge?
* What is the average class size in CS?
* What is the graduation rate for CS?
* What resources are available to students who are struggling in their classes and need academic support?
* What tech companies recruit at Purdue?
* Are most people able to find internships after 2nd/3rd year?
* Given that CS enrollment is around 500 students, is there much competition for internships? How do students set themselves apart?

So I go to check alternatives for it that my advisor game me and shocker! There arent any. I’m just mad because why would you not get a class that you put as number one on your CRF and thats required for you. Anyways I gotta meet with my advisor now but screw batch scheduling. Ok rant over.

M1 Macbook Air OK for ChemE?
I have a friend that is going to be an incoming freshman at Purdue for Chemical Engineering. I'm posting for them because they don't really know much about reddit. Anyway, would an M1 Macbook Air be fine for a ChemE? What's the extent of the programs and computing that they will need--or is Matlab it? I assume it would be far less than say, a mechanical engineering major. I know that in the past, students have just used Virtual Machines and stuff, but I read that those solutions may not work best or be optimized now that the M1 is ARM based. 

Thanks ahead of time.

Data Science- Purdue
Hi, I was recently admitted to Data Science and am strongly considering attending Purdue. I have some questions and concerns though about the program.

1. Is it smart to add a double major in Applied Stats with DS? Will this make graduating in four years very difficult?  


2. Are DS students finding jobs/getting good internships for DS?  


3. With the new CODO/transfer rules making adding a double major in CS impossible, is it a good idea to add a CS minor to get some knowledge on systems?

4. Outside of the Datamine, what other data science/analytics oriented research opportunities are there on campus?

5. Do employers recognize Purdue Data Science name?

6. Do DS students get guaranteed space in CS coursework?

Thanks,

Ece Senior Design VIP vs 477
I am conflicted on choosing between doing the 2 semester VIP senior design or taking 477 for 1 semester. I am particularly interested in the SoCET team and am currently signed up for normal research on the team for 1 semester, but am debating if I should switch to the full senior design option instead of doing 477. If anyone has experience in either of these I'd love to hear your options.

I know they are different fields as the 477 is an embedded systems project whereas the VIP obviously deals with SoCs. I am slightly more interested in SoCs but I also have more experience with them than embedded so it's hard to say.

Also, needing a team of 4 and a good idea for 477 is a little daunting because not a lot of people I know are taking it, however I'm willing to do it if it's that much better of an experience.

So I just got my schedule and I’m pretty okay with it but i wish that I didn’t have an 8am class every day. I’ve never really messed with my schedule but I hear you can change things around with open registration.
My question is if I try to do open registration will I lose my current classes? I don’t want to try modifying things and then end up in a worse spot. I generally don’t really understand how open registration works anyways either haha. Do you do it through the course requests or is it a different program?
--------------------------------------------------
Is it still possible to change a major required course to pass/no pass for this semester?
I know this is a thing for last semester but I'm not sure if this still applies. I feel like I might get a c in cs 240 and I dont want it to ruin my gpa.

Whats the time ticket for registration?
Is it just when the registration opens? I’m just comfused bc i got an email about having to re-register my courses during my time ticket and im not sure what the tome ticket actually is lol.

AAE sophomore scheduling issues
The tentative schedule came out, and I am required to take AAE 203 for my major. I was accepted into AAE (conditionally), but on scheduling assistant it has these classes crossed out, and says that they are no spaces available. Does anyone else have this issue? I don't know how this could have happened.

How is the economics program here?
I’m a junior in high school currently looking at college and am interested in economics. I want to go to law school after I graduate and am interested in an economics degree for undergrad but don’t know how good the program here is. How does it compare to IU? I know Purdue is mainly known for engineering but does it also have good programs for economics and business?

COM 300 & Up Class Recommendations?

Ap exams for credit at Purdue.
I’m a senior in high school and am super excited for school to be done. Basically the only thing left is a few projects and so exams. I have human geography, physics 1, macroeconomics, seminar, and statistics. I have to do really good on the exams to get a class credit. I’m listing below what ap exam and what class credit I get for what certain scores. 


Human Geography - EAPS 12000 - 4 or 5 

Physics 1 - PHYS22000 - 5 

Macroeconomics - 1xxxx - 3, 4, or 5 

Seminar - 1xxxx - 3, 4, or 5 

Statistics - STAT 30100 - 4 or 5 

I’m going into FYE as a freshman in hopes to major in mechanical engineering and minor in management and computer science. 

What exams, if any, should I really try for and is there a point at all for trying in the macro and seminar exam? I’m still a bit confused as to what exactly 1xxxx. 

I hope I’m not asking for too much and thank you for taking the time to reading all this.
--------------------------------------------------
Social Life
Hi! I was wondering about the social life at Purdue. From what I read on here, frat parties seem more exclusive. Are people in Greek life usually contained to only that group or do they have another friends that they go out with. Also how competitive is sorority rush and does having it in the fall semester make it harder to meet non Greeks

ECON 461 Industrial Organization - Mazur
I am a business econ minor and need one more class to complete it, what class would you recommend? I am also thinking about taking ECON 461 with Mazur as the prof, what are your thoughts? Good class? good prof? should I take the class? what's the course load like?

What about ECON 380 Money and Banking with Holland? I personally think he is dry and monotone from 301 but he might be better at 380... idk lol 

What about ECON 385 Labor Economics with Miguel Sarzosa?
--------------------------------------------------
AAE 575 Experiences?
It sounds like a really interesting class and I'm considering taking it instead of STAT 511 to fulfill my AAE electives requirement. I don't want my workload to be too heavy though. I'll also be taking AAE 418, AAE 450, AAE 554, and EAPS 105. I've never taken a stats class before and feel like I probably should, but I just can't help but be really interested in 575 and this fall is the only time I can take it.

Pokémon Card Trading
Anyone on campus looking to trade some cards?

I have a bunch of doubles from shining fates (and some other older sets), and would love to chat and set up trades, since I’m not a big fan of mailing cards

I’ve heard that there’s a card club, but don’t think they do much Pokémon card stuff...
--------------------------------------------------
No Classes
So, something's wrong. I submitted my course requests way before the deadline but looking now it seems as if none of them got finalized. I still see all the courses in the pre-registration screen, but evidently I didn't finalize or something because I am not registered for anything. Currently, 3 of my courses are filled. I have never run into any problems scheduling (I'm going to be a Junior) and didn't anticipate any this semester. Is there anything I can do about this?

&#x200B;

My filled courses are CS 379, EAPS 112, and COM 217. These all seem pretty popular, I doubt I'll get an open spot. Honestly, I've been super stressed with finals prep and everything, this is not something I needed right now. Is there any hope or will I have to register as a part time student next semester?

going into bme from fye next semester, need help with choosing which classes/professors to take
these are the courses and professors I have: 

BIOL 230 Bartlett, BME 201 Solorio

BME 290 Linkel

BME 295 (Lab) Linnes

BME 295 (Intro to biomechanics analysis) Nauman

CHM 255 Parkinson (not taking the lab component though, so I might replace with PHIL270)

I am also planning to take CS 159 in the summer. 

Does anyone have any recomendations for these classes and/or these professors? Should I not take a specific class/ replace it with a different one? change a professor that I was assigned? any advice at all would be extremely helpful, even about the classes themself and how to do well in them! thanks in advance.

Reposting because I still don’t have a roommate!

Hi! I’m going to be an RA next year in McCutcheon, and the building we’re in has been identified as a place for RAs to potentially have roommates. I don’t really want to be a senior placed with a random freshman because that seems very awkward. If you are living on campus next year, you can sign up to be my roommate in case UR decides to make us have roommates, and if they don’t make us have roommates, your original contract stays in tact, so you’ll just be placed in the room you originally signed up for. There’s literally nothing to lose! So if you wanna be my roommate, dm me, and we can see if we’re compatible! I’ll also only be here for one semester, so you only have to put up with me in the fall! 

I also have a tv, microwave, mini fridge, coffee maker, and futon already, so if you don’t have any of the college essentials, I have us set up. I usually have a few plants by the windows. I’m generally a moderately clean person. We can hit the bars if you’re 21.

Some stuff about me:
College: Agriculture; Major: agricultural education; Clubs on campus: Episcopal Student Association (Christian), PUDM, Block and Bridle, and the Homesteaders Association

Feel free to share with friends. Thanks!

PSA: AirPod cases at Surplus
I went to the surplus store today for my monthly session of looking at vintage shit. Up near the register they have a display cabinet with some smaller items, including a pile of AirPod cases. It looks like I'm not the only one that habitually loses them 😂

I didn't get the price, but I'm sure these came from students. If you lost your case, check there for a used one!

I just called someone at the Registrar’s office asking about cap and gown return because I keep hearing you return both your cap and gown, I received a red slip saying I must return them, but my package also had a note on the outside and said I can keep the cap. They told me you only need to return your gown 😊 just thought I’d put it out there in case people wanted to decorate their caps, I wasn’t going to until I found out today!

Learning Communities Questions
Hi everyone, I'm a freshman admitted to BBS. I wanted to be part of the psychology and leadership for social change LCs, and I was wondering how to go about answering the questions on the application page. They seemed really serious and definitely would have a huge impact on whether I not get into the LC. I even missed the April 15th priority deadline because I was anxious about answering these in a dissatisfactory way. Do you have any suggestions as to how I can go about answering them? Any cliche things to avoid perhaps? They're related to why I want to join the LC + what leadership is to me and what type of leader I intend to be.  Please help me out a little :) thank you!

The Fees
Anyone else think it's dumb that students get charged things like the student health and wellness fee, even if they don't use the service?

Like I'm hundreds of miles away? Then they say it's part of tuition. Well then, idk, maybe include it in the tuition and be done with it?

Fall 2021 Schedules PSA!
Hello!

I thought that reddit would be the most appropriate place for this so here we go:

If you log onto myPurdue, you can technically see that you have been registered for some courses (by going to "detailed schedule"). However, this is a PSA to say that these registrations are not always final. It may change when official schedules are released at 5 pm EST today (April 21st) but it may not.

Basically, just chill out until 5pm to see the official classes you've been registered for.

I hope you all get into the classes you want/need! :)

MA 261 over Summer
I am currently in a situation where I do not think I'll pass MA 261 this semester. I really don't want to deal with this in the fall, so I was wondering if anyone knows what it's like over summer. Are there any differences besides the shorter amount of time, and is it harder? easier? about the same?

Hey y'all, Purdue for some reason swapped my first and last name and it appears that way when I send emails, open brightspace, etc. I'd like to fix this now before I graduate with the wrong name lol.

Anyone deal with this or know who to contact? Is this an ITAP thing or a Administrative type ordeal?

Incoming international student
Hi everyone.. I'm not sure if this is the place to post about this, but here goes..

I have been accepted to Purdue FYE and I am more than excited to attend.. But being an international student I haven't been offered any scholarships..

Now the cost of Purdue is just over what my family can pay (~$5k over)... 

My question is.. Does Purdue offer decent scholarships to internationals from second year onwards? Because if so.. Even if they are not so large.. It'll be a great help and I could feasibly attend the school.!

Does anyone have any information regarding scholarships available to international students once at Purdue? University wide or departmental (I am accepted to the school of engineering).. Please do let me know

Needing Advice: Should I take PHYS2200 while working an internship this summer?
Title.

A little background info: I'm a junior and I have to take PHYS2200 to graduate. I am incredibly bad at math (I barely passed MA 158 and MA 16010) so I am registered to take the equivalent but slightly easier version of this class at Ivy Tech, which my advisor recommends. I want to take it this summer because I don't want to overload myself during my last fall and spring semester, but I also got an internship for the summer as well. Now I am worried that I won't have time to focus on this class and will have to take it during a normal semester with all my other classes. 

I've heard this class is pretty hell for students with math capabilities like me. For those who have taken this course, do you think it is feasible to both work 40 hours a week and pass the course decently?

Worried about Calc 3. Is it still possible for me to pass?
Im doing really bad in this class, like I thought calc 2 was bad but this class has seriously kicked my butt this semester. I totally screwed up on the 2 midterms (40 on the first one with a 68 class avg, 50 on the second with a 61 class avg) and Im sitting at a 66.5 and the material just keeps getting harder. I wish I had more of a cushion for the final since I know a lot of people's grades drop after it but I need it to make my grade to go up. Plus the exams are all on MyMathLab now and like half of it is free response so I cant even guess on the really tough ones. I know the curve for the class is really good but my TA gives easy quizzes so I feel like it wont be that good for me. Sorry for the rant Im just done with this semester and this class.

TLDR: I have a 66.5 in Calc 3, can I realistically pass the class or should I look into taking it over the summer.

Isn't CS 471 obsolete tech?
As I understand, Machine Learning techniques currently used in industry includes Deep Learning (aka neural networks) as well as classification and regression algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and so on. If you look at a modern ML library such as Tensorflow this is what it supports.

Then there is Artificial Intelligence as it existed in the late 1980's and abandoned in the early 1990's. Terminology like "heuristic search" and "expert systems" and so on are from that era. This is obsolete tech. Nobody uses it today. If you look at the description of CS 47100 it uses programming languages Lisp and Prolog. Nobody in the industry has used Prolog since the early 1990's.

Why is 90's style Artificial Intelligence being taught today?

I may be wrong in my understanding, which is why I am making this post. Can someone who has taken CS 471 explain how this tech is current and/or useful?

Using AP Stat & AP Bio Undistributed Credit for 120 unit graduation requirement
I know the undistributed credit doesn't count toward major/minor/university-core requirements.

Now new advisor is saying I can't even use it for 120 unit requirement.

Anyone else has experience with this? Thx.

ME acceptance
How many applicants are there to ME in a typical year? I just read that around 350 FYE students are accepted each year, and for a class size of probably over 2000 engineers I’d imagine a lot of people don’t get in. What are the chances of me getting Mechanical if I don’t manage to get the 3.2 gpa within both my engineering core classes and overall gpa that guarantees acceptance if there is space? Right now it’s looking like I’ll be around a 3.4-5 overall gpa and more like a 3.1 in engineering specifically because I royally fucked my calc 2 grade on the last 2 exams. Thanks!

Your thoughts on the Sister Cindy event? (my opinion/rant-ish)
Curious to know everyone's thoughts. I personally didn't go because I didn't want to be a part of a group that was giving preachers the attention and platform they are seeking to say horrible things. But to my surprise there were loads of students present there (some not wearing masks but that's another story on its own).

I know I have a pretty unpopular opinion because many people found it entertaining and I personally don't see what's so entertaining about homophobia or shaming people in general.

Also, I know there were also people who were being disrespectful towards Cindy and now I know that when you say horrible things, you're opening yourself up to all the criticism, but Cindy is free to have opinions of her own and if you live in a country that takes pride in having freedom of speech, then you have to pay the price of accepting opinions like Cindy's. Don't be disrespectful, it doesn't make you a better person. If you can't listen to opinions like that, just leave it. It's not worth your time or energy.

I'm just curious and wanna know what everyone else thought. If someone has opposite opinions from me, feel free to share! I'm genuinely open to hearing varying opinions about this and I'm always happy to learn more :)

Edit: Thanks y'all for sharing your thoughts. Glad we could have conversations on this w/o being disrespectful and spreading hate. Hope you're having an awesome day!

People who are doing well in MA261 this semester
Could you please share your study tips? I normally review the hw and watch boilerexam videos. I do well on the hw/quizzes but keep on getting crappy midterm grades. I really need to pull through on the final. Thank you!

I need to shoot a video that will need some space to shoot indoors. Does anyone have suggestions/ideas of where I could shoot on campus?

CS 177 Online
Hello,

I am planning on taking CS 177 asynchronous this summer. Can anyone give me some insight on the course regarding the online version? I can’t find any of the past syllabus for the class. How are exams formatted?
