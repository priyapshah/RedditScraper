Grading Question
I'm currently in a history course where there are 4 assignments: two midterms worth 25% of my final grade each, and two essays where one is worth 15% and one is worth 35%. I have so far taken one midterm and completed two essays, and I got an A on the midterm and an AB on both essays (NOTE: I was not given a number value grade, instead I just got a letter grade).

I was just wondering if I got an A on the last midterm, would I finish the course with an A or an AB? I would have 50% of my grade be an A and 50% be an AB, so does that round to an A or an AB? I was just curious because my last midterm for the course is due Monday, and if I can't get an A in the class I'm not gonna go full throttle on the final midterm, especially with 2 more exams right on the horizon.

Social engagement panic attacks.
As I think about returning to in-person classes I am little worried about how estranged I will forever be because of my LD and because I am a non-traditional student. With classes online, I felt I was better able to tailor my interactions with folks, but when we return to in-person classes, I fear I will be reliving some of the worst years in my life all over again. It took me a while to surround myself in a tight network of decent hardworking people, and they make me better every time we spend time with one another. I don't know I will be able to keep float in a sea of some 35k+ students who might judge me or perceive me as something I do not see myself as. I am not a perfect person, but I am not sure I am how people see me. I just do not think I can really take the criticisms that will surly haunt me when we come back to school. It's going to be an sensory overload for people like me.

Professor Won‚Äôt Tell Students If the Final Exam Will Be Honorlocked or Not
I‚Äôm in Physics 202 right now and my professor is being very vague about the format of the final exam no matter how many questions his students ask him about it. We know that it‚Äôs a Webassign with 30 questions, but he won‚Äôt tell us if it‚Äôs going to be proctored using Honorlock or not. 

First question: Is it normal/okay for a professor to be so vague and not be clear about the format of the final exam so close to the date (said he may tell us the day before)? 

Second question: Can you even honorlock a Webassign?

Thanks!

How will my fall semester be? (Computer engineering schedule)
I'm taking Gen Bus 310, CS 400, and ECE 203, 210, and 219.  How hard should I expect the semester to be?  It's only 13 credits, but I know credit count for a course can be a pretty bad indicator of how hard it is.  Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------
How important will Physics 202 be for computer engineering?
I am about to finish the class and it has been a pretty bad experience.  Will what I have been doing in Physics 202 be very similar to the rest of my computer engineering classes?  I have loved CS 200/300 and ECE 252, in contrast.

Clubs/activities/how tf to make friends during the summer?
nearly all of my housemates, my partner, and most of my friends are going home this summer. I already have a job but it‚Äôs not really one where I have an opportunity to meet new people.

The midterm is canceled so the final is worth 60% of my total grades. And there are 3 problems in the final, so each worth 20% of my total grade. It is my only and last exam as an undergrad here. I keep having nightmares of messing it up and fail to graduate.

You can swipe left on a Duo notification and approve it right from the lock screen on iPhone?!
Maybe I'm just dumb, but I realized just last week after a year+ of having to use Duo that you can just swipe left on a notification and a menu pops up to approve it right from your lock screen instead of having to go into the app every time. Just thought I would post this for any other dummies out there who didn't realize this earlier!

Can you get accepted into a language house not knowing the language?
I really wanna go to the international learning community and to a language house, either Norden or the German one. That being said I don‚Äôt speak either German or Norwegian/Swedish/Danish. The form had all these questions in these languages and I wasn‚Äôt able to answer them. I wanna go to those because I intend on learning the language and immersing myself there, though I don‚Äôt have those skills yet. 

Is it possible to get into these? Or will I be rejected instantly? Also do they increase your chances of getting into the international learning community? What are your chances of getting into the community to begin with? Why does the Norden house want me to apply for a stipend fund?

Any LOTR fans here? Here‚Äôs some motivation from Aragorn for finals.

Hold your ground! Hold your ground! Badgers of UW Madison... of Madtown... my friends!

 I see in your eyes, the same fear that would take the heart of me! 

A day may come when the courage of badgers fail, when we forsake our studying and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this week! 

A week of gophers and failed exams when the age of badgers comes crashing down... but it is not this week! 

This weekend we study! 

By all that you hold dear, in this great city, I bid you STAND, BADGERS OF UW MADISON!!

Art 100, 102, 107
Hello,

I am planning on taking an art class this summer. The problem is I'm not sure if I should take Art 100, 102, or 107. Could anyone who has taken the classes explain the difference between them?

Also for 102 and 107 I am a little concerned about the workload. They are both 3 credit classes that are taught in about a month while Art 100 spans over 2 months. I am already working full time this summer so I don't want to be spread myself too thin.

Thank you!

What Dorms have the highest concentration of Redditors? (survey)
Hey y'all, 

Out of sheer fucking curiosity, I had the urge to figure out which dorms had the largest concentration of people that frequent this subreddit. I plan to achieve this statistic by sending out this google form (link below) and then proceed to find the amount of people each building can hold and then divide that number to figure out the "Redditors per capita" for each of the dorm buildings (or i will just send out the statistics I receive).

Here's the link!

Summer term financial aid
So summer financial aid is given after you enroll in summer classes. I enrolled in 4 summer classes (12 credits) and got a certain amount for summer financial aid. But I dropped a class and now only have 3 classes (9 credits), so will my financial aid change? I would be a half-time student (>6 credits).

Language Placement Testing?
Incoming freshman here. If I fulfilled the language requirements for my major in high school, do I need to actually take a placement test or is the class on my HS transcript sufficient?

Specifically, the Computer Science (BS) major requirements page says I need to "complete the third unit of a foreign language" where a unit is one year of high school work. I took Spanish all 4 years in high school. Do I need to sign up for the Spanish placement test if I don't want to take Spanish at UW?

Who do I contact for a dispute over due dates with a professor who I‚Äôm afraid of?
Sorry for the long post, but I need some advice. 
Tldr at the end.

I‚Äôm not sure exactly how to handle this situation, but I figure someone on here might. This morning, I saw that the due date for a final paper I have was two days earlier than I thought (from May 5th to May 3rd). However, in the syllabus, the due date was still May 5th. I emailed my professor and asked which was the right due date. He replied that the syllabus stated that it was due the 3rd (it did not). I screenshotted two different places that said it it was due the 5th and sent that to him. He replied that his view of the syllabus said the 3rd. 

At this point, I would have just left it at that and taken the L, but when I went back to look at the syllabus later that afternoon to see if there was any other places that said one date over the other, he had changed the due date to say the 3rd (in the same sections that I had screenshotted from earlier), and sent no follow up email to his students. 

To me, this really seems like he‚Äôs not owning up to his mistake, and I feel that other students may suffer by turning the assignment in on the wrong day. 

I‚Äôm planning on turning the essay in on the 3rd just so that I don‚Äôt get a bad grade, and I understand that he has the final say on the due date, but I feel like I‚Äôm not the only one who probably had the deadline as the 5th written down somewhere.

However, I am afraid to bring this up to him as his rate my professor says he was almost fired for being ‚Äútoo mean‚Äù, and his syllabus says a ‚Äúbad attitude will make you fail the class‚Äù. I do not want him to retaliate and fail me as I have an A in the class as it stands, and I need this class for my certificate. He is also the department chair for this certificate, so I can‚Äôt contact them. This is also not the first time his assignments were posted with incorrect due dates. 

Now for my questions; do I bring it up with student affairs/some other office as he is very obviously trying to cover up his mistake and other students may suffer because of it? The overarching department is the art department (he is not a chair there), would it be better to bring it up to them? I don‚Äôt want other students to get a failing grade on the paper, and it seems like he will not be acknowledging this mistake by sending a correction email. I do not want to email him to say something, I‚Äôm afraid of him, and afraid of him failing me for no real reason. What do I do? 

Tl;dr 
professor made a mistake on the due date of a final paper, refused to acknowledge the mistake when I asked and sent screenshots, then went back and secretly ‚Äúfixed it‚Äù so it would seem like he didn‚Äôt make a mistake, and didn‚Äôt update the class. I‚Äôm afraid of him, so I don‚Äôt know who to bring this up to, but I‚Äôm afraid other students will turn the assignment in on the wrong date.

Urgent: Accepted Admission But Housing Contract Is Locked
Hello. I just accepted my admission to UW-Madison and paid the deposit fee. I have the ‚ÄúThank you for confirming your enrollment...‚Äù message. However, the ‚ÄúComplete residence hall housing contract‚Äù tab is still locked because it says I still need to confirm my freshman enrollment. There is nothing left for me to do to confirm my freshman enrollment, but it says it‚Äôs incomplete. Am I missing something, or does it just take a long time to process? (It‚Äôs been about 30-40 minutes)

Thank you very much!

2 final exams on the same day
Hey! So two of my courses have final exams on the same day during fall 2021. One is 10:05 AM to 12:05 PM and then another one 12:25 PM to 2:25 PM. Is this doable or will the only 20 min break just kill me in the exams?

physics 103 final exam rant.
Physics 103 exams have been unfair. Low amounts of questions that are worth a ton of points. No partial credit and no curve. 

To study for the final we were given three practice exams, but when we take them they lock the quiz so we can‚Äôt see what we got wrong. 

Also, the answer key doesn‚Äôt match. Some numbers are different, and for some problems the complete problem is different. 

Not to mention, there are no TA‚Äôs at the help desk. 

How do they expect us to study?

one-semester off-campus housing contract?
I know a one-year contract for the housing is normal, but does anyone know the places that allow signing a lease for just one semester? I tried to find a Fall 2021 sublet on fb sublet group, but it seems there's no availability. if you can tell any place or option, I would highly appreciate it!

Summer Term Course Load
For those who have taken courses during the summer before, how is the workload? Right now I have curric 277, stat 324 and comp sci 354 on my list, but I'm worried about if I can manage them at the same time, since what usually takes a whole semester to teach is now squeezed into two months. I probably won't have anything else going on (internships, etc.), so it's just this vs free time.

E C E 210 Instructors
I'm creating my schedule for next fall and ECE 210 is one of the courses I have to take. There are two professors available and they're Daniel Ludois and Hongrui Jiang. I couldn't find anything online about Prof. Ludois so I'm not sure, and Prof. Jiang's reviews are mostly negative.

&#x200B;

Does anybody have experience with either of them?

Easy intermediate level courses?
Hey all, I'm an incoming CS transfer student. To graduate on-time, I need a few more of my classes to cover the Depth of Intermediate/Advanced work requirement. Ideally, I'd like these courses to also satisfy some of the L&S Breadth requirements, but because I'm new to UW I'm not sure what classes would be smart to take for this. If you guys could give me some ideas, I'd appreciate it!

J201 honors assignment
I really hate how the honors course has been handled for j201....

there's literally no information on canvas other than the due dates and when I went to my professor to talk about it more, he acted like I was wasting his time. I submitted my first draft a little over a week ago and haven't heard anything back from him. 

I talked to my TA and he didn't seem to know either. I'm stressed because it was just my first draft, but I don't really want to ask my professor at the same time because last time I did, he was rude to me ("why are you asking me this"). 

Does anyone have any past experience on the honors assignment/research paper for j201??

AHHHH what should I do for housing?!
I have the option to resign my place I am subleasing at, but it will cost about 1050 a month total for me, I pay about 800 a month total right now as a subleaser. (I have to sign by tomorrow night!) 

I cannot sign into a different lease myself, so I would have to wait for a potential sublease to come up by august.

Otherwise, I could do the Zoe Bayliss Co-Op.

Please give me advice, I am having a breakdown almost LOLLLL.

Taking two Comm B courses?
I‚Äôm currently enrolled in History 201 and English 140, for a history certificate and literature gen ed. I had heard good reviews of these classes, and I didn‚Äôt think that there was any significance to taking two Comm B courses. 

After talking to my advisor, though, he warned me that taking two Comm B course would be fairly difficult and writing-intensive. However, I am now extremely limited in options for alternative classes to take (at least in terms of classes that I‚Äôd realistically be interested in taking), so I‚Äôm wondering whether I should drop English 140 at all costs, or just bite the bullet and do the two Comm B courses.

Has anyone taken two Comm B courses at once, and has any words of wisdom on the difficulty of doing so? Also, words of wisdom from anyone who has taken either History 201 or English 140 would be appreciated.

Bars and restaurants near campus?
Has anyone worked at any of the bars or restaurants near campus and had a bad/ good experience? If so why was it bad or good?

If anyone‚Äôs had a great experience outside of those four I‚Äôd take other recommendations.

Preparing for CS 537
I‚Äôm taking CS 537 (and 536) next semester along some gen-eds, about a year and a half after taking CS 354 and want to study a bit over the summer to prepare. 

Would it be better for me to focus on reviewing material from CS 354 and then skimming over parts of the 537 textbook, or skim CS 354 stuff and do a decent amount of reading of the 537 textbook? Either way I‚Äôll be brushing up on my C programming skills.

Student Interested In Sports Business
Hello everyone, I currently have UW-Madison in my final two with just a couple of days until my decision has to be made. I‚Äôm really interested in sports and want to work in the industry one day. I applied as a Sports Management major for many schools, but have since been slightly scared off by the job perspectives. Thus, I‚Äôve become pretty interested in studying some form of business, and hopefully using the degree to get into sports business. 

I was admitted to UW-Madison as a Pre-Business student but will likely switch to Economics if possible, and maybe get a minor (or certificate?) in Business. However, I would still want to be around sports during my time at UW-Madison. I know there is a Sports Communications certificate that is offered that intrigues me, but I‚Äôm a bit confused on what exactly it is, whether it‚Äôs actually attainable for me if I‚Äôm majoring in economics with a certificate in something else, and whether or not it‚Äôs actually worth my time. Besides the Sports Communications certificate, are there any other ways to get involved with sports business on campus? I think there‚Äôs a club...is anyone here in it? Are there any classes that I can take down the line that relate to sports/sports business? Are there athletic department/sports team internships that are offered to students?

Basically, I want a business degree (I know Econ isn‚Äôt technically considered ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù at Wisconsin), but I don‚Äôt want to steer so far away from my true passion (sports) these next four years.

Thank you so much for your time, and go Badgers!

For those in the MSW program, can you do more than 8 hours a day for your internship?

Google search on UW Madison
Hello everyone,

To most this might seem like a trivial thing but I was just googling UW and I couldn't see the usual page we see for universities which includes "Overview, Admissions, Cost, Programs, etc."  Is anyone else facing a similar issue?

To compare, you can google Purdue, Duke, etc and then try googling UW Madison.

who decided they should close half the testing sites a week before the dorms close while still requiring us to keep up on testing?
I‚Äôm in a lakeshore dorm and my roommate noticed that the holt test center closed on the 30th. Okay, fine, we‚Äôll do a saliva test at Dejope. chill. except they‚Äôre closing like half of the testing sites. the closest site is a fifteen minute walk, and from what I‚Äôve heard the wait times at the testing centers that use saliva testing are nightmarish. Who thought that was a good idea during finals week?? ain‚Äôt nobody got time to spare for a half hour round trip to get tested.

Schedule manageability
I‚Äôm hoping to progress this summer to Materials Science and Engineering and I was wondering if someone could tell me if this schedule is an overload. In comparison, I am taking Math 222, Chem 104, Physics 201, and Interegr 170 this semester and I‚Äôm doing solid (except for the physics fiasco).

1. MSE 330 (3 credits)

Is the Wisconsin Experience Summer Launch worth it?
Hi everyone, I‚Äôm an undergraduate freshman who‚Äôs currently admitted for political science. I was wondering if anyone has taken the summer launch program before, and if they have an opinion on it. 

The course I was assigned to (after taking a survey) was JOURN 162 , which is taken along with two separate 4-week seminars. The seminars are: How to Succeed in College,  (focused on learning techniques) and The Wisconsin Experience Seminar (learning more about UW-Madison). 

Personally, I have no study habits so the first seminar interested me as I know I‚Äôll need to learn how to study quickly! Also, the idea of getting 5 credits before even starting is exciting to me. 

Overall, I‚Äôm just looking for opinions on if it‚Äôs worth doing and any information from past students who‚Äôve gone through the program. Thanks!

Question about housing
I was accepted into L & S and am going to be staying off campus. In my New Student To Do List on UW Madison's application portal, there is a residence hall housing contract. Should I just not do this if I'm gonna be staying off campus?
--------------------------------------------------
Question - Off campus housing timeline
Sorry if this has been asked before. I'm moving to UW-Madison this summer as a grad student and wanted to know if there is any specific time in the year when leases start opening up? I can't tell if I'm ahead of the curve right now or way behind. Specifically I'm just looking for studio/1 bedroom apartments if that changes anything. Any tips are much appreciated.

Odds of getting rescinded?
Hey y‚Äôall, I just got admitted into UW-Madison a few weeks ago. I go to boarding school and my grades up until Spring term have been a B average with an occasional C+ here and there. I recently received my midterms and saw that I have a D in one of my classes (this D is bc we‚Äôve only had one assessment and it was my first in person test). All of my other grades are normal for me except this one D. Should I be concerned about getting rescinded? Moreover, should I write to the University explaining my circumstances for receiving this low grade?

Question about Double Majoring
I was admitted as a math student, and am interested in double majoring with CS. 

1) How hard is it to get into the double major for Math and CS? I.e., do many students get into the program who try to apply/declare for it? 

2) How is recruitment? How are the career prospects for students double majoring in Math and CS, at least when compared to some other schools (in particular, UT Austin)? Do many students go to top grad schools for CS/Math? I know UW is highly rated in both departments, but was wondering generally if anybody had any comments on that. 

3) Generally speaking, do students get a lot of flexibility when choosing degrees? Is there a lot of freedom to change (at least early on) and to try to find what you like?

I appreciate any help.
--------------------------------------------------
B Or SD?

Lab Research Assistant
I currently have a lab position set up for the fall, and am interviewing for a research assistant position for this summer that wants me to continue through the fall. 

I'm just wondering is it reasonable to be in two different labs in one semester or is it a bad idea? I've never worked in a lab before so I have no clue how much of a commitment it really is besides the amount of credit hours. Doing both labs would be a total of 4 credits, and I am only taking 12 credits of classes (one of which being a capstone though). Would appreciate any advice at all, thanks!
--------------------------------------------------
There is no reason to hide feedback for exams other than ECE professors being lazy.
Every flipped classroom ECE class I have taken (both covid and non-covid) has administered digital exams taken on a computer. Once you finish the test, it is forever hidden from you. You do not get another opportunity to review it again. All you will eventually see is your score, and that's it. 

The goal of exams is to test a student's knowledge **and provide feedback so they know how to modify their study behaviors to do better next time**. How can any student know how to improve if they can't see what went wrong?

Why do they do this, you may ask? Because ECE professors are lazy. They re-use the same lecture videos, same exercises, and **same exams** every semester because they can't be bothered to write anything new. 

Is anyone else frustrated at this? I am literally begging them to let me study more! I want to know where I went wrong so I can do better later, but I guess the ECE department doesn't care about that.

Freshman living in an apartment?
Hi,

For like the past three years I‚Äôve saved up to get an apartment. I found one on campus but I was wondering if I was screwed on the social aspect? I keep reading about how freshmen should live in dorms to make friends and everything but my reason for getting an apartment was so I can focus on school more. What are the ways I can make some friends if I choose off campus housing?

Is it possible for the Incoming freshman to take Examination in exchange for Calculus credit?
I noticed Maths Department offer [this exam](https://www.math.wisc.edu/undergraduate/calculusexam) to gain credits for Calculus. This cover MATH 221, MATH 222, and/or MATH 234. 

Since AP does not include Multivariable Calculus (MATH 234), the only way for me to gain credit for MATH 234 (without enroll in class) is to take this exam. The website said "in-person credit exams are typically held on the **first day of classes**" . However, at this time, students will have already settled their plans and enrolled in scheduled courses. If I want to enroll in courses that held MATH 234 as Requisites like PHYSICS 311 , what can I do?

Vaccination and Badger Badge
I got my second dose of the vaccine 2 weeks ago and uploaded proof to MyUHS 2 weeks ago as well. I believe my Badger Badge was supposed to turn green today 4/27 and I know it‚Äôs midnight so maybe it‚Äôll change later. 

However, I was wondering when it turns green for those that have been vaccinated? Mine is currently yellow bc I was just waiting it out until it out, so that‚Äôs my bad.

UW-Madison students lost all credibility to complain about covid.
This weekend when walking home from work i witnessed an absolute tragedy.  thousands of students being destructive with no masks and crowded and destroying peoples cars. 

The same people were on this subreddit complaining how the city wont do anything about bars breaking covid rules...  Really you're worried about bars, while thousands of you pack mifflin..

I mean come on.

--------------------------------------------------
Moving forward with Covid
Honest question/rant here. I completely respect and understand people who were super cautious of Covid this year and there's no point of changing that with like two weeks left, but I honestly wonder if going forward some people who are vaccinated, healthy, and young and still won't even see like 5-6 friends are borderline agoraphobic or germaphobic. I've seen students here on twitter talking about how even though they're vaccinated they're still worried seeing a few friends. What are you waiting for at this point? I seriously hope some people can seek help and live a normal life by the fall and we end this ridiculous shame game of those who choose to live their lives normally. Legitimate thoughts? I know reddit is probably such an echo chamber to ask but it's getting ridiculous in some ways. Rant over.

How do I spend all the time I save walking across the street before the walk signal comes up?
Lately I've been feeling frisky and joined the gang of early walkers, daring to do so as soon as the last car zips by, not waiting 1 second for the walk signal to come up.

With all the time I've saved, I've taken 18 credits, triple majored in Biomedical engineering, art history, and physics, and work 3 jobs. I already volunteer for 20 hours a week, and help old ladies climb up Bascom hill on the weekends, but I find I just don't have enough to do. Any suggestions?

If I were to start attending UW Madison, what are some good apartments??? Just so you know I‚Äôm a normal human being. I‚Äôm not rich and I‚Äôm gonna have a heavy course load.

Odds at grad school?
Hi y'all.

I'm a freshman right now hovering around a 2.99-3.0. I'm sure I'll have more time to raise my gpa to something more attractive for grad school, but what do you guys think? Also - if I fail a class and retake it, will only my second grade count?  


edit: I'm doubling majoring in microbio/biochem and looking into medical research. Med school \*might\* be a possibility, but I don't necessarily need it for med research, only if I want to be a practicing physician/researcher at the same time.

Venting About the Economics Program
I am a rising sophomore in the economics program and recently scheduled my classes for next semester and got an idea of what my future semesters might consist of. One of the classes I really want to take is ECON320, which is Investment theory (generally what I want my future career to be). The problem with ECON320 and a bunch of other ECON classes is that they are cross-listed as finance classes and have business school classes as prerequisites. I was planning on applying to the business school in order to double major in finance and econ, but my semester one grades were very poor, meaning I have no chance at the business school. I'm so frustrated that I can't even take a number of classes in my program without either applying to the business school or getting lucky enough to take all of the prereqs (which also add a bunch of almost useless credits to my degree when I could use that time for degree requirements).
--------------------------------------------------

Please let me know your thoughts on both of the classes and professors! Much appreciated.

Guidance for picking Residence Halls.
Hey guys, Freshman of 2025 here,
So since a lot of dorms have undergone changes and pricing etc, I seek guidance on picking out a suitable form for me. Many of the guides I have seen are outdated and it's tough for me to submit my ranked list to UW.

Edit: I'm outgoing and love socialising but do not drink or party ATM. The party thing might change but the alcohol part won't. I don't prefer super quite. I like eventful dorms which also give you peace when you need it.
Current ranked list:

Ogg
Chadbourne
Dejope
Bradley
Witte
Sellery
Smith
Philips
Adams
--------------------------------------------------
Off Campus Housing or Dorm?
Im an incoming junior transfer student and Im curious what the best option to live is. I am choosing between an apartment or house hopefully in the Southeast or a dorm. Id like to live in a dorm like Ogg, but I haven't been sent a dorm contract yet and don't know if there will be any space left. Should I just jump on a house or apartment with some guys im talking to, or wait it out and hopefully get a good dorm that is in the Southeast and be able to meet a lot of people? I just don't want to wait too long and miss out on an off campus place, but I also want to feel apart of campus and meet people.
--------------------------------------------------
Surviving at UW-Madison
so I have been going through a lot of posts and searches online about the academic rigor at UW and its become clear to me that getting a 4.0 is not going to be easy by any means (not that it's easy anywhere else) but I just wanted to ask if there are certain things I could be doing to make smart decisions and if there is anything u wish u had known before starting your freshman year? if you couldn't tell already, yes I am a pre-med looking for insight. Any advice is appreciated.

Prospective Student Questions
Hi.. I am currently a high school junior and researching colleges. I am from New York City area and want to go away for college. UW Madison seems desirable due to its location in Wisconsin‚Äôs capital(my intended major is political science), its vibrant social scene, and good sports and school spirit. I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs pretty competitive to get in OOS(does anyone have truth to that), also I‚Äôve heard there is a lot of rich ‚Äúcoasties‚Äù who seem to go here. Are most people here welcoming and how competitive is sorority rush to get into a house you want? Also does anyone have experience with political science major and the rigor and internships that align with the major? Thank you!

When do the ECE flipped classroom classes stop?
I know a lot of people like flipped classroom. For me personally, I really, really dislike it. Everyone learns differently, and I guess I am not in that majority that benefits from flipped classroom. 

It's not that I do bad in the flipped classes, I just feel like I don't retain/learn as much as I would if the class was structured in a normal way. I like absorbing info by taking notes while being lectured at. I feel way less engaged and hate watching those videos that don't seem to teach me anything. 

Is 340 flipped? At what point do the flipped classroom classes stop?

Thanks

Looking for flexible summer job
Hi everyone!  I‚Äôm hopefully going to have an internship in Madison this summer, and I‚Äôm looking for a part-time job that I can do to earn money on the side.  I‚Äôm not sure yet what hours the internship would take up, so I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has has suggestions for a flexible job that they or someone they knew enjoyed (~20 hrs/week).

Transcripts and jobs

I‚Äôm not coming back to UW. Is there any reason for me to write all these final papers?
Hey yall! After many struggles in college, ups and downs financially, academically, etc. I realized that the path I was on here was not something I‚Äôm passionate about or even really interested in. I‚Äôve been working with animals for about three years now and decided I want to be a veterinary technologist, for which I‚Äôll be leaving UW to be trained at an accredited technical school. I have an education and career plan set now that I‚Äôm ready for and excited about (i.e. no real chance of me wanting to return here later on). These are my last couple weeks here, and the credits from UW do not transfer to where I‚Äôm going. Is there any reason for me to be doing all these finals?

How does the AP credit system work?
According to [this form](https://registrar.wisc.edu/credit-by-exam-2/), students could get credits for AP exams. But, I noticed some courses do not have any content in the columns of "Gen Ed" or "Breadth". So how does these potential awarded credits work? If they cannot be used to satisfy the "Gen Ed" or "Breadth" requirements, what is the meaning of these credits?

i.e. If I plan to major in Chemistry and took AP USH in my high school. According to the form, I could redeem 3 credits for the HISTORY X13 which will not be considered for "Gen Ed" or "Breadth". How will this 3 credits benefit me?

Off-Campus Housing Vs. Residence Hall
Hi guys,

I've got Adams as my residence hall and heard a lot about it through the previous post.

However, after reading all the posts about Apartments, I am now also considering going off-campus. The ones on my list are Lucky (unavailable for this year), Saxony, and Inez for efficiency; studio single room. I like the ones that are furnished!

Just FYI, I am an international student majoring in CMPE. So, I have classes in Engineering Hall, but also in Ingraham hall for Physics and Van Hise hall for Math/Stat.

Any opinions on choosing an apartment over a dorm and on the apartments that I have listed?

&#x200B;

Edit: I am a returning sophomore student so I'm pretty much fine with the "Social" aspect.

CS200 final with Professor Williams?
Hello,

I am taking CS200 with Professor Williams and wonder how was the final exam?

Heard that is is longer but how long is it and how hard is it compares to those 4 module exams?

Anyone took his cs200 on online last semester? 

&#x200B;

Thanks :)

Placement tests
Hi! I just committed to UW-Madison college of letters and science and I had a few questions.
How many of you have already given the placement tests?
Can we not choose courses unless we give the placement tests?
Will the courses be full by the time I give my placement tests?

I plan on taking 4 philosophy classes next semester, is that too much?
I am an economics major who wants to squeeze in a philosophy major next year, so my plan is to take econ 441, philos 565, philos 430, philos 562, and philos 560. I have only taken one philosophy class so far, and that is philos 211. Will this be too difficult?
--------------------------------------------------
Bowman Chem 343
I‚Äôm right on the borderline between a grade cutoff in this class going into the final.

What percent has the A line for this class been at in the past or do I really just need a 89.5%+ to get an A?
--------------------------------------------------
Physics 208/202 Difficulty?
Would starting off in Physics 208/202 without taking 207/201 prior be difficult? I have AP credit for 207/201 but not for 208/202.

Also, is Physics 208/202 generally easier than 207/201?
--------------------------------------------------
Lucky Apartment
Thoughts on Lucky apartments? Im trying to find a place thats around everything since Im a transfer student, and has solid prices. From talking to people it seems Lucky fits that criteria. Is it a solid place, and any other place you'd recommend?
--------------------------------------------------
Final Grade calculation
Hey guys, I have a quick question about calculating the grade that I will need on two finals and was hoping to see if someone could confirm that my thinking is correct. I currently have a 96.28% in a class with two exams left. One exam is a lab exam (3 total) which in total are worth 25% of my grade, the second is a lecture exam (4 total) which is worth 40% of my grade. In order to calculate the grade that I need, I took what percent of my total grade each individual exam is worth (each Lab exam=8.33%, each lecture exam=10%) and as a third variable added my current grade in the class and the weight that it is worth (Current grade= 96.28%, remaining grade left 100%+8.33%=18.33% so 100%-18.33%= 81.67%) I then used this number to calculate what grade on both exams I would need to get in order to get a 90% overall in the class and came to the answer of 62% on each exam in order to end up with a 90% overall. 

I'm hoping someone could confirm that this makes logical sense and that the numbers truly represent what I am assuming that they represent in this problem.

How‚Äôs my Fall Schedule Looking Like?
L I S 202 

Finance 300 with Bulent Parker

Accounting 301 with Matthew Griffith

Accounting 211 with Paul Kimmel/Kristen Fuhermann

Gen Bus 306 


How manageable is this schedule looking? If I also plan on working a part-time job/internship, is this too many credit hours? (in total it‚Äôs a 15 credit schedule). I technically don‚Äôt *need* to take Acct 211 rn, so would it be better to drop it and free up my schedule?
--------------------------------------------------
Living at Saxony
I've mostly decided to rent an apartment at Saxony for the next school year, but I was curious whether anyone could let me know their experience living there, especially in terms of the wifi? From what I can find, people have said it's really slow at times, but I'm not sure if it's as big of a deal as they say (I'm mainly worried because I'm planning to do most of my studying there)
--------------------------------------------------
Where is ENGL 162?
The course search & enroll doesn‚Äôt show where ENGL 162 is being taught and my schedule shows that I have 15 minutes between this class and a class I have in the humanities building.
--------------------------------------------------
Has anyone taken GEOLOGY/ATM OCN 140?
I am wondering how it is, I've looked at the madgrades distributions and the professor (Brad Singer) doesn't have too many rmp reviews.

I just want to take it because it looks interesting but sometimes the classes I sign up for thinking they're going to be fun end up being more trouble than what it's worth lol. just don't want something super time intensive
--------------------------------------------------
BioHouse/Biocore Regrets???
I'm looking to get into biocore in my sophomore year and rn as an incoming freshman I'm thinking about biohouse as a learning Community. My question is that although I wont be taking any bio related courses my first semester is it worth it living in cole with the biohouse members and be a part of it or should I consider getting into biohouse in my sophomore year when I plan on joining the biocore program.

P.s I really want to live in one of the southeast dorms but since biohouse is in cole in lakeshore I want to be absolutely certain if it's the right way to go. My intention of living in biohouse is to access resources and network with people in my field (bio) and set my self up for better opportunities and surround myself with like minded individuals (pre vet, pre med, pre pharm etc)

Do I need new bank?
Hey,

Off-Campus Housing
Hey guys,

I am an incoming transfer student and am looking for some good options for apartments. I would like to live in the southeast side of campus and be around everything going on. I heard the hub could be a good option. Any other places you recommend where UW-Madison students live, and is also around the southeast side preferably?
--------------------------------------------------
Has anyone who got their vaccine at the Nicholas Recreation Center share their experience?
Okay super dumb question I know. But I'm getting my vaccine at the nicholas recreation center tomorrow and I'm a little worried about finding where the vaccines actually are, since it's such a big building? I'm not worried about the vaccine itself just finding where to get it inside the building.

If anyone can share what entrance they went in or if there are clear signs pointing you in the right direction I would really appreciate it. Thank you so much!
--------------------------------------------------
Ogg or the Studio?
Here's the breakdown: my best friend and I are both incoming freshmen, so we decided we could probably room together. I'm an undecided liberal arts and he's going into engineering. We figured that Ogg seems like a pretty central location to both of our majors.

I'm very interested in music (long-time pianist), and so I'd really like to be able to live in a residence hall that will have resources to help me play or even record music. I've heard that some halls have practice rooms or pianos and stuff.

My main question is that if I were to instead get into the Studio LC, would I have access to more resources than if I dormed normally in Ogg?

To extend this question, since I seriously am interested in having access to musical stuff, be it practice rooms or pianos or instruments etc., which residence hall would be best for me? Can you only access stuff inside of your own residence hall? And is there any information available online regarding the resource that each hall has?

Thank you!

Freshmen & Transfer Group Meeting Today
Hey Badgers! For a class project, my partners and I created a special group for Freshmen & Transfer Students to talk over Zoom about stressors and try to problem solve. Feel free to pop in for any amount of time- our session runs from 3-4 pm central today (4/23)! [Here](https://uwmadison.zoom.us/j/95429858173?pwd=MEphZHc4b2I0ZDVJR1hkSWMxOEZZZz09) is the Zoom link

We also created [this website](https://mindovermatterhealth.weebly.com/mental-health-resources.html) with info on all the mental health resources we could find for UW students. All are low or no cost and most are virtual.

Info Systems vs. Comp Sci
Trying to decide whether to stay on pace as an IS major in the B school or switch to CS. Interested in working in a development type role (coding on daily basis) after graduation, but would prefer to learn about business rather than math for my non-programming required classes. Is the IS major limited in terms of programming and development options after graduation? Would adding the CS certificate suffice? Any insight appreciated

Another enrollment rant
I know we‚Äôre getting a lot of these, but oh. My. God. My enrollment time was at 6:15am today. i tried to enroll at that time but it wouldn‚Äôt let me because the website sucks and doesn‚Äôt work when it needs to. I tried to enroll for an hour until I gave up and decided to try again later. Tried again at 10am and it was working, but one of my classes (chem 104) is completely filled up. Note, that every single section was open when I should have been able to enroll. I really need to take this class, so I put myself on the waitlist but I‚Äôve heard you have better luck emailing the professor? Except, the professor isn‚Äôt listed for some reason (no instructor is), so I have no idea who to email. Any suggestions?

Pre-med at UW-Madison?
Hey! So I have looked all over Reddit trying to get a comprehensive idea on whether UW-Madison would serve as a good school for pre-med and could not find anything beneficial.

So to those who are currently on the pre-med track or any UW-Madison alum could you give me an idea on whether UW-Madison is a school that has great resources (like MCAT prep classes, mock interviews, writing workshops for med school applications), vast amounts of curricular opportunity (shadowing, volunteering, clinical experience, and research), a good GPA reputation, and has medical school placement assistance (how good is the Center for Pre-Health advising?)

Also, would you recommend attending UW-Madison for pre-med in your experience, or would another school be better? (cost is not an issue)

I do understand that I as a student must actively seek out all of this and that it will not be handed out and that my ability to get into medical school is up to me and not the school. I am also aware that pre-med is not a major.

Additionally, I have emailed both the University and the Center for Pre-Health advising but I could not get clear and good answers.

Any scholarships or student work that can help pay off tuition? (56k tuition)(Out of state student)(Transfer Student)
Hey everyone! I was recently admitted to UW-Madison as a transfer and due to my financial situation, there's almost no way I can afford 38k a year + rent for a whole year. Wisco has been my number one ever since I was little and I really want to attend. Does anyone know of any full-tuition or any sort of scholarships that can significantly help pay off my tuition for the next three years? I'm a first-generation student out-of-state student that comes from a low-income family.

CS 400 Group
Hi,

Math 222 Curve?
I‚Äôm taking Math 222 (with Professor Spagnolie) right now and I have a 72% in the course and I just got a 50% on exam 4. I‚Äôm really stressing about my grade because I need to keep it above a 70% (C) (so I can pass/fail with a SD) but depending on which problems they grade the work on, my grade could fall quite a bit. I was looking around the subreddit too and I saw some conflicting things about curves in the past. Does anybody have an idea on what I should expect (if anything) for a curve?

Is it hard to find someone to sublease an apartment over the summer?
debating on getting a 12 month lease that would be cheaper if I leased it for the summer (Quisling Terrace), or getting a 9 month lease just for the school year at a diff place

The 9 month lease would be about $13,000 for the year, and the 12 month would be $15,000 but only $11,000 if I was able to successfully sublease it for 3 months

I just don't want to play myself and am wondering if I should just do the 9 month lease lol. i waited too long, so i don't have many pet friendly options left

Enrollment Rant
What the fuck is wrong with the enrollment process at UW. I have never heard a student from another college have these issues. I‚Äôm going into my sophomore year and of all my first choice classes, backup classes, and backup backup classes, the only one i am guaranteed into is chem 104. literally waitlisted for everything else. even the gen ed‚Äôs i need to finish are full and at this point i just don‚Äôt know what to do. i know i need to enroll in something in case i don‚Äôt get off the waitlists but i don‚Äôt even know. Stat 371, a class i thought wouldn‚Äôt be difficult to get into, is completely full. I‚Äôm a declared Psych major and not a single psych breadth class i haven‚Äôt taken yet is open. i‚Äôm so frustrated with this to the point where i don‚Äôt even want to go to school here anymore.

Can I go through ECE and/or CS without Linear Algebra?
I know it‚Äôs a big component of AI/ML but can I just get along without a formal course on Linear Algebra?

If not, should I go for Math 320/340 or are there other options specific to ECE/CS?

Edit: I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôs not a degree requirement, and the advanced classes I‚Äôm looking into do not require it as a pre requisite, but many of them discuss the concepts to some extent. So would it be better to squeeze the class, or just rely on those classes to give me the info I need.

Transfer Housing and General UW Madison Life
Hey guys,

&#x200B;

I just got into UW Madison as a Junior transfer student, and I was curious as to where you think the best place is to live.  Do most students live on campus? Is there junior housing? Should I just go on a facebook group and look for students to live with off campus? Just trying to find the best place to meet people and feel involved on campus, while also having my own room and space.

&#x200B;

 Also, as a side note, is it hard to meet people as a transfer student coming in with people already having their friend groups? And would you say its necessary to join a frat if I want to go out on the weekends? Or are most parties inclusive?

Freshman Housing Dilemma + Questions
Hello!

I recently committed to UW Madison in L&S (hoping to go into Computer Science) and I'm super excited! However, I'm nervous and unsure about what my housing situation should be. I checked the megathread on information about each dorm, but I still have a few questions.

First, I am unsure if I should go into a single (maybe at Smith? Ik unlikely to get one) or double room. I enjoy participating in social events and I am generally a very outgoing person. I value a good sizeable living space and alone time a lot to get my coursework done. Should I consider a single room, or just go to the library if I need space and time to study?

Additionally, I was thinking of going to Witte or Sellery, but I want to make sure I can focus on my studies. From the things I've heard, Witte/Sellery are very fun - party oriented schools, but can be choas at times. Would those schools impact sleep too much? Otherwise, Smith and Oog look good, but I'm not sure if they will be social enough to enjoy in my freshman year.

&#x200B;

My list:

1. Smith - Single
2. Ogg - Double
3. Witte - Double
4. Sellery - Double
5. Waters - Double
6. Dejope - Double
7. Leopold - Double
8. Kronshage - Double

&#x200B;

Thank you so much for the help and I hope to see y'all on campus!

Question about UW Makerspace
For those of you who 3d printed something either this semester or last semester, how do they check if you're doing a personal project or not?

I need to get a few parts 3d printed, and the only printers available right now are at the Makerspace. I have a blue permit, but their website is saying they're not allowing personal projects.

Hopefully they relax the restrictions over the summer, but I'd prefer to get the parts asap as otherwise I'd have to pay another semester of materials fees to print something once.

Can I get away with saying my parts are for a class or no?

5 minutes to get to class
I have an issue. I really want to take these two courses, but they're spaced apart with 5 minute passing time. I was going to email both professors and explain to them my situation. Does it look really bad to leave 5 min. early for one and show up 5 min late for another?

Is 15 minutes enough between classes?
I‚Äôm having a ton of trouble making my schedule. I haven‚Äôt had my enrollment day yet and classes are all filling up so I‚Äôm having an extremely tough time figuring this out. Is a 15 minute gap between classes enough time to make it from one class to another? I haven‚Äôt been on campus yet so i have no idea where anything is and all of the classes say ‚Äúroom pending‚Äù so I‚Äôm not even able to map out the buildings.

One of my history professors got his doctorate at Madison and shared something y'all might find funny
Last night, he was telling his story about leaving Iran because of the revolution as the last lecture of the semester. He loudly declared Madison is "The Berkeley of the Midwest" in a French-Iranian accent and told us about getting harrassed by townies while drunklenly carrying an armload of sandwiches down Gilman St during the Iran Hostage Crisis.

Ngl, if Madison is anything like Missoula, Montana, I'm definitely gonna apply for grad school. Madison sounds lit.

Also apparently your chapter of my fraternity got shut down for checking a TV off a balcony. That's badass.

Incoming freshman... I have some questions!
I was accepted to UWM a month ago and it‚Äôs been one of my top choices for college as decision day nears. One hesitancy is that I feel like I might not fit in. I‚Äôm coming from the East Coast and Asian American background, and I was wondering what the experience (positive or negative) has been like for current Asian students or alumni‚Äôs? East Coast to Midwest cultural shocks? 

I‚Äôm also not really much of a party goer and the party scene and Greek life seems to be a large emphasis towards making friends and contribute to the college experience. I was wondering if everyone at UWM is into that scene, or are there folks of all niches who maybe also just chill at home or study? 

Lastly, are there any cons of attending UWM? Things you wish you knew before attending? 

If anyone has any insight, advice or tips on any of these topics, please let me know! :)

Advice for Sophomore Lab Involvement
I‚Äôm a rising sophomore in the CoE and I‚Äôm on track to progress into BME. I‚Äôm super interested in getting involved in ways other than joining clubs, such as working in a lab or doing research. Does anyone have any advice on this type of involvement, such as where to look and how to score a position like this? I understand I‚Äôm only a rising sophomore, but I‚Äôm super excited to start gaining experience, even if it‚Äôs just helping out in a basic way in a lab. Anyone have experience with this and can provide personal anecdotes too? Thanks!

Are students able to grab items from donations from university housing at the end of the semester?
So I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of emails about housing residents donating items after the end of the semester that you might not want to take back home with you. My question is, are other housing residents allowed to take items from the donation area if they‚Äôve been left there? If they are going somewhere specific and the university doesn‚Äôt want students going through them I totally get and respect that, but if there are items available for free that I could really use, it would be a cool thing to take advantage of.

Transfer student group chats?
Hi, I was wondering if there were any existing group chats for Fall 2021 transfer students. If not, I'd be willing to create one if people are interested. Thanks!!

BOTANY 123 or ENTOM 205?
I‚Äôm a CS major (sophomore this fall) looking for an easy 3 cr biological science course. Any insight from those who‚Äôve taken any of these courses are greatly appreciated!

Personally I don‚Äôt mind if the content is boring, just looking forward to getting an A.

BOTANY 123 (Professor Rakotondrafara) has 1 in-person lecture & 1 in-person lab.

ENTOM 205 is a hybrid course with 1 in-person lecture.

I‚Äôm not super sure of the workload of either of these courses (especially ENTOM 205 since it‚Äôs hybrid), so any info helps! Thank you :)

Anyone know if taking math 234 and math 320 at the same time is fine
I'm just looking at the engineering flowchart and I'm seeing that these 2 courses are taken 1st semester as a sophomore. I would prefer to take only 1 math course per term so I don't easily fall behind.

Park Terrace West
Hi! So I really like the Park Terrace West Apartments and I signed my half of lease, but now I'm freaking out because one of my friends started reading the reviews. I'm slightly worried that I may have messed up by signing and I was wondering if anyone has lived there/is currently living there. I wanted another opinion on the place and hopefully it would prevent me from spiraling lol. If anyone can help that would be great, thanks!

Bachelor's degree in 2 and 1/2 years
I will be majoring in computer engineering, if I take 16 credits in my fall semester, then if I start taking 20 credits every semester and 12 credits in summer. I can complete a bachelors degree in (16+20+12)+(20+20+12)+20 in 2 years 4 months. It will save me money for housing and all other expenses. For a total of four years, it will save me around $50k, I will get a full-time job in 2024( January) and then I can pay my debts.  After working for 1.5 to 2 years, I can do my master's if I want. Can anyone please let me know how many credits I can take maximum? Please comment on your opinion or other alternate options. Thank you.

Edit:- How this will work? BS in 3 years 

(15+18+12),(18+20),(18+20). I can do an internship in my sophomore year and then I can find a full-time job after 3 years, in June (2024). 

Thanks for sharing your opinions and suggestions, I understood how hard it will be, but I am working 112 hours/ week now. So it won't be affecting me. I am not interested in games or movies or any other stuff. I like putting myself into uncomfortable things.

How attainable is it to get into the Business School?
Hi! Im a senior in high school who got into Madison as business. Its my top choice but not being directly admitted and not seeing many other people get business is stressing me out. For people that have gone through the process, is it worth it to go to Madison as business with the hope of transferring in (like is that part doable??) since im seeing mixed reviews on the website and from people.

Question about Sticky Housing Situation
Throwaway account so my friends don't find this, but I'm kind of in a difficult situation for housing next year. I have a lease for 2021-2022 with some friends I made this year, but right now I'm realizing that I just don't have much in common and like them that much, and the place I have leased is on the cheaper end, but I want something more higher end. 

Luckily, I'm able to get out of it because we are now adding another person, but they can take my spot, I talked and they're ok with this. I don't really have time to look for a place and then cancel my lease, I'm busy with school, so I was wondering if I should cancel the lease I currently have, and hope that I find a place between now and when school resumes. Obviously, this is kind of risky, because I could end up with nowhere to live in the worst case, and everything full now, but hopefully someone needs an additional person or something like and it works out for me?

How is the curve in CS639?
I‚Äôve been attending the lectures and I get 5/5 on almost all of the projects but I got destroyed on the midterm with like a 71% which brought my grade down to like 80%. I‚Äôm worried if I do equally bad on the final that I won‚Äôt pass. What has the curve been like in past semesters? I know the professor mentioned there will be one on piazza.

I calculated a very rough estimate for the OOS/international acceptance rate
Disclaimer: This is an extremely rough estimate with data provided by the university, I simplified the numbers to make the calculations easier. I‚Äôll elaborate even further in the future. 

The university received aprox. 53k applications in the 2020-2021 cycle, of which we can assume half received an acceptance letter. Wisconsin‚Äôs acceptance rate has sat at around half for the past decade, and it‚Äôs reasonable to assume it dropped this year. Even still we have no way of knowing how much, so I‚Äôll work under the assumption half of all applicants received acceptance letters. 

This means aprox. 26,500 were accepted into the school. Out of these, Wisconsin residents make up 50% of enrolled students. For the sake of simplicity, we‚Äôll assume that the yield rate is 100% and that the resident/non-resident makeup isn‚Äôt altered. This means 13,250 Wisconsin residents were granted admission. 

According to the university, they accept 2/3s of all Wisconsin applicants, meaning they rejected aprox. 4412 people. Combined UW-Madison received aprox. 17,662 in-state applications. 

In-state applicants made up aprox. 33.32% of all applications (aprox. 53k). For the sake of simplicity I‚Äôll take the number as simply 1/3rd. The other 66% were OOS/internationals. Despite being 1/3rd of the total applicant pool, Wisconsin residents make up 50% of the university. Meaning there are only 13,250 spaces left for the other 2/3rds. 66% of 53k equates to aprox. 35,298 applicants for aprox. 13,250 spaces/acceptances. 

This means only 37.53% of OOS/international applicants will receive an offer of admission. 

This percentage could be assumed to be lower for Minnesota residents and internationals.

Spanish 224 poetry and theater exam: HELP
I'm taking spanish 224 this semester, and our second exam is coming up next week. If anyone has taken it before, what did the exam cover? Do we have to remember what all of the poems we read were about, or was it more like we are given an excerpt and have to identify the figures of speech that are there? Any help would be really appreciated, we haven't really gotten any information about it

Dorms
while I'm exploring my housing options right now, id love some suggestions for dorms/learning communities.  

I'm a social guy and I love to meet new people but at the same time I want to prioritize my academics and while I don't mind having people over, I want some peace at night. I definitely want to live in one of the southeast dorms. I plan on majoring in biological sciences and I was wondering if anyone could tell me about Biohouse and if it's worth it.

 What are the benefits of joining a learning community? other communities I'm interested in are Chadbourne residential college and the international learning community. and lastly, if I prefer learning communities in the housing contract does that mean I get to live separately with the other learning community members?

I like to do work on a lot of GUI/frontend based programs and I was thinking this might help. Any thoughts?

Questions about housing
I‚Äôm an incoming freshman and deciding which dorms to pick. 

- Would it be better to pick a single or double dorm? ( the main concern with double dorms is what would happen if my roommate gets covid? how safe would that be for me)

- is it easy to make friends in a single room or is it preferred to stay in a double to socialize more?

-would I get my preferences easily?

-are the sizes of single rooms and double rooms the same even if it‚Äôs in the same dorm?

Thank you
--------------------------------------------------
Single vs Double
How much is the cost difference if I choose to live single in Dorms? I am interested in sellery. It is showing $11,800 for single and $11,300 for double. What's your opinion? Please comment.

Certificate Programs for English and Economics?
I am a potential freshman (I will very likely be committing in this week) at UW-Madison. I have been accepted for Computer Engineering. 

I was hoping to understand more about Certificate programs at UW-Madison. I understand that they are the equivalent of minors. Is this correct? I was also trying to find more on whether or not there are certificate programs for English or Economics, but they don't seem to be available. Why is this? What do I do if I want to study these alongside my major but also have it on paper that I studied them? 

Also, ignoring the fact that I may not have the time for it, would I be allowed to double major in Computer Engineering and English? 

Thanks in advance!

A very confused potentially prospective student...
Basically, I'm admitted to the College of L&S with plans to major in computer science. I am really interested in finance/business as well, and I am unable to find any clear information on if it's possible to pick up a major in finance while doing comp sci. I've read about the certificates, but I would prefer the actual major, and I would appreciate any help with finding out if this is possible!

Edit: I would also appreciate any info on how difficult it is to switch over to finance/business administration.

Freshman Dorms
Hello all, after weeks of going back and fourth between the U of Minnesota and UW Madison, I finally decided to be a badger. Now for the next step. Dorms!

I have done research but would like input from any and every student.

I would prefer to be in a dorm that would be considered to be more social, yet I still want to be able to get all of my academic work done when need be.

Campus Facilities Open During Summer?
So I am a Sophomore this year and with covid they obviously didn't have the shell or nat open last summer. Do they normally keep these facilities open during the summer?

B.S Geosciences/Geology
International prospective undergraduate student who‚Äôs interested in the following majors (title). If anyone takes this, could you tell me about it? Class size, professors, research, etc. 

I will also add that I currently take the IB and I can‚Äôt transfer my credits for this major, based on my IB credit courses. As in, I didn‚Äôt take physics or chemistry as an HL or SL subject during my DP years. Only in 9th and 10th grade. Will this affect my chances of admission?

Housing for Musicians
Background: I am a pretty avid pianist but not a music major and as such I do not have access to the school of music practice rooms. Does anyone know of housing where there either is a piano in a building or it would be possible for me to bring my upright piano from my parents house and play it without annoying people? I had a keyboard in my dorm freshman year but that really isn't the same so I am trying to avoid having to do that again.

Honors Algos (CS577)

Side question: If you took algos with dieter (honors or not), what was your experience with him? Good/Bad/Ehh?? (From what I've been able to gather, his class is hard but worth it)
--------------------------------------------------
Switching to a Business Major (Incoming Freshman)
I was just admitted to Madison and I'm starting to wonder whether I really want to follow through with my intended major.  How difficult is it for me to change my major, and how should I go about doing so (if I should in the first place)?

My intended major was neuroscience and I was admitted into L&S, but after more thought I think that a business-related major like Economics or Business Administration would be a better fit (for example).

Do I need to apply to the School of Business?  Can I not because I've already been admitted to L&S?  I'm feeling pretty lost right now...  I've also emailed UW, but I thought I'd reach out here to see if I can hear from someone with first-hand experience.

P.S. Before someone comments this, I did throw this in the megathread with no response beyond someone stating that they were in a similar situation currently.

What are the best "for fun" classes?

Like a lot of people, quarantine loneliness is hitting like a train and I‚Äôve really been missing meeting new people. I‚Äôm a 22m mechanical engineering major hoping to meet people outside of that circle. I would love to meet more people in the arts/humanities side of things.

A little bit about me: 
I‚Äôm fully vaccinated and very covid conscious.
My hobbies include knitting, painting, baking, and biking. I‚Äôm in charge of the student org ‚ÄúKnit for a Cause‚Äù!

Music options for an amateur saxophonist?
I‚Äôm currently a freshman (as in, going to be a sophomore next year) I just started learning saxophone last June, entirely self-taught, though I‚Äôm hoping to maybe start doing lessons this summer. I‚Äôd consider myself competent...but nothing spectacular.

I‚Äôm weighing my options in terms of actually doing some band things for credit. I‚Äôm aware there‚Äôs the regular audition-less ‚ÄúUniversity Band‚Äù course and the audition...-ful(?) Marching Band, which is fairly competitive in terms of actually getting in.

I‚Äôm assuming I‚Äôm probably not ready to get into Marching Band quite yet, but I‚Äôm not sure if anyone who‚Äôs in/been in Marching Band knows differently. Should I try out anyway just in case? Or is not even really worth my time? Is the University Band course actually helpful for building my skills to try Marching Band later down the line? If anyone has any advice or information to offer, that would be great.

Econ 102 Hold Question
I am enrolling today for classes and am planning on taking Econ 102, but it says that I have a hold preventing me from taking it. I checked my student center and I have no holds on record. I am currently in Econ 101, which I think might be the issue, but that would mean that I couldn't enroll in Econ 102 until after exams and might not get it. It is my only class showing that it has a hold. I have emailed multiple people with no response yet. Has anyone had something like this happen or know what to do in order to remove the hold?

So in this class we have to do an project on nonprofits where we research them and also we need three interviews from people who work there. Problem is, I've reached out the organization, and even people personally and I have not heard one peep. It's due on the 29th and I'm getting stressed out because eveything else on this project is going well but I can't seem to get an interview with anyone because the organization doesn't seem to be active at all.

Taking a D or a UD and trying again
Hello, i‚Äôm a SoHe major, and I‚Äôm doing fine this semester... except for this one class. For SoHe we need a stats course and the one I‚Äôm in is just killing me, can‚Äôt comprehend the topics and I‚Äôm on pace for a D in the class. If this happens should I accept the D or take a UD and try again? Are there any easy stats requirements for SoHe majors? 

If I accept the D I most likely won‚Äôt be on probation as I expect to receive a few As/ABs.

Does it mean like the classroom gonna be literally outside of campus somewhere?

As a Finance Major, How Important Is Accounting 211 and 301
I‚Äôm a Finance major but I‚Äôm required to take these classes. I was thinking about picking the easy route and just taking these classes at a different school like Whitewater so I have an easier time. 

But, I don‚Äôt wanna cop out and get the easy A if the skills in these classes will be useful in future finance classes and in the finance job market. 

So, would it be worth it to take the easy A and fulfill the requirement but probably not retain the skills, or should I take it at Madison because the concepts taught will benefit me as a finance major?

Chad Res college selection? Incoming freshman
Hey, I want to live in Chadbourne.

The housing form forces you to pick at least 2 learning communities and then to prioritize learning communities. I only want Chad -or- a non-learning community regular dorm. 

Advice? Do I pick something like the business direct admit community for my 2nd choice even though I‚Äôm not business in order to force Chad or nothing?

How often to people not get Chad if its their first choice? I dont want to kill my chances at other dorms bc I prioritized learning communities and the chances for getting Chad are low.

(I know Bradley is like a ‚Äúlakeshore Chad‚Äù but I don‚Äôt want Lakeshore, I want SE more downtown life).

This seems more complicated than it should?!? I‚Äôm OOS and know no one at UW! Thanks!

Grading Question
I‚Äôm an alumni, life sciences and law. My daughter is in the business school. It seems like the curves for her exams are crazy, and it‚Äôs not just business school, seems true for other majors as well. When a majority of the students are getting less than 60% on an exam, then I think there‚Äôs one of two issues going on: either the classes aren‚Äôt being taught in a way that students are getting the information or the testing isn‚Äôt accurately assessing the information that‚Äôs been taught. I‚Äôm not a prof, but I‚Äôve been a TA, I‚Äôd think 70-80% would be questions on the specific information taught and the remaining 20-30% would be your extrapolation/deeper understanding questions that would adequately reward students with higher comprehension. Am I crazy? If all the questions are extrapolation type then how do you know students have mastered basics? Thoughts?
--------------------------------------------------
Why (I believe) Math 222 grading this semester is flawed.
TLDR: Grades are far from representing your class performance and knowledge due to a variety of factors mostly caused by the online format. 

&#x200B;

I'm a current student in Math 222 this semester, and to be frank, this class has been far from ideal this semester. A lot of these issues stem from the online format. While I'm aware that being online isn't their fault, I think that some things should/shouldn't be in place to make this class run smoothly and fairly, even online. 

&#x200B;

To begin, my biggest gripe with this class is how random things seem when grading. Basically how are exams work is that we take it on webassign and then upload our work after. The webassign portion is only 15% of our grade while the written is a whopping 60% of our grade. However, when it comes to the written portion, only a random 2 or 3 or so of the 5 or 6 questions are actually graded. I think that this is a problem because with a bit of bad luck on which problems are selected, you can end up getting a much lower score on the test overall than you would get if the tests were graded normally (full test graded, partial credit awarded, as in an in-person class). For example, on our last test, I figured out 4/6 questions but couldn't get the last 2. That would normally equate to about a 67%. However, 2 of the 3 questions chosen to be graded just happened to be the two that I couldn't get, bringing me down closer to a 30-40% overall. Not only this, but there are many different TA's and they all grade differently, with many that will give you a 0/10 on a problem for making one or few mistakes (has happened to me more than once). On top of that, there's also the increased potential of people cheating, thus skewing the average and messing with the curve (I know this isn't their fault, but it's still something to consider). All three of these factors, in my opinion, make for your grade being kind of far off from how well you know the class material and your overall performance. 

&#x200B;

Thanks for taking the time for reading this and sorry if I missed anything or seem a bit ignorant. I'm only a freshman and haven't actually taken an in-person class here. I'm only writing this to blow of steam from our last exam. Please don't be toxic; this is just how I feel. I hope other math classes in the future are different/will work out better for me.

Mental Health Resources at UW
Hi Fellow Badgers! For a class project, my partners and I created [this website](https://mindovermatterhealth.weebly.com/mental-health-resources.html) with a list of all the mental health resources we could find for UW students! All are low or no cost and are available either in person or virtually. We've also created a [special group for Freshmen & Transfer students](https://mindovermatterhealth.weebly.com/freshmen-connect.html) that meets 1x/week over Zoom to talk about stressors and try to problem solve! We're also hoping to help students build a friendly community, since we know it's tough to be new on campus even without the pandemic. Our next meeting is **tomorrow (Tuesday, 4/20) from 5-6 pm central**! We have another session **this Friday (4/23) from 3-4pm centra**l. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out!

EDIT: here is the [Zoom link](https://uwmadison.zoom.us/j/92411941783?pwd=VURDTzYwWW5BOWJhWk1vSUovUFIxZz09) for Tuesday 4/20! I will update again with Friday‚Äôs link closer to the date. Thank you for all your interest.

GEN BUS 306 Summer
Is there any chance that they might open up more classes for 306 over the summer? 1 class with only 50 slots seems like far too little for a class that serves as a prerequisite for many students.

Financial Aid Appeal Question
So I appealed my Financial Aid Offer about a week ago. I recently got an e-mail with the subject "Professional Judgment Changed". I checked my portal and my EFC was adjusted. Nothing else changed. Does it mean my appeal to get more aid was unsuccessful? They do mention that it does take a couple of weeks, however, in my e-mail to the office I mentioned that the offer I get determines whether I'll go, and so I would need a decision before May 1st. I also called them and they said I should include tax documents to speed up the process a bit. Does anyone have any experience?

Accessing the nick rec facility
So I‚Äôm currently enrolled at uw or I suppose will be soon. I‚Äôve never been to a gym but want to take advantage of this opportunity and maybe ‚Äúget in better shape‚Äù 

What do they need to let you in 
, currently? I know the green pass won‚Äôt be required starting may 10. I already have a Wisc card due to being at several programs, taking classes through HS years. 

Do they swipe your card, look at it? 

Any details would be helpful! Thanks!

Classload Advice
Sorry if these kinds of posts are annoying but I'm completely in the dark here. I was wondering how this classload looks... I wasn't able to meet w my advisor in time for enrollment and I did this entire year online from home.

ACCT 100 (3cr)
MHR 300 (3cr)
OTM 300 (3cr)
MUSIC 103 (3cr)
PHILOS 241 (4cr)

Also is 15 minutes between courses enough to get around? I'm hesitant to enroll in courses with only a 15 min gap in between but I might not have a choice.

Any insight/tips/advice on these courses would be greatly appreciated!

Mikhail Ivanov for Math/CS 475?
To anyone currently in 475 with Ivanov (NOT HANLONG FANG), what are your opinions on him as a professor?

I know that he is relatively new. How do you think he is doing so far with his teaching? Is there anything that bothers you or is unfair?

Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------
Russian Classes
For anyone who has taken Slavic 101 or any of the additional classes in the language beyond that, how have you liked the classes? Are they difficult, is the workload tough? I know that MadGrades has the GPA as relatively high. I‚Äôd love to hear some feedback.

How do I enroll in the 3 credit option??
I am looking to enroll in econ 102 which is listed as a 3-4 credit class.  When I try to enroll it requires me to choose a section, but all that are listed are the discussion sections, meaning it would be 4 credits. How do I enroll in just the  3 credit lecture, without the discussion section?  Thanks

Housing Only For The Fall Semester
Does anyone know of any places that do fall-only leases? I will graduate in December, so this would be a preferable option if it's possible for a studio or one bedroom apartment. I have heard that The Regent does some fall leases, but it applies only to some 2 bedroom apartments.

I realize there are probably not many, if any, options for this. I figured it would not hurt to ask. :)

Housing near campus (cost, pros/cons, etc.)
Hey folks!

I was recently admitted to a Master's program at UW-Madison and I am excited! But as much as I am excited, I am also somewhat worried because of all uncertainty in housing and whatnot. My studies will be with the Economics department if that information helps any bit.

* Are there any apartment rent websites you use in Madison?
* If you rent apartments nearby, are there any concerns? Say, the neighborhood is too loud sometimes during the night, or the safety level, etc. (I checked the safety score and Madison looks good in general, just wanna make sure).
* What is the usual price range of rent per month?
* Is there any supermarket in the neighborhood that you guys prefer more than others? Walmart, Target, etc.
* This is probably a weird question but considering that I have always been in small cities/towns, I gotta ask - how is the parking? Is it as bad as they say?

Thank you for any of your answers and again, I am very excited to join UW-Madison!

Clashing classes (CS 400 & MHR 305)
Hi, I‚Äôm a Sophomore this Fall, majoring in CS & taking a certificate in entrepreneurship.

The section I wanted to enroll into for CS 400 (Gary Dahl, with no waitlist capacity) is full, and my enrollment starts the day after tomorrow.

The only other section with Dahl clashes with my MHR 305 class, which I also need for my certificate.

1. Should I email Professor Dahl about this? (I‚Äôm not super sure how this would work, since the waitlist capacity is 0...)

2. Should I just not take MHR 305 to make way for CS 400, and find some other class that works with my schedule?

Any info helps, thank you so much for your time! :)

EDIT: my enrollment date is 4/21 & late in the evening, but I can enroll into MHR 305 on 10 am 5/1

Class Enrollment Clusterfuck
Soooooo I'm kind of at a loss as to what to do for my classes (again). I transferred here last semester and got royally screwed over with classes (they didn't save ANY seats for transfer students) so I delayed some of them. 

I thought as a rising junior I'd have no issues getting them this semester. I was wrong! I can't get into SHIT and I still don't enroll until tomorrow at 3:30pm, which is after most other rising juniors. I'm not sure what to do. The physics section I was approved for (I had to get an exception since the transfer math credit isn't the exact same algebra class even though I took Math 211 too) is "Closed" but somehow still has 14 seats left? 

I'm scrambling to make this work. Seriously: what am I supposed to do?

A question on AP and IB Credits
Hei everyone. I was part of the IB Diploma Program and am now admitted to UW-Madison. My question was: If I get credits for a course, that basically means I can skip that course in college, right?

Also, Can I get credits for the same content from both my IB marks and my AP marks? What if they are geared towards different classes? (like one towards a General Elective class and the other a major-specific class)?

INTREGR / EPD 397 workload
How much work should I expect from the summer section of EPD 397 (I'm in the section that you take with an internship). I am debating whether or not to take another class this summer in addition to 397, but am a bit worried that doing so might be too much since I'll be working full time as well. 

How many hours a week did you have to spend on the class? How difficult were the assignments? Do you think it is doable to take 397, an additional summer class, and to work full time?

Thank you!

CS 577 summer course hours per week
Hi, I am a rising sophomore (currently a freshman) and I am planning on taking CS 577 with Jiazhen Zhou. I am also going to be working for 40 hours per week over the summer, so I am wondering if the course will be too large of a load. Would the course load be around 10 hours per week or more? I don't know because it's a summer course. I have all the pre-requisites, and I have done some algorithm stuff before, but I haven't done any proof-based algorithm analysis and this shit looks hard even though this course is called 'Introduction to Algorithms'. My motivation for doing it is to offload hard classes for myself during the summer so I can have more flexibility with electives during the coming semesters.

Retailing and Consumer Behavior Courses
Hi! I am currently (a rising sophomore) looking between the majors of actuarial science, retail and consumer science, and communications. I am curious right now as to what **course(s)** would give me a **good feel for the retailing and consumer science major.**

Right now I am hoping to enroll in [CNSR¬†SCI¬†257](https://guide.wisc.edu/search/?P=CNSR%20SCI%20257) - Introduction to Retail to get a feel for the major and see if I'd be interested in it. I am not optimistic though that this class will still have seats for people who have not declared the major by the time it opens up. Just wondering if anyone in the major has any other recommendations for classes (or even resources) that would give me a better idea about the feel of the major. 

Thank you so much for reading!

Online classes as an accommodation?

Taking a summer pre-req, but can‚Äôt enroll for fall class
I‚Äôm taking Psych 210 this summer and want to enroll in Psych 225 for the fall, however Psych 210 is a pre-req for Psych 225, so Course Search & Enroll is not allowing me to enroll in it.

CS 577 Accelerated Honors With Dieter
I know Dieter's version of the class is the hardest but I was wondering how the accelerated honors program would be since Marc's section is completely filled up and I don't want to take it with Bach. I've heard Dieter is a tough grader but his section is also the one which learns the most, and is really helpful for fundamentals. Does anyone have any experience with this? How's the workload compared to the usual 577? Can I still do my usual 15 credits?

UW-Madison or uVA for Engineering / Computer Science?
I have been accepted to both colleges for Computer Engineering, and am having a hard time picking one (my gut feeling is also fluctuating). I understand that responses here might be biased, and have thus posted this on r/UWMadison and r/UVA. 

For more context on my major, although I've been accepted for Comp Engineering, I'm debating between Mechanical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science. I would like to pick a college that is good for all three majors. (Yes, I understand that I don't have a lot of clarity.)

Both colleges have similar rankings overall, but UW-Madison is slightly better for my majors in particular. However, I've been told not to give these rankings too much importance. Should I? And how can I better understand the two schools' Engineering / CS departments? (I've looked up clubs, classes, but this is all very one-dimensional on websites.)

Some factors that I would like to consider are how much time and how many opportunities I will have to learn outside of the classroom (clubs, research opportunities, internships), and, secondarily, the quality of the English program, since I'm sure I want to minor in English. Also, I've heard that UW-Madison is a party school, and I know that isn't really my thing, so I want to know if that will negatively impact my life at UW-M or my resume when I'm applying for a job. Another thing I've read is that UVA, being closer to NYC/Boston etc, provides better job/internship opportunities. To what extent is this true? 

Since I am from a warm country, I've been told to consider the weather, where UVA would win. However, I have family in Chicago, and for this, UW-Madison should be favoured. While these are important factors for my parents, they aren't for me. Should they be? 

Can you please shed light on all the factors I've listed above? I'd like information on them. I also want to know how important these factors are. If there are other points you think I could consider, could you please tell me? 

I'm sorry about how long this is, but thank you so much in advance! If any of you can text me privately, that would be great!

Citation for being at picnic point
Hello, so quick story, this all happened today. I was having a tough day and decided to walk to picnic point at around 11 pm ish and do some meditation. When I got off the bus I saw a sign that said ‚Äúno alcohol, no fire, sunset to sunrise‚Äù or something along those lines. 

Now fast forward. I finished meditating and all of a sudden two UWPD cars are on the trail and one of them comes out to ask for my id and get a bunch of information. 

Long story short he asks if I‚Äôve ever received a warning of any kind to which I said no. He then says he has no choice but to give me a 260 dollar citation. 

I can‚Äôt pay that... I have a court date but I‚Äôm not sure what to do in the slightest any help is appreciated:)

Which certificate is more beneficial for an econ major, math or cs?
If I were to do the cs certificate btw, I would only go up to calc 1 math-wise.

Edit: If I do the math certificate I would take CS 220 and CS 320 but just those programming classes.

Also, which certificate would help with getting a job the most, I plan on doing some type of analyst job or software developer job (took cs 200 and liked it). Maybe in the future I would also like to shift to data science, AI/machine learning, or software engineering.

I got into L&S as an international transfer, but am worried about my dip in grades.
I got into L&S as an international transfer, and my first and second second semester grades were basically all As or higher, which is what I submitted. But I'm scared my grades will drop a little in my 3rd semester because of terrible internet issues, and that I may end up with a few B's. But luckily enough I'd have completed my 4th sem before attending UW Madison, and 4th sem seems to be going a lot better because I have fixed my internet issues and can attend classes now. I am very afraid that my admission might be revoked. I have strong extra-curriculars, ongoing research projects and good community involvement. Is this likely, and should I be worried? What can I do to avoid this happening?

I‚Äôm looking to find a research opportunity for the upcoming fall semester, but I‚Äôm not super sure when I should be sending out a ton of emails to professors to ask for these opportunities. 

Do I do it now? Midway through summer? Maybe at the end? I‚Äôm a freshman, so I‚Äôm not really sure if these opportunities also tend to get posted on the student jobs center at some point in the summer and if I should just wait for those postings. 

Any guidance is super appreciated! Thanks!

Is there a reason why Madison offers significantly fewer credits for science classes such as Bio and chem. MN offers 12 credits for chem - Madison offers 3. Madison gives you a zoology credit for Bio whereas MN gives you a biology credit. Is there any way to get around this?
--------------------------------------------------
Where to find roommates for grad school?
I‚Äôve seen the new Madison student housing group before, but it seems to mostly be rent listings, and less a place to find people to live with. Any ideas?

Math 340 Profs
Does anyone know about Dohyun Kwon? I couldn't find him on ratemyprofessors and there is no instructor listed for the other two sections of 340 so I am debating between getting him or risking getting Maxim

Math 421 summer
Is anyone taking this class in the summer and want someone to study with? Message me.
--------------------------------------------------
CS 240, CS 354, CS 400
So I was supposed to take CS 400 over the summer but it is all full where I wanna take it. Taking all 3 in one semester is my only option. I have 2 more classes with these but those are super easy and won‚Äôt take any of my time. Is this a bad decision?

Freshman housing application
It forces me to pick 2 learning communities to apply for and makes me answer short essay questions in a pdf document. If I don't want to join any LC can I just leave the application pdf blank?
--------------------------------------------------
The sheelin apartments
Does anyone have experience with these apartments on w mifflin? Didn‚Äôt find much from a search. They seem to be reasonably priced for size and location. Is this area of mifflin loud enough that it‚Äôd disrupt the apartment unit itself?

Thanks for any help!
--------------------------------------------------
Social Orgs
I'm gonna be a sophomore living off campus next semester and I have no friends thus far into my freshman year. I'm nervous about making friends and was wondering if anyone had any club recommendations for making friends. I'm not religious btw and so the christian groups aren't really for me. I'm just looking for low time-commitment and fun clubs to meet/make friends, if y'all know any :)
--------------------------------------------------
Course Search and Enroll Issues
Is anyone else having issues with the Course Search and Enroll app on myUW? I can't save a schedule or enroll in a class. It just keeps saying "Checking Eligibility" on each class.

UPDATE: It's just been fixed

Sophmore coming onto campus next sem, housing?
I'm a freshman right now, currently in Asia. I took all online courses this year. I know I am definitely coming to Madison next semester, but I am not sure about housing. 

I haven't received any emails about applying for dorms. I would prefer to live in an apartment with other students, but I don't know how to apply/find those either. Any help?
--------------------------------------------------
Dorms closed to freshmen
I read that Davis and merit are closed to freshmen but while filling the housing contract, it gives me the option to choose either of them. Are they still closed to freshmen or has it changed
--------------------------------------------------
Is Environment Studies 205 an easy A?
Does anyone take environment studies 205 before? Is it a easy bio course? I looked at madgrades and see it has A up to 90%, does it mean that it is easy? Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------
cs 400 cs 354 cs 240 esl 118 and another less stressful ge courses
Would that be a good idea for fall semester. Any suggestions or your experience in learning those courses (especially for these three cs courses)I am not confident about this plan, will it be very stressed out? 

Also for this summer I want to take cs 252 of Eric Hoffman. How much time have you assigned to this course every day when you take the course? 

&#x200B;

Thank you so much!
--------------------------------------------------
ECE 252 and CS 300 for summer term
Hi, I am taking cs 200 this semester and it is good. I am wondering would it be a good idea to take cs 300 and cs252 in summer. They are in the period of 6.21- 8.15 and 6.14-8.8. I do not have any other cs experience besides cs 200. I wonder would it be very stressful to take those two courses. Would summer courses be shorten Ôºü I found the period is much shorter than a normal fall or spring semester. Thank you so much!
--------------------------------------------------
Econ 321
Is the Econ 321 Summer Course difficult, and does anyone have any tips about the course!
--------------------------------------------------
Any Banner/FastTrack Students do a fifth year?
I was wondering if any banner or fasttrack students did a fifth year and how you supported yourself financially? Did you find any scholarships geared towards students facing financial hardship? Any info would be much appreciated.
--------------------------------------------------
Can‚Äôt decide between profs for ECE 252
Has anyone taken the class with either James Skrentny or Karu Sankaralingam give me an opinion on who I should choose between? I couldn‚Äôt find anything on ratemyprofessor and would appreciate any help!
--------------------------------------------------
Econ 400 vs 410
Does anyone have any advice on either of these two classes? I‚Äôm double majoring in Econ and Finance and I can take either 400 or 410 but I don‚Äôt know which one to choose since they are very similar. Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------
Most random/interesting class you've taken
I'm going to be a senior and I don't need many more credits for my major, just 29 total to graduate. Looking for some random classes to fill my schedule that aren't too difficult but are interesting/unique topics. I was going to try Intro to Landscape Architecture but it doesn't fit with my schedule. Or feel free to just recommend the best class you've taken.
--------------------------------------------------
Conflicted on future path
I was accepted to Madison a few months ago into CALS. I want to pursue a some sort of business or economics degree, so I was wondering if I should apply for the first choice consideration request to get into the School of Business or wait until SOAR and change into Letters and Science, and then take a pre-business path.

I read online that one of the Letters and Science ‚Äúpaths‚Äù includes economics, but I‚Äôm not sure what to choose. Any help is much appreciated!
--------------------------------------------------
CS 537 (OS) + CS 571 (Building UI)?
Just wondering if taking the two together would be a bad idea. I know 537 has a really high workload, and I've heard that CS 571 has a pretty high workload too.

Anyone taking 571 this semester? What are your thoughts about the course structure/workload?
--------------------------------------------------
UW Madison Honors Program
I recently got accepted into the College of Letters and Sciences and saw an email mentioning the application to an Honors program. I plan on majoring in computer science and more specifically in the machine learning/artificial intelligence area, and was wondering whether an Honors program would be worth applying for a CS student, because I know the Honors program tends to lean more towards the liberal arts side.
--------------------------------------------------
Pros and Cons?
Prospective UWisc Student from Bay Area, california. What do you guys like/dislike about the city (esp if you come from california also)? Also, how is the public transportation and the housing around there? I've read lots of mixed things so I'm a little overwhelmed right now. I got in for pre bussiness/ sociology.

Question is the same as what you see in title. Looking for a place to be able to get hot meals, lots of veggies, salads and meat.. not really looking for fried, carby stuff.

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------
Fall In Person Classes
Rising sophomore here. Sorry for the stupid question. The only schedule options i‚Äôve been able to get are ones with only 15-25 minutes in between classes. Some say ‚Äúin person at room ____‚Äù and some say ‚Äúroom pending‚Äù. I guess I‚Äôm nervous about in person classes. I don‚Äôt know where the ‚Äúroom pending‚Äù classes would even be. Is 15 minutes in between classes manageable??
--------------------------------------------------
Is this a doable schedule?
Is this a doable schedule as a sophomore who will major in CS but also takes a great interest in Econ (May consider double major)?

CS 400, CS 240, Econ 102, Econ301.

I've had no previous background in Econ before college. Only took Econ101 this semester, and found it quite interesing. Any other course recommendations for a potienial CS/Econ doule major? For CS I only had CS200, CS300, and CS252.

Should I do something if one of my professors has yet to put in a single grade into Canvas?
So I'm in a class and I have yet to receive a single grade on an assignment. I'm just really worried as there are literally only two weeks of classes left plus finals and I have no clue how I'm doing. For our first assignment our professor made comments on it but we still haven't even gotten a grade for that. Should I ask my professor about my grade or should I do something else? It's so frustrating when I have been doing my best to get my work in on time and trying to do my best quality work and my professor can't let us know how we have done on even our first assignment that was due in late February.
--------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm suppose to graduate in fall... but my last two requirements are full..
Chem 565 and Biochem 551 both have 1 section open, however they‚Äôre conflicting. These are my last requirements to graduate and I‚Äôm supposed to graduate this fall. Do I really need to stay an extra semester? (Im getting on the waitlist as soon as I can enroll)
--------------------------------------------------
CRB 670 / B M E 670: Biology of Heart Disease and Regeneration
Hi!
I just wanted to post and recommend taking CRB 670! It should be really interesting! It's about heart disease and regeneration - everything from basic anatomy to signaling pathways to models for regeneration. It only requires Bio 151 and  Biochem 501 as prereqs! It can also be taken if you are a graduate student. I believe the course is going to be held through WebEX. There will be 3 professors, each teaching on their areas or research and expertise. Enrollement may require instructor consent, but don't let that be a barrier. This class is definitely a unique opportunity, so I'd highly recommend! Currently, there are only 2 students enrolled, myself included. 18 spots left!
--------------------------------------------------
Do I wear a tassel for my minor??
I'm a first gen student and feel too dumb to ask anyone this irl. 

I'm graduating with a degree in English/Secondary Ed which means I wear a light blue tassel, but I'll also be earning a minor in French. Do I wear a second tassel (brown) to represent the minor, or only a tassel for my major? Would I look like a tool wearing two?
--------------------------------------------------
Upper-Level Writing Class for STEM Brains
I am registering for classes, and need an "upper-level, writing intensive" class for many medical school prerequisites. I am a biochemistry major who often struggles with the task of writing and English in general. Is there any fun class that might meet this requirement? It can be anything from plain English to GWS to theatre. I'm just trying to have some fun, as well as get a good grade. Open to anything!
--------------------------------------------------
CS 354 Profs
I‚Äôve been told to take the class with Debra Deppler since Michael Doescher has been not as great this semester due to other issues. If I take it with Deppler, the lectures interfere with another course I really want to take. So I am thinking of going either Doescher. Will this make or break my grade?
--------------------------------------------------
Harder course - PHILOS 211 or 241?
Debating whether to take ethics or logic in the fall. Going to go with whichever is easier to best balance with my other courses. Let me know if you have professor recommendations as well...thanks!
--------------------------------------------------
Language Requirements
Basically, I've taken French for 6 years (5th grade through 10th grade) and dropped it only because the school I went to in 11th grade had a 5 subject limit and I was a science student. French has always been my worst subject and I really do not want to take it again in college, so I was wondering if those 5 years could exempt me from the foreign language requirement. I know I technically only did 2 years of high school French, but it was pretty advanced considering it assumed everyone in my grade had at least 4 years of experience by ninth grade (it's required by our curriculum). Should I try talking to someone from UW about it, or would it be a lost cause lmao
--------------------------------------------------
2-Credit Natural Sciences Course Recommendations?

Journalism Major & Honors College
Hey! I'm thinking about committing to UW Madison soon, but I want to make sure I know what I'm signing up for. I'm planning to major in journalism ‚Äî what's the journalism major like here? Is it good? And what other journalistic opportunities are there on campus?

&#x200B;

I'm also wondering about the honors college. It seemed like admission to the l&s honors program admits you into its own major ‚Äî is this applicable to journalism as well? Or does it only apply to communications majors?

&#x200B;

Thanks for your help! :\~)
--------------------------------------------------
Enrollment Rant
Literally every single class I was planning on enrolling in is full except clap for credit. Love to see it. Graduating on time seems hopeless. I‚Äôm a Junior in good standing credit and GPA wise. Why am I getting screwed like this. 

Silly me thinking I could graduate on time with a CS degree without taking 18 credits every semester.

Looking for an interesting, flexible COMM‚ÄìB, humanities course this summer?
\[Posting from a "throwaway" account made for the purpose of promoting my course :D\]

Hi! This is the instructor for the Summer 2021 course **History 201:** ***Sex & Love in Asian Religions***.

While we're all super exhausted by online teaching, the format for my class is *flexible* and‚Äîdare I say‚Äîcould even verge on fun now and then.

Here's the general idea: We will collaboratively write, review, and edit a digital journal to showcase your research and thinking about histories of love, intimacy, power, and desire in Asia-originating religious traditions.

There is ***no expectation whatsoever*** that you come into the course with knowledge about Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and others. Along the way, we'll explore questions like:

* What did the Buddha say about homosexuality, and what is life like today for queer Buddhists?
* What do love letters teach us about religion and migration?
* Was there widespread gender and sexual pluralism in Asia prior to European colonialism?
* How are sex work and Islamic spirituality connected in urban mega-cities?

Consider signing up and getting your COMM‚ÄìB out of the way, or taking an extra History class this summer. I may not reply to DMs from this account, so locate my email in the [Course Enrollment app](https://enroll.wisc.edu/search?term=1216&subject=448) or the [History Dept. website](https://history.wisc.edu/courses/history-in-summer/)‚Äî***sign up, too!***‚Äîand let me know if you have any questions or want to check out the syllabus.

I look forward to learning with you this summer!

Signed,

A hardworking PhD student who ***LOVES teaching*** and is eager to get folks to take their very first course!

Math 475
CS/Math 475 has got to be the weirdest class I‚Äôve ever taken. We have a reading report (??) due and there‚Äôs no rubric, little information, only 3 examples. He just told us it should be 5 pages and in LaTeX and that‚Äôs it. We didn‚Äôt even have a due date until recently. There‚Äôs no tests and there was 9 homework‚Äôs that had nothing to do with the 3 hour lectures... i‚Äôm so confused

Double majoring
I got into Computer Engineering and now I want to double major in cs, how much it cost extra? And how it works? Please let me know. Thanks.

Chem 343 vs Chem 345 Difficulty
I'm in chem 343 with Bowman and am doing well in the class and I get the material. I'm worried for 345 next semester, especially since Bowman isn't teaching it. I really liked his teaching style and the fact that his practice exams are exactly like the real exams really helped me out. How much harder is 345 compared to 343?
--------------------------------------------------
Enrollment options
Thankfully, my freshman year, I‚Äôve had pretty easy enrollment that‚Äôs caused a few issues with gen eds, but other than that, has been smooth. It‚Äôs looking like that won‚Äôt be the case this next semester. We‚Äôre three days into enrollment, I‚Äôve still got another 6 to wait, and one of my classes, arguably the single most important to my major, just got taken up. First off, how? Who? And second off, what are the best options here? I could spend time hunting down an awful credit to replace the Comm B credit it looks like I might have to axe, but is there any better way to go about this? I heard sometimes slots open up as enrollment goes on, so I guess I have to check if that‚Äôs true.
--------------------------------------------------
What is the Workload like for Bradley's Roundtable Seminar?
I'm interested in living in Bradley Freshman year. My classes will likely be between 13-14 credits. I'm worried about how much additional work ILS 157: Bradley Roundtable Seminar will add to my pre-existing course load. What additional requirements are there for students in Bradley?
--------------------------------------------------
Question about Bradley Learning Community
I'm an incoming Freshman for 2021-22 and interested in majoring in International Studies. What is the community like for IS students at Bradley? I know Adams has the International Learning Community, but I prefer the format and dorms of Bradley. What is the ILS 157: Bradley Roundtable Seminar for IS students like? How much work is involved? My other classes will come to around 13-14 credits, so I'm worried how much additional strain that will put on my course load.

How to choose a later commencement ceremony?
Hi, just registered for next semester which will be my last, and trying to apply for graduation.  Do I just need to wait for May 2022 to be available for commencement, or can I not choose that?  I have May 2021 (weird) and December 2021 as options.

Need an easy biological science course
As title suggests.

Considering taking Environmental Studies 103 | Agroecology: An Introduction To The Ecology Of Food And Agriculture

--------------------------------------------------
CS/CE/DS Gals, is the program inclusive?
Hey! So I committed to Madison this morning, and I was wondering what you guys experience in your classes, are you respected? Or is there a bias? I'm only asking because in high school I was the only chick in my CS classes and a lot of sexual and uncomfortable comments were made to me.. and yeah just not a good experience in general lol. So are CS classes cool? I just wanna be treated like everyone else! (I hate being treated like some unicorn lmfao) Obviously CS/DS is going to be a meat fest, but as long as the classes are accepting I'll be fine, I just had such a bad experience in HS bc I'm blonde and small, so apparently this means I'm a direct target for weird sex jokes lol. Anyway let me know, just want to prepare myself!

**edit: 
also any cool women in tech/stem clubs i could join? i'd love to meet some of you!! hehe

Help choosing a professor for Chem 345
Enrollment szn is here! I am looking at enrolling in Chem 345 next fall and need help choosing a professor.

‚ÄúCoast to the finish line‚Äù Classes??
I‚Äôm graduating in the fall 2021 semester and I‚Äôve already enrolled in all the classes I need to graduate with my intended major/certificate, but I‚Äôm only at 10 credits and need one more class to get me over 12 so I count as a full-time student...

Anybody have any recommendations for a fun (or at least interesting) 2-3 credit class I can take? I‚Äôm open to taking just about anything and wanna expand my horizons a little bit, but I have no clue what I should be looking for and don‚Äôt really wanna go one-by-one through the catalog looking for options

Thanks y‚Äôall I appreciate all of you (unless Becky‚Äôs checking this sub... she can fuck right off)

Edit: You‚Äôre all godsends and I love you all

Asking professor for permission before enrollment time
A class that I want to take is already full, but I don't enroll until this Sunday. I know this professor usually allows a few people to enroll even after it's full. My question is should I wait until my enrollment date to ask or should I ask now? Basically, after the professor gives me permission to enroll, does that permission expire if I don't enroll after a certain amount of time? Can a professor give me permission to enroll before my enrollment time?

Choosing a Finance 300 Professor
I plan on taking Finance 300 in the Fall and my options are Bulent Parker and Mark Laplante. Can anyone give some insight into their classes/teaching methods?

I heard Prof Laplante is a hard, but good professor however his RateMyProfessor score is kinda low...

I haven‚Äôt heard anything about Prof Parker, but he does have a higher score.

So because of this I‚Äôm kinda torn. Can anyone provide any advice about which professor to choose??

Physics 202 with Yibin Pan: The worst run class I have ever taken
I'm not even mad it's just funny at this point. I understand that online classes are hard to teach but holy shit is this a disaster. The canvas page has no modules tab so to find resources you are constantly searching through files, pages, emails, announcements and none of it is centralized. Half the assignments have no due date and there are three assignments titled 'Formal Lab Report' that I still have no idea what they are as they have no information in the assignment, on the syllabus, anywhere. There are a lot more things but it all really came to a head and made me write this post on Monday when we had our third exam. The professor sent out 5 different emails about the exam instructions and two canvas announcements, all of which had some amount of conflicting information. He changed the format of the exam twice (?!) on the same day as the exam. I don't even know why I have to take this class but holy shit is it a mess.
--------------------------------------------------
Easy/interesting Neurobio electives?
Does anyone have some recommendations for easier neurobio electives? I‚Äôm going to be swamped in fall with other classes so I don‚Äôt want to take something that is going to add to my stress. I enroll later today and I wanted to take zoo 674 or psych 603 but they are now both closed.

Has anyone taken CS 639-Data Visualization with Yea-Seul Kim? If so how difficult was the class (I have only taken CS 320 but not CS 400 yet) and is there a syllabus for that class I could possibly get? I've seen mixed reviews about the professor so I would like to know how difficult the class is. 

Thank you!

How to know which dorm is the right for me?
I‚Äôm a freshman about to commit to UW-Madison. I tend to be extremely introverted and socially anxious. I‚Äôm legitimately terrified of having a roommate and the like, but oh well... At least I‚Äôd like some peace and quiet, and if possible avoiding the whole roommate situation altogether. I‚Äôve heard lakeshore is much better for this. I was also thinking about joining a learning community (preferably the one in Adams, since apparently they have singles there). Is that even viable? If anything else, which dorms tend to be the chillest and most silent?

CS classes already on the brink of having no seats
I am currently a Junior with an enrollment time of April 18. Was really stoked about taking CS 576 and CS 407. Well, 576 has only 21 seats left and 407 has only 53. 

My guess is that they all will be taken in 2 days. Well, this is a disaster.

Is anyone a landscape architecture major?
I‚Äôm currently a civil engineering major but I don‚Äôt think engineering is gonna work out for me and I was looking into the landscape architecture major. I wanted to hear about the major, preferably from upperclassman, and what their job prospects are after graduation. Landscape architecture sounds so interesting to me but I‚Äôm scared about the job market and how others perceive a land arc major. Will I have to go to grad school to get a good job or start my own firm? Is a double major in urban studies or environmental science doable?

Safer badgers storage space rant..
Just ranting - Safer badgers has literally destroyed my phone. I have 30 GB storage space and it takes up over 5 GB of that. If I call, they just say it's not supposed to look like that. But I went through the whole process to factory reset my phone to resolve this issue, unfortunately the safer badgers app deletes all your info so I had to re-sign up all over again (I forgot that would delete my photo  of the code..) and it's back to over 5 GB now with my phone no longer able to receive picture messages or function alot of the app image loading correctly anymore due to storage space.

I don't even have that many apps on my phone. And I never had any problem with my phone before safer badgers but it basically can't do basic functions now and there is almost nothing I can do about it. I think they give out loner phones but I live off campus, don't come very often and no car (only to test really...whole other issue) and I'm graduating very shortly so it isn't worth all the effort. I can't afford a new phone, so that is not an option, and this phone is only a year old. I am just so INSANELY tired of my phone not functioning correctly due to safer badgers, especially amid massive family health problems and not seeing them for basically 2 years. Apparently its too much to ask to be able to receive picture messages anymore.

Advice on neuro/psych double major
Hello! I‚Äôd like some advice on what to do going forward for my courses/majors. I originally was planning on double majoring in neuro and psych (I‚Äôm currently a freshman), and I mainly was doing that because I was confused about what exactly I wanted to do for a career. I just knew I was interested in the brain. But I now have a strong interest in pursuing forensic psychology, exit counseling, or I/O psychology. This has been brewing for a few years now, and this last year has just cemented my interest. 

I‚Äôm thinking I want to drop neuro now as a second major and just focus on psych. Some of the upper level classes for neuro have been taking all my attention and time away from what I‚Äôm actually passionate about, which is psychology. Can anyone let me know if graduate programs think double majoring looks better than having one major? Or do they not care one way or another? Let me know if anyone thinks this is a bad idea and believes that I should continue with neuro! 

If I do decide to take neuro off, I need a little advice on one thing. I‚Äôm currently taking bio 151, and I will finish soon with an AB or A. The next class for this is, obviously, bio 152. But this isn‚Äôt required for either a B.S or a B.A in psych, so I‚Äôm wondering if I should even take it? I know it has a mentored research component, but it has to be biological in nature, and the psych research labs I‚Äôm most interested in focus more on behavior and certain psychological disorders and group conflict, so I‚Äôm not too sure what I‚Äôd even do for that. On top of that, it‚Äôs 5 credits that I could be using towards more psych classes or classes that I‚Äôm interested in (like astronomy, for example). I guess I‚Äôm wondering if anyone would recommend I take this class because it‚Äôs important to have this bio background for MA or PhD programs for psych? Or is the class a waste of time for me if I do decide to take it?

How's the undergrad pure math program?
How are the research opportunities in pure math and the ability to take upper division/grad school level courses? Also, would it be suicide to try to double major with CS? I know at a lot of schools getting into a double major with CS is very difficult, so any advice in that regard would be appreciated!

When will I study my major?
Hi Badgers,
I have recently been admitted to UW and in the acceptance letter it‚Äôs mentioned that I have been accepted to the engineering college and the ChemE department. I heard that the first semesters I‚Äôll be taking prerequisite classes and I have to get a certain grade to actually get admitted to my preferred major.

Does that still hold true for my case? If there is a misunderstanding just correct me.

Anxiety about Fifth Year Loneliness
Hey guys,

 I'm a girl, currently a junior and switched my major in between this semester and last semester, so inevitably, I will need to do a fifth year, and I am terrified of the loneliness. I can say so many great things about Madison, but something that has plagued me (maybe due to the pandemic) was having an amazing freshman year to feeling very prone to loneliness as the years went by. Quite literally all of the close friends that I've met here are either graduating early or on time, and will likely be going out of the state. I love my group of friends and am sure we will continue contact after undergrad, but obviously as a college student I feel like I really would like some friends on campus.

I of course would jump at making any new friends, but I honestly feel like everyone by this time is already in their set social circle and isn't looking to expand it....I don't know. I'm starting a casual part-time job again, and I guess that's a great place to meet people, but I feel like that's not exactly the place where people look to hangout on weekends. I just feel very anxious about social interactions as years go by. Does anyone feel the same way or have any advice?

Don't Take CS 537!
Don't do it.  It is terrible.

The amount of work is incredible as is the difficulty of it.  I have taken all the usual cs classes up to algos along with 435, 559, 564.  Projects 3 and 4 in 537 were both more time consuming and difficult than the final B+ tree project in 564, which is known to be difficult.  There is 7 projects in this class!  Debugging these projects is nearly impossible, and usually figuring them out comes down to trying random things until it works.  You also need to sift through all the discussion videos put out by the TAs and hope that they haven't accidently steered you wrong.

To make matters worse, there's no break from projects to take exams.  The last 2 exams have both been less than a week before or after the incredibly hard projects were due.

And with all of this, lecture attendance is mandatory!  Doesn't count for much, but enough to make you feel you need to actually go.  Andrea seems like a nice lady and like she's trying her best, but she goes really fast in lecture and has sloppy handwriting.  The lectures help very little with the projects.

Find a different class for your software hardware requirement.

Deferred transfer for fall (instate student)
I just found out I was deferred for fall 2021. This completely shocked me. I'm a first generation student with a 3.9 college gpa, I am in multiple clubs within my school, I had 2 awesome letters of recommendation, and my essays were great. I had multiple tutors and writing specialists check over my essays and I included three interviews I conducted about UW grads in the major I was looking into. I am also a part of the guaranteed admission program. In addition, my high school grades were slightly above average. They said they wanted to look over my spring grades, but I don't understand how I didn't at least get a conditional acceptance. I am on track to get a 4.0 for the spring semester, so I should get in, but this really left a bad taste in my mouth. I applied to schools like Northwestern, Vanderbilt, Tulane, and Cornell. None of these schools made me jump through all the hoops UW Madison did. I am so above and beyond what the average transfer student is required to be. I honestly don't even know if I want to go here anymore. Sorry for my rant, but this just blows my mind.

Acceptance rate for OOS and international students?
Hey! I‚Äôve been trying to find the acceptance rates for these groups, and thus far no luck. The school‚Äôs general acceptance rate is 54%, and much higher for Wisconsin students at around 2/3rds. That being said it is also much more competitive for out of state applicants. I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone had the concise numbers. Thanks!

Computer Engineering
How much free time will I get? Is engineering hard? Last year total engineering students are 700 and L&S students are 3500, why there is so much difference? Is the engineering hall big? Will quantum computing professors present in the engineering hall? How can I reach out to professors for research? How typical an engineering schedule is?

Getting a D in math beyond calculus class
Does anyone know if getting a D in a math beyond calculus class meets the program requirements for Computer Sciences? I am graduating this year and have a job lined up and really don‚Äôt want to mess anything up. I am prepared to take a D and it earns me credit for the class, but wasn‚Äôt sure if it met the program‚Äôs requirements. If you‚Äôve had a similar experience or know about any information, please let me know! This is for stat324 btw!!!

University Dining Food Waste
I am a freshman this year and worked at one of the dining halls for the first semester. Every night I watched them throw away the hot food that was being sold at the convenience store, and I think I have heard from team members there that they also throw away the food at the end of the day in the dining hall too. 

Has there ever been any petition or push for extra food to be donated locally to members of the Madison community who don't have food security?

If I had to guess a reason they don't donate is that they are worried about being sued (or something), or maybe that they don't want people becoming "dependant" on the donations? -- Or am I unaware of some donating system that is already in place with the dining halls?

This has just been on my mind and I was wondering if there was anyone who might know anything about this topic on the subreddit. Thanks for reading.

Comp Sci 540?
Has anyone taken Comp Sci 540: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence?  I may take it as my machine learning elective for my Data Science degree.  Would you recommend the class?  Is the class taught in Java or Python? It looks like Liang is the professor.
