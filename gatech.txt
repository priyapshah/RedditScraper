Leaving stuff in apartment?
Anyone knowif you will be fined for leaving unwanted stuff in on campus apartments? I have a mini fridge but it would be annoying to store cuz I'm out of state and can't transport it either.

Transfer financial aid?
So I currently am comparing enrolling as a freshman vs going to CC and trying to transfer back in. My main concern is that I won’t get nearly as much financial aid when I try to transfer. For reference, I am an out-of-state student. Is it worth going to community college if a lack of financial aid might end up evening out with anything I saved from a free first 2 years? Does anyone know if this is how the financial aid works out?

iGniTe: worth it or not?
Hey, incoming freshman (CS) here.

I realized that I have nothing to do this summer, and they sent out this email about this program called iGniTe. Supposedly, it lets you get ahead on some courses and stuff, and they even let you do it from home, which sounds pretty nice.

If possible, I'd want to get ahead on some courses on the list of graduation reqs ([https://www.cc.gatech.edu/future/undergraduates/bscs/corereq](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/future/undergraduates/bscs/corereq)). For instance, I took both English Lit and Lang last year, and got fked by both of them (no credit), and I don't wanna have to take them during my actual time in college.

The website for iGniTe doesn't have a ton of info (the list of courses leads to a dead link lmao), can anyone give me some advice? Is it worth doing, and would it let me take some courses that I need to take at some point for graduation reqs?

Thanks.

Should I register for FASET orientation if I am still waiting on my waitlists and will definitely go if accepted to one (personal reasons)?
Hi everyone, I am really thankful that I was accepted into Gatech, and if it were to me, I would go without any doubt. However, I am an international student and my parents are paying for everything, so I really cannot be too rebellious. They treat Gatech as a trash school. I don't know why, but to them, just because Gatech is ranked low on the US News (bah, lower than the one my older sister got in which is Wake Forest University, and as they believe that she didn't work hard and got into a T30, I should have got into a T10 because I am "better" in most aspects related to studying). Another reason is that they have never heard of Gatech (they literally don't know about any schools in the US except HPYSM). Overall, the problem is that I am on the waitlist for 2 higher ranked schools, and if I get off, they definitely would force me to attend.  Even though it would be a pleasure for me to make them waste that 115 dollars, I just can't. Thus, should I register for FASET before hearing the waitlists?

Required to pass certain classes for CS major?
According to the course [catalog](https://catalog.gatech.edu/programs/#bachelorstext), CS majors are required to get a C or higher for a handful of classes. However, some other classes are not specified. Could I, for example, not pass combinatorics (MATH 3012) and intro physics (PHYS 2211) and still graduate successfully? Obviously not an ideal situation, but just wanted a clear answer since my graduation is approaching but my advisor wouldn’t answer my question

It's been saying that for hours and I'm panicking that I won't be able to enroll. Please help me out!!

Georgia Tech Housing Cancel Internship
How late is too late for me to cancel a semester of my housing application for next year? For context, there is one fall 2021 internship I really want to apply for (it's a long shot, so I don't expect to get it, and I plan on taking classes), but on the off chance I get it (and find out in the next month or two), is there a penalty for me to back out of on-campus housing/meal plan?

Question about graduation GPA
Does anyone know if there's a way to see the tentative GPA that I'll be graduating with before commencement? Also, if there's a chance that I graduate with honor after my grades are finalized for this semester, is there anything that I have to do on my end? Or is that entirely handled by the registrar? I don't want to have put all the effort in this semester only for it to not show up on my diploma haha

How “ahead” would iGniTe really put me?
It’s a day before the application is due, and I’m wondering to what extent does the program put me ahead. I’m not particularly interested in any of the available/ not full tracks to sign up for because none of them apply to my major (CS), but the prospect of being able to take higher level courses quicker is still appealing to me. How helpful would it actually be, and could I reasonably “catch up” if I were to opt out of it?

Is MATH 2550 important for future CS classes?
hey, sorry if this has been asked before/if these questions are frequent. I'm a CS major with threads in intelligence/media (possibly intelligence/devices if I decide to switch over). I'm planning on taking a few courses over the summer (CS 1332, CS 2340, and MATH 2550 -- about 8 hours total), and I was wondering if it'd be better taking MATH 2550 at another school, at tech, or just postpone it and take a course related to my minor (psych, which should be easy). I'm not sure if 2550 will be needed more in the future so, if it is, I can take it here. If anyone has any experience, please let me know-- any advice is appreciated!

[Question] What is the best way to test someone's ability to code??
Hi all,

What is the best way to assess someone's coding ability remotely? I want to build an app that assesses someone's coding abilities. In this case, does the test taker need to be in the app (the app watching the keystrokes) and coding in order to ensure he isn't googling the answer? If I allow the test taker to work offline, what is an appropriate amount of time to give someone to complete the task? Is it even advisable to do it offline?

It's been a while since I took tests but it seems to me that Google is the best crib sheet. Did I just date myself?

MSECE Decision letter Fall 2021 confusion
Hi,

So i just got off the phone asking the Office of Grad Admissions asking what exactly are the other documents that are needed after the Department of ECE sent their decision letter. Eventually the conversation evolved to if the decision letter given by the School of ECE is an offer of admission and the answer was no, and that I wont receive an actual decision until the end of May.

So I am pretty much completely confused. Does the decision letter given by the department hold any weight? Or was I incorrect in treating the decision letter as a letter of acceptance?
--------------------------------------------------
To those who didn’t do their CIOS...
Hope you get a 0 on all your finals.

“Fuel for Finals”
For the people upset about the event:

I was working at the registration desk, and I just wanted to put it out there that it was 100% dining’s fault. They told the food trucks the wrong amount of meals needed, we told dining to get 1000 meals and dining reported that we needed less than 200 for each truck. PLEASE don’t blame health initiatives for this, they have really good events and believe me- WE were pissed too. We didn’t know that they didn’t have enough food until the Good Azz Food truck said they were out of food- and even then they only gave out 92 meals. We tried really hard :(

Anything interesting grad students can do in the Summer?
Hi everyone,

So I've seen similar posts from undergrads but they didn't mention grad students, so I wanted to ask in a separate thread.

I'm a grad student. I have my research and teaching to do in the Summer, but I would love to do something interesting. I thought about taking some classes but there are hardly any classes available in any major that I'm remotely related to. Most classes are offered through the online campus which on-campus students can't enroll.

So I guess I'm asking senior grad students... Any ideas on what I could do? Classes that we can take? Anything else going on at Tech or in Atlanta in general?

I think GT should seriously consider allowing socialization without masks this Summer(explained inside)
This pandemic has been a brutal ride for most everyone involved- loss of income, loss of loved ones, loss of any sense of routine or normalcy. We've all been impacted in different ways, but I have yet to meet a person who has felt that their life has been improved over the past year. When students first came back to campus, Georgia Tech implemented a large number of restrictions and policies to help mitigate the spread of Covid, and I would say that GT handled this much better than any other college that I know of. We had a civic duty to protect not only our student body and faculty, but the surrounding Atlanta community- many of whom were much more at risk than our student body. With that being said, it has now been well over a year since this pandemic started, and I think that we should reconsider our stance as an institution for the Summer and coming Fall semester.

Here's why:

1. [Kemp opened up  vaccine availability to all adults(16+) on March 25th](https://www.ajc.com/politics/all-georgia-adults-will-be-eligible-for-coronavirus-vaccines-on-thursday/S2TLG4G3CBDNJBUPPRROV5ROSI/). Summer classes begin on May 17th, giving people almost 2 months to schedule a vaccine appointment. Not to mention, [one dose has been proven to be highly effective](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/02/22/pfizer-vaccine-highly-effective-after-just-one-dose-uk-early-data-suggest/?sh=152b387c2b04) which means that people STILL have the opportunity to sign up for vaccine slots within the coming weeks before Summer beings and be largely immune at the start of classes.  There are literally appointments through Stamps available for TOMORROW- even right now. 
2. Covid transmission has been shown to be significantly reduced in the [Summer months](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/covid19/files/weather_and_covid-19_preprint.pdf) and in [outdoor environments](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/945978/S0921_Factors_contributing_to_risk_of_SARS_18122020.pdf). These factors combined with the building immunity of our campus through vaccinations make it much safer now than in the past semesters to allow people to gather.
3. Our campus has been all but closed since last March, and students have been largely isolated and forced to partake in primarily online classes that are much more difficult to keep up with. This has resulted in a [mental health pandemic](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/) that very well might have worse implications for the wellbeing of students than the actual risk Covid poses to our age group.[College age students NEED to have social interaction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7292584/), and it is absolutely NOT selfish for students to want to seek out the company of others and have gatherings with their peers.
4. [Masks have serious adverse effects](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266691532030069X) on our ability to communicate which actually increases stress and can even impact our immune systems. [The CDC has even approved groups of vaccinated people to gather outdoors](https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/27/health/cdc-mask-guidance-fully-vaccinated-bn/index.html), and all Georgia Tech students have had the opportunity to get vaccinated with the slightest effort of signing up for a shot on the Stamps website.
5. [Georgia has relaxed Covid guidelines](https://www.11alive.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/most-covid-19-restrictions-in-georgia-to-be-lifted-thursday/85-ca06fcdd-9d49-4abd-b9e8-d2eb4d45658d) as of the beginning of April, meaning that the greater Atlanta area is largely back to normal. Being an incredibly low risk population that has all had the opportunity to get the shot, we should not be one of the only institutions in the state still adhering to these guidelines. The time to protect our community has passed, and, if the rest of the community is going back to normal, so should we. 

&#x200B;

At this point, with Summer transmission and outdoor gatherings already diminishing spread, and the ability for everyone at risk to be vaccinated as well as most of the general population, we must consider what the best course of action for our campus is. Georgia is open already, and we are one of the lowest risk populations possible in the entirety of the state. We cannot remain closed forever, and now is the time where I would argue that the benefits of reopening greatly outweigh the benefits of remaining closed. Georgia Tech has a duty to provide its student body with more than just recorded lectures and homework assignments. It is important for students to have an enriching experience that incorporates socialization and activities outside of just remote learning. Please do the right thing and consider the mental health and social development of your students. 

&#x200B;

Tl;dr Students have had the opportunity to get vaccinated, Benefits of reopening greatly outweigh risks, isolation/masks are bad for mental health, risk of catching Covid at an all time low, our entire state has already relaxed restrictions. Please reopen.

&#x200B;

Sincerely,

A concerned yellow jacket

What class should I take?: The Case for Russian
Every year I see the same posts: What is an interesting class to take? What is the easiest class to take?

Every year I make the same case: Russian. Let me tell you about Russian classes at Tech and why you should take it.

&#x200B;

# Smaller Classes

Russian Classes at Tech are on the small side, because readers are like yourself might be saying "why take Russian?". The smaller classroom gives more one on one interaction with the teacher. More popular languages have larger class rooms and though they still are smaller on average. This however does not compare to Russian. The teachers know you and care for you and this leads to my second case.

# Teachers

The Russian Faculty at Tech remind me a lot of faculty at a small time college. They are personal and caring. Most of the lower classes are lecturers so they do not get paid much (think about $50k compared to your major classes which average on >$100k). Quoting a former Russian teacher (Natasha Myshkin): " I do this for the students, the love of the language, and joy of teaching". They actively care about spreading that joy of learning about Russian and its culture which brings me to my next case

# Culture, Politics, and the Just Plain Interesting

Frankly, Russia is a meme. Russia is a country that is not distinctly European nor is it distinctly Asian. It is in its own category. It combines the best of both worlds. Russians have a distinct culture filled with superstitions, witty  humor, [great music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=989-7xsRLR4), and that revolves around hardship. Yet the most import is the aspect of comraderies. Once you befriend a Russian you have a friend for life. [Here is some extra interesting facts about Russian culture.](https://www.dookinternational.com/blog/20-interesting-facts-about-russian-culture/)

You might see in the news "Russia doing XYZ" or "[President Putin takes a dip in freezing lake in the middle of winter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnqxkTMehq4)" and it may confuse you, but you need to understand their mindset. Russian classes help with that. Learning a language gives you ability to understand a people and adapt a personality to that language. This brings me to the next case: Study Abroad.

# Study Abroad & Exchanges

The study abroad programs and exchanges offered by the Russian department are some of the most unique, interesting, and immersive. Russia requires a visa to visit. Believe it or not its difficult to get one. For Study Abroad: the TLDR is you live with a host family, explore nature, interact with native Russians, visit cool museums, and explore palaces of Tsar times. I will say you have a lot of lee way with these professors due to their personal relationship you will have with them. I was able to get my visa extended so I could take the Transsiberian to Vladivostok after my program. I ended up exploring all of Russia, visited Yekaterinburg in time to see 100 years anniversary of the Murder of the Tsarist family, and so much more. Being able to speak Russian with locals took me on many wacky local adventures that are once in a lifetime that had some [Bert Kriescher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paG1-lPtIXA) vibes.

Guess what - the exchange with St Petersburg Polytech is basically free. There are rumors spread around which span from "Russian government funding" to "anonymous donator" to "mutual agreement". Nonetheless what is important is a near 100% guaranteed full ride scholarship. What's the catch? Russian 1001 - 3002. You get to take classes in Russian and explore Russia more.

# Russian Club

The Russian Club is grassroot and not funded by SGA. It has more free reign than others ***\*wink wink\****. The friendships I have made in Russian Club are some of the strongest. I started in Russian 1001 with many of them, study abroad, and helped restart interest in it. Russia Club tries to bring the experiences we've had in Russia back to the States, partake in student outreach, mentoring, and events. Cooking class, camping, movie nights, weekly game nights only to name few offered.

# Easy A

Of course I have to bring up the grading. It is the easiest A you will make. [Bert Kriescher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paG1-lPtIXA) was right about Russian: its tough language. The teachers know that and they know how rigorous our classes are.

&#x200B;

# Lastly, thank you for coming to my TED talk

PSA: it’s ok if you have to retake a class.
It’s valid to feel bad about it. But it doesn’t make you any less of a good student, any less of a hard worker, or any less of someone who belongs here.

You can still get into grad school or med school or law school. You can still make a lot of money.

You’re in good company.

Anyone else not have an internship for the summer 😍😍
it feels really bad and i tried really hard and scrolling on linkedin rubs it in more also i’m a third year which makes everything worse!

--------------------------------------------------
I created a large student survey last summer (450 redditors participated) and am back with survey #2
If you check my post history you'll see that I circulated a student survey last summer across various college subreddits. About 450 students participated, and the survey data was written up in a [Medium Piece](https://medium.com/@liviamorris/i-feel-that-the-future-ive-been-working-towards-my-whole-life-is-gone-now-what-students-have-b33e5d09456b?source=friends_link&sk=ef9ef45585d8c9c8aff6eaa007cd09d3).

Now that we've been in the pandemic for over a year, I'd love to get your guys' feedback once again. The first survey was largely about the difficulties of adjusting to the pandemic, while this one is focused more on how the pandemic has impacted mental health and mentorship, as well as whether you feel that your campus is supportive of students who want to pursue independent projects (e.g. startups, creative endeavors, on-campus initiatives, etc.). All responses are anonymous (no personal info is collected) and you can opt whether to have your responses included in the write-up. 

If anyone has questions, please feel free to ask. And if anyone wants a copy of the raw data when it's ready, PM me and I'll add your name to the list. 

Thanks so much - and good luck with midterms/finals!

I got stranded at Buckhead last week 3 am by myself because our previous Lyft which my group of 4 waited 40 minutes for only wanted to take 3. I ended up waiting another 40 and still no  Lyft, not to mention my phone was at 10%. I found an Uber willing to go back but at 50 bucks, but that's just ridiculous from Buckhead to tech >:(

I got wayyyy too lucky and ran into a dude I backpacked with in Alaska two years ago who gave me a ride back.

Any who, I got an idea. so get a group of 4/5, pay me 80 flat for the night, and I'll drive your group anywhere. I can get to you within 5 - 10 minutes tops of wherever you are cuz imma just park in Buckhead and do some homework cuz I'm behind in quite a lot :(. If you wanna stop for food cuz let's face it you're probably starving when your plastered I'll take you. Wanna chill at a local diner I gotchu. Gotta yak? and I got trash bins, plastic bags, gatorades, pedialyte.

Hmu if this interests ya'll at all, good luck on finals :)

Spring 2022 Transfer Has a Waitlist?
I just had a question if the Spring Semester for 2022 had a waitlist as a Tranfer?

Suppose if there was a waitlist for the Spring Semester as a transfer, what would be the chances to get off the Waitlist for the Computational Media major?

GT Valorant Team/chat
Hey everyone! Is there a GC dedicated for people to play Valorant together? I’m not super great at Valorant just yet, so I don’t mean a super competitive one, but more of a chill one for people who are still kind of learning / playing for fun.

If you know of any clubs or GCs/discord’s that’s exist for this pls share!

Edit: I do actually want to try and get good, but in the meantime while I am not the best, I’m trying to find people to queue with*

Off campus Roommate search
Hi I’m an incoming graduate student doing my masters in civil engineering and I am trying to find a roommate to live cheaply <$900/month per person off campus. I looked in the mega thread but didn’t really see anything. I know there’s often Facebook groups for this kind of thing, if anybody has any tips of where to look (or is in the same boat) I would appreciate any insight.

Link to Vote for Vendors ??
The Tech Dining vendor consideration that happened today, it seems that the only way to vote was with the QR codes at the event, but it was so crowded and hectic I didn't scan any of the vendors and assumed there would be a link to vote afterwards, but can't seem to find it. Does anyone have any information ?? I would really like to vote lol

Multiple Service Issues Reported
Good Afternoon Georgia Tech Community:

The Office of Information Technology is investigating multiple service issues across the Institute. Services impacted include, but are not limited to, AMX Controllers, COE License Servers, EDM database, BuzzCard POS (Transact), and Pharos release stations. 

* The COE Licensing Server issue impacts access to programs such as matlab. 
* The Pharos issue impacts the release of print outs in the labs. To work-around this issue, please go to the Pharos release station in the Library and have a student worker release the print job to the printers there.
* The BuzzCard POS (Transact) issue is affecting external vendors (i.e., food trucks on campus) trying to process transactions using BuzzCard POS terminals.

We are working to resolve this issue as quickly as possible and will provide updates at [https://status.gatech.edu](https://status.gatech.edu/).

Thank you for your patience as we work to resolve this matter.

Does anyone have any tips for those of us that are just profoundly burnt out?
I've been feeling burnt out for weeks now, but right here at the very end it's gone from being "burnt out, but able to push through" to "burnt out and unable to do anything." I know what I need to get done, it's stuff that isn't even that stressful or hard, and I can think about exactly what I need to do to get it done, but I just can't do it. Not just schoolwork, pretty much everything in my life right now. Thinking about doing anything other than just sitting around doing mindless things seems impossible. It's like there's a mental block there or something. The idea of doing anything makes me want to puke. 


I dunno. I held up this whole semester okay but my assignments are starting to look late and sloppy and I still have stuff to do before the semester ends. I want to tell myself "just push through, you're almost there" but idk how much I have left in me anymore. Any advice?

* There \*may\* have been a third sushi place?

**Other**

* [General Mills](https://www.generalmills.com/en/Brands/Overview)
* [Kellogg's](https://www.generalmills.com/en/Brands/Overview)
* [US Foods](https://www.usfoods.com/)
* [Monster Energy Drinks](https://www.monsterenergy.com)

**Notes**

* Am I missing anyone? I'm pretty sure I got all of them.
* There was one place on the side with Caribou and US Foods that had a really long line. I believe the name was something like "Chuck and Moosi (??)"? They had a black and white stand and logo.  Can someone ID this place? I believe they were giving away food and not drinks.
* **Highland Bakery** is already on campus and **Dunkin** was in the old student center. IIRC, **General Mills** was/is the cereal in the dining halls and **Gyrochef**'s truck is frequently on campus. I imagine they all had to rebid or sign a new contract.
* There are several **coffee places** listed and the [Starbucks in Clough Commons closed recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/mj7xmg/rip_starbucks_clough_at_least_for_now/). Are we looking at the potential replacements? There are a few places on campus (Van Leer, CoC, MRDC) that used to have coffee stands that no longer do. I believe Blue Donkey's current location in Price Gilbert is temporary as well.
* **Kellogg's** and **General Mills** were on opposite sides of the yard lol. I doubt either of them knew the other was present. I find it noteworthy that [Post](https://www.postconsumerbrands.com/), the other big cereal brand, was not there.
* **US Foods** at first glance looks similar to Aramark and Sodexo, but after digging through their website, they appear to focus more on specialized catering and general "uplifting" of small restaurants. They also make their own food. I don't know if they would be running a restaurant here or doing behind the scenes stuff.
* I'm personally not a fan of **Monster Energy Drinks** and you can find them in any grocery store. What would they do at Tech? Have stuff in the dining halls?
* There weren't that many "mainstream" nationally known chains. This is good and bad. Good because I don't think anyone wants a McDonald's on campus (pls get Taco Bell though). Bad because "boutique" food places tend to be more expensive (See: Krog St. Market). **Jimmy John's**, **Caribou**, and **Dunkin** were present, but those three already have locations in Midtown. I'm fine with them but I prefer a chain like **Shake Shack.**
* There were two Mediterranean places and two (three?) sushi places. The survey listed several different "regions" for food. I'm surprised we didn't get a more diverse selection.
* A lot of the vendors do business at other colleges. I'm thinking Tech Dining researched offerings at other schools before reaching out to vendors. All in all, **I think they did good**.
* Dafuq is [this](https://imgur.com/wrgjeT3) supposed to be?

Thoughts?

MS GRA + on campus job?
Hello everyone,

I'm a prospective international MS student with GTAE. I've read older posts about living off of the GRA stipend and from my calculations, I would have just barely enough to live (with rent taking away the biggest chunk of the ~1900 stipend after taxes)

Are GRAs allowed to have an on campus job on top of their assistantship to help with living expenses? 

Thanks a lot!!

Don't forget! Leave a penny for Sideways!
Come by Harrison Square (on Cherry Street, where the Rosa Parks statue is located) today from 9am-5pm to grab a penny to place on Sideways' grave for good luck on finals! There is also free candy and stickers of Sideways for anyone who comes by.

Since 1947, Georgia Tech students have left pennies of the grave of Sideways the Dog for good luck during finals. Found abandoned outside the Varisty in 1945 by some Tech students, Sideways became a campus icon by attending classes, eating her meals at Brittain Dining Hall, and even leading the football team onto the field. She passed away in 1947 and was buried at the base of Tech Tower. To learn more, check out this link: [https://www.news.gatech.edu/features/dogs-not-dawgs](https://www.news.gatech.edu/features/dogs-not-dawgs)

If you are off campus but want to leave a penny for good luck, fill out this form and our members will leave a penny on your behalf!

Does going to lectures/club meetings that you aren't ready for helpful to you?
For example, let's say I am 3 weeks behind on a class, but I am trying to get my life together and shit, so I pull up. Do I learn the material by osmosis? I find that I don't understand anything, but sometimes, I'll have a flashback. Wanted to hear you alls personal experiences. 

&#x200B;

Another example - should I go to club meetings that I am behind on. For instance, a lot of the CS clubs like AI club or the cybersecurity club hold really awesome demos and lectures on different concepts, but I pull up and can't comprehend anything. Do I learn by osmosis?

No shirts in CRC?
I remembered when I first went to CRC, I was wearing my sports bra and leggings, and a very friendly CRC staff approached me saying you have to put your shirt on, and gave me a free shirt. 
I didn’t ask why, maybe conservatives (since it’s South) or for the reason of hygiene..? I have been wearing bra and shirt since then.
But today I noticed at least 3 girls were just bra+leggings...has the “shirt-on” thing gone... ? or just not implemented?
I do prefer wear less since it’s pretty warm in the gym. And we are wiping off equipment anyways.

How safe is walking around midtown at night?
I'm an incoming grad student and I'm looking to live in midtown. My parents are super worried about safety off campus especially since I'm a night owl and will also probably be walking back from campus at night. So honestly how safe or dangerous is walking around in midtown at night? 
--------------------------------------------------
[Housing][Grad] Off-campus housing for grad students?
I'm soon to be a graduate student and trying to figure out where to live and what the lease cycle is like - coming from Boston, the Sept. lease cycle is nuts here. Is there a similar spike in demand/price around August/September? And are there any hidden gems of areas/buildings that are a good value? Anything in particular to look out for or avoid? The most I've gotten is 'midtown is nice but expensive, home park is less expensive but less central' through looking on my own and any advice is much appreciated. Thank you in advance.

Happiness course (3 credit) offered in Fall '21 again: MWF two sections 11am and 3:30pm
I'm a Tech alum (MS HCI '00) and I'm doing a post doc here now. I'm teaching this course again in Fall 2020. If you're interested in practical ways to be more satisfied and happy or if you're interested in philosophy and the social sciences, I think you'll find this course interesting.

**Special Topics - Happiness**

(It may be listed as just Special Topics in some places)

BMED 2803

* Section A: MWF 11:00 (89445)
* Section B: MWF 3:30 (89476)

People on the **waitlist** usually get into the course.

Open to **all majors**.

You get **3 credits** towards general coursework.

Syllabus from an older semester here: [https://s3.amazonaws.com/chriscmartin.com/pdf/2019\_Fall\_Chris\_Martin\_BME2803\_syllabus.pdf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/chriscmartin.com/pdf/2019_Fall_Chris_Martin_BME2803_syllabus.pdf)

There's an older thread about this course here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/co595l/interested\_in\_a\_3credit\_course\_on\_happiness/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/co595l/interested_in_a_3credit_course_on_happiness/)

Some of the **practical** stuff in the course:

1. How to sustainably increase happiness
2. Cope with stress and disappointment
3. Make better predictions about future happiness
4. How people succeed or fail to find meaning in life
5. Work effectively with others
6. Appreciate cultural differences in the definition of a good life
7. Manage worry and self-deprecation

The more **theoretical** stuff in the course covers sociology, economics, and philosophy. It includes topics like the association between income and happiness, the impact of income inequality of Americans' happiness, changing definitions of happiness across history, and the difference between happiness and a good life.

Here are some **reviews** from previous students:

* "This was one of the most rewarding classes in terms of personal growth and understanding I have taken at my time at Georgia Tech...This course was a major factor in the growth this semester.”
* “Dr. Martin was one of the most knowledgeable and passionate professors I’ve had!”
* "Very useful - we learned about different theories and the history of happiness, but more importantly, I took away a lot of practical ways to improve my happiness."
* "I think I have done a better job of getting closer to the person I would like to be because I had the opportunity to look at myself introspectively."
* "I never knew how valuable it is to regularly talk about happiness and just keep it at the forefront of your mind."

Alumnus trying to access the salary survey - tableau login?
Hey yall,

Quick question - I'm trying to access the salary survey reports, and it looks like it's been moved over to tableau since the last time I looked at them, and it requires a login.

Best Laptops for ME student
Hi, I am an ME student with a minor in CS and I'm looking for a new laptop. My budget is around $1500, and I would love to hear some recommendations. Right now I'm debating between a Dell XPS and a Macbook. I like the Dell XPS because it runs windows and I've always had a windows PC. But I also like the Macbook since I currently use Apple's ecosystem with their iPhone, watch, and airpods. Please let me know what you guys have and any recommendations, thanks!

Anyone else feel kinda lonely
Hello! I'm a first-year that moved on campus this spring. The only friends I've made this semester are my roommates, but I'm not really close to them. I see other spring arrivals making tons of close friends and it makes me a bit sad since I try to hang out with acquaintances, but things always get pretty awkward. What are the chances of making more friends when classes are in full swing next year?

Health Insurance Plans: can all Grad. Research Assistants get the GRA Mandatory Student Plan?
I'm an incoming grad who will be receiving a GRA and I'm struggling to understand the Health Insurance Plans... It seems like there is the Undergraduate/Graduate (non GRA/GTA) Mandatory Student Plan ($919 for the Fall) and the GRA/GTA Mandatory Student Plan ($275). Do you guys know if I can deliberately choose between these 2 plans (even if I'm international)? Or is the cheapest plan only offered for some special students? 

I know that this question might seem obvious. However, I emailed the Stamps Health Services Insurance Coordinator and she said that the departments determine who'll get the  subsidized rate ($275). So, I emailed my department's academic assistant and she literally said that she has no idea who gets the subsidized rate. Moreover, my GRA letter says "The mandatory health insurance policy currently costs $919.36 for the fall term and \[...\]" So I'm extremely confused. Please help me guys.

(Intern/Job) - Looking for current GT Student interested in 3D modeling/rendering/game design/VR design/videography/photography - From 2014 IE Alumni
What's the good word Georgia Tech?! 

Hope everyone enjoyed the spring football game - anyone see the drone flying over the players?? I'm definitely excited to see that video!

My name is Joe Peluso and I'm starting a media/3D asset/aerial-inspection/future-tech catch all company. I graduated from GT in 2014 with an Industrial Engineering degree and after bouncing around a few related jobs I decided to start my own media company. It's been an interesting start so far considering the Covid timing but there's solid progress so far. I've primarily focused on photography/videography with/without the drone but I'm developing plans for large scale 3D models for Virtual Reality applications enabled through drone imagery, laser scanners, and regular photos.  

I have the technology (drone/camera/computer) and basic software (Reality Capture/Blender) plus a few potential industry partners but I want to expand the team and see if there are any current students that want to be involved in an upcoming project involving Georgia Tech. I'll pay what I can for your time and depending on your interest/level of involvement there would absolutely be long term partnership potential. 

Reach out to me at joseph.peluso.speaks@gmail.com or on Instagram @ [Joe.Peluso.Media](https://Joe.Peluso.Media)  


Thank you!

Cs ta interviews

Explore Living-Learning community. Is it worth it?
I was recently accepted into the explore learning community, I am currently contemplating whether to join or not. What's holding me back from joining is the requirement of living on campus. I will most likely live in my home for freshman year because my finances are quite tight and I believe I can save money by living at home. If I were to decide not to join the Explore LLC my freshman year, will I be missing out on a lot of pre-med opportunities? Will there be clinical shadowing/volunteering opportunities specific only for Explore students? Or are pre-med resources available to all Tech students?

Thank you

Is it impossible to transfer as an international undergraduate (US university) into Scheller?
I am an international student so I won't be getting any financial aid or loans for Georgia Tech. I was fortunate enough to receive a scholarship from ETSU which reduced my COA to $5,000 p.a. My parents told me they're willing to pay up to $25,000 per year, maybe a little bit more depending on the school. I plan on transferring from ETSU after my second year so I would've saved $40,000 or maybe more if I become the RA. I want to use this money saved to transfer into a good school for MIS (GTech, UArizona, UMN) so how easy or hard is it to get into Scheller and are there any scholarships for international transfer students? Thanks in advance for your help guys.

Can two people live in a single bedroom apartment near campus?
Hello everyone,

I'm moving to Atlanta as soon as the fall semester begin, perhaps just like you. Apartment searching has been really really stressful for me. I've reached out to potential roommates and landlord on FB, but I haven't been able to find an ideal place or a roommate that has around my target budget. As a poor student just trying to find a decent place near campus and scrape by, I was shocked by how many people I've met who are willing to pay $1250+ for a single room. If I want to live near campus, I'd really need a roommate willing to split the cost with me.

I'm wondering if it's common practice for apartment management to allow 2 people living in a 1B1B apartment, or 3 to 4 roommates sharing a 2B2B space. I know in California, at least where I am right now, it is legal and actually pretty common, especially in areas like UCLA/Westwood where housing cost is one of the nation's highest. Is it legal also in Atlanta? Or does the housing management explicitly prohibit 2 people from sharing a room that's marketed for 1 person? I've heard conflicting opinions from the people I've talked to, but I don't know who's right.

If you've lived in one of the apartments near campus, what's your situation like? Is what I've described allowed?

Thanks for your input.

georgia tech cheerleading
hi! i’m transferring to gatech in the spring 2022 semester hopefully and was wondering if it would be a pipe dream to try out for the cheerleading and/or spirit squad with no prior cheer or tumbling or stunting experience? i did gymnastics as a kid but not for a very long time and my skills are very limited, and was wondering if any past/current cheerleaders thought it would be possible if i worked really hard in the upcoming year and took adult tumbling classes? im really determined to try my best but i’m not sure how to start getting into stunting or if people would be welcome to a newcomer! but yeah i was just hoping for some honest opinions please or if i should focus my energy on a different sport

What are all those fees in the cost estimate?
I was wondering if someone could dm me a pic of their account summary that lists all the specifics like what fees there are and how much it actually costs for you to attend tech for a semester. I’m going to receive max aid and the COA is around 12k for me. that number includes miscellaneous stuff and living expenses. I come from a low income household and I’m going to be a freshman this year. Any advice or help is greatly appreciated

Does anybody know what the OOS georgia tech admit rate is and the admit rate for pathway offers?
Hi fellow yellow jackets! :)

So I live in cali and I have a family friend who's a junior working on apps right now and one of her dream schools is tech and she was wondering what the admit rates for the class of 2025 (this year) were! She's really stressed out because she's applying from out of state and for bio.

I was recently admitted so I would've told her but in all honesty, I have no clue. Everything I've searched up has different answers. Some sources are saying it's 30% while others are saying it's 11%. I was wondering if any of you guys have the correct data. Thanks! :)

A brief rant about professors and disability accommodations
Edit: To be clear, I am registered with ODS and have formal accommodations.

As many of you know, depression and anxiety can be extremely debilitating. Some of you may not know that you can actually receive [disability accommodations](https://disabilityservices.gatech.edu) for those (linked to ODS just in case anyone reads this and goes “really?! Maybe I should get registered!”).

To be clear, most of my professors have been understanding when something happens and I need to ask for extensions and whatnot. But there have been two or three now that have not. I feel like there’s a small handful of professors here that don’t recognize severe depression/anxiety/etc. as a disability, and as a result, they either:

a. Refuse to accommodate without a letter from the Dean of Students, or

b. Create an environment where you don’t feel comfortable asking for accommodations.

I just wish these professors would be more understanding. I don’t know if anyone else has had the same experience, but I needed to get it off my chest.

Graduation ticket questions.
Essentially, I have no immediate or close family. So am I still able to reserve a ticket for one or two people that I consider family that are not blood related?

I know we are given two but it's usually meant for someone's parents. These people I would like to gift the tickets to are not my parents (long story short, they aren't around). Is this a thing I'm capable of doing?

Thanks.

getting into georgia tech




I'm a sophomore in high school in SoCal and I want to go to Georgia tech for engineering (not exactly sure what kind just yet). I have a 4.0 gpa right now and I wired all my classes towards engineering for junior year (AP Physics, pre-calc, AP environmental science , principles of engineering , and a normal English class bc its required). For senior year I plan on taking calc BC, AP statistics, and some other STEM related classes but I was wondering what else I could do to help my chances of getting in. Unfortunately I live a bit far and I was also wondering if someone could tell me about the school life and surrounding area as I don’t know if I’d get to visit. I would love to go to a social school but I also don’t really want to go to a party school you know? Thank you!

Best way to distribute Commencement tickets to family?
With regards to the mobile tickets, does anyone have a good idea for how to distribute them around family so that everyone is set for Commencement? I haven't yet downloaded the tickets as from what I've heard Pass Sharing is disabled, so I wouldn't be able to transfer them to my family after doing so. Plus, the email with the tickets somewhat stresses not printing them, I'm wondering what my options are for this scenario.

Could I just take a screenshot of the tickets and send those to my family, or do I need to give them all the link and let them know explicitly what ticket is theirs? Not all my family members have a smart phone, so can one person just double-up on tickets to cover for both people?

Quick Q: Transfer Credit Evaluation - "Is this course required for admission?"
When applying to GeorgiaTech to be a Freshman, I reported having finished Chemistry, Physics 1, Calc 1,  2, 3, Differential Equations at my community college. All of these classes are in the system now but need to be evaluated. One question for evaluation is "Is this course required for admission?". I don't really understand what it is asking for. I assume not? I'm just very confused haha and I couldn't find anything about it on the website.

Thanks for the help/clarification!!

Ignite Summer Program, what is it exactly?
I've been recently admitted to the ignite summer program but still am not completely sure what it is. To my knowledge, Ignite is a head start to school for an incoming freshman but I have a couple of questions. 

1. Is it treated like a normal school term? with exams and assessments counted towards your GPA?
2. Do you have to pay the same tuition as you would for the fall and spring terms?
3. Would I be able to continue as a normal freshman through the fall and spring term?
4. Would I be able to do it through online classes completely?

What the heck, GT Dining??
Dining options are already limited as is (understandably) due to COVID and Student Center renovations, and they’ve now decided to close both of the dining options in the Dining Hub (Panda Express and Twisted Taco) from now until the end of the semester without telling anyone?

This seems like a dumb decision by GT Dining given how many people will still be on campus for finals.

Legitmately Curious
Not a rant, but how do yall do it? Based off a previous post here, the average GPA is quickly approaching to be over a 3.5 here. This is true even in the semesters of online learning. Do I just have a terrible work ethic, or is there some special secret sauce that Tech students ingest that enables them to succeed in school and try even when learning online/remote? To add, I would also like to note that most of the people I know in extracurriculars and socially are also similarly struggling and have no where close to the high averages typically mentioned. Maybe all of my friends and I are all just lazy, stupid, or some combination of the two.

Concerns regarding Biltmore Midtown
Hi! I’ve applied for an apartment at Biltmore Midtown(haven’t signed the lease yet) and I have a few questions for anyone living there currently! 

Are rats still a serious problem, as per the google reviews? I understand that the managements changing, but are they not doing anything about it? 

Also worried about the safety overall! I quite like the location, the price and the apartment unit itself. I can put up with most things, but I need to know what I’m getting myself into. 

Thank you in advance!

How long does a permit for a CS major take?
I've been waiting over a month now for a permit for psych 2015 and I didn't expect it to take so long esp given that I'm graduating in fall and I need it to graduate. Been talking to my advisor who basically says every week to wait another week.

Is this normal? I dont know whether to talk to someone else about this or just keep waiting. Are there any other cs majors that have been able to get in to that specific class this upcoming fall?

&#x200B;

tl;dr: I'm a cs major who has been waiting around a month for a permit for a psych class, has it taken this long for anyone else/has anyone been able to get in the class for next sem?

Update: followed the advice down below, got it resolved!

The Junior Design series of classes in CS is horribly designed [vent]
(Throwaway to avoid ruffling feathers)

**Background**: I will be graduating in a few weeks. I was a co-op student and  did all my rotations (and more). I have worked in group projects before and have put up with typical Tech stuff before, been put through the ringer, etc. But I took junior design my last two semesters and it was probably my least favorite experience with a class at Tech. I think the whole CS 2340 through Project Implementation series of classes really need to be re-thought by whoever sets the course objectives.

I'm sure some people enjoy the classes - I think it really depends on who teaches it and who your client is. But my issue with it is that Tech does absolutely nothing to prepare students for Junior Design which either makes the project really hard for some team members to contribute well, or means that older students have to pull more weight because the younger ones don't have as much experience (my experience). Now, I am more than happy to teach people how to do certain things, and I really am not a fan of shitting on team members for not knowing things. Everyone has to start somewhere and that is what college is for- older students taught me a lot when I was an underclassman. But because the class is so fast-paced and comes with so much busy work, it just feels like it's asking for a stupid amount of work from students with absolutely no explanation or support from instructors. Whenever people in my class have voiced concerns, it feels like the instructors basically just say "that's life, pull yourself up by your bootstraps". No problem, client issue, etc is a good enough reason to actually get some advice or support. The feedback they've given my team in particular doesn't even feel like they know what our project is or have been reading what we turn in. Sometimes we've even asked for feedback or clarification on assignment details and just been ghosted by the professors.

2340 is supposed to teach students the basics of object oriented projects, but the project and programming it uses are something different every semester. People can go into junior design knowing only Java and be expected to contribute meaningfully to a full JavaScript project within weeks. It just seems like its not really designed to teach students anything but to tread water, manage crises, and hope for the best. We already know how to do that - we're tech students. It's like it's marketed as a challenge for students to "learn" something about industry, but it kind of just feels like we've been set up to fail. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to learn from that besides that Tech hates my guts.

In the real world, if it's a choice between doing good work or completing a lot of features badly, most people choose to lessen the scope of the project and hire more engineers if they need more labor. I have done lots of "real world" work and have never been asked to jump into a critical project without at least a little training, project documentation, or time to adjust to the work setting/meet with coworkers who know more about the technical background.

These classes also literally never touched on user-centered design or tech ethics (at least in my sections), and I feel like that is a huge oversight. How are you going to send engineers into the world with absolutely no concept of how to take an adequate amount of time to test designs, think about how the technology would impact a user base, or negotiate features the client thinks they want (but probably doesn't actually for usability reasons) with the client. Why does this series of classes champion "writing good code" more than "building good/usable/accessible technology"? A lot of the time our client had no idea what he wanted and expected us to tie together our current project with past junior design projects that had no documentation and were only half done. And we couldn't tell him "no that won't work" or "I don't think that design is very usable" because the instructors want us to do whatever the client says. It just seems like such a silly and outdated curriculum, and not at all how things worked in any of my industry jobs.

That's my rant.

TL;DR CS Junior Design classes are kind of worthless. If you can plan ahead and do the research option or any of the other options... do it

No water in Maulding
There wasn’t an announced water shut off. Anyone know when the water will be back or have more info on this?

Edit: since there’s also no water in zbar that puts (this is a big underestimate) about 800 residents without water, with no prior announcement or warning (at least 10% of the undergraduate population). A systemic failure of this magnitude should never happen at an institution like this, it’s disappointing and quite frankly embarrassing.

Edit 2: a maintenance worker came into our room to tell us there is debris in the pipes causing a blockage of pressure. I’d recommend y’all boil all your water (that is if you can get any) cause who knows what’s in the debris.

How would I go about seeing a psychologist at tech
Hey Guys,  
I'm a first sem grad student at tech, and I have the GT health insurance (if that matters).  
I would like to see a professional for what I suspect might be ADHD or might just be me not wanting to focus on work. Either way, getting a professional opinion would give me some peace of mind and some idea as to how I should approach my problems.  
If anyone knows how I could go about this or has experience with this, please do let me know.

TIA

Georgia Tech vs UT for EE
Hey all! I was admitted to both schools for an undergrad in electrical engineering but I'm not sure which school to attend. I'd be paying similar out-of-state tuition for both. Here's a breakdown of the details that I've got for both schools:

**Georgia Tech:**

* Stronger ECE program
* Larger coop program
* Possibly larger study abroad program?
* More flexible in terms of switching majors
* Better reputation for tech and engineering
* Education is argued to be tougher or more rigorous
* Located in Atlanta which has many opportunities but fewer tech ones than Austin
   * Slightly more dangerous than Austin
   * Hot sometimes
* Less social due to its focus on engineering
* \~75% job placement rate for EE
* \~300 student orgs

**UT Austin:**

* Stronger school spirit/pride
* Notable engineering program but perhaps not as strong as GT
* A more rounded university (strong outside of engineering too)
* Large internship/coop program
* Large study abroad program
* Located in Austin, a booming tech hub
   * Better alumni connections within the city
   * Very hot sometimes
* Stronger school sports
* \~99% job placement rate for EE
* Difficult at times to register for some courses (not sure about GT)
* \~1100 student orgs

**For me, it really boils down to the fact that GT offers a more rigorous education while UT offers a better location (professionally and socially). What do you all think?**

**TLDR: Should I attend GT or UT for my undergrad in EE and why?**
--------------------------------------------------
UGA or GT for bio/bio sciences (NOT PRE-MED)
Im a senior in high school that got into UGA and its honors program as well as Georgia Tech. Currently I'd be entering either school as a Biology major, though I may switch to something a bit more focused like Biochem or Cellular Biology (or maybe Neuroscience if I were to go to tech). 

I do not plan on going to med school and instead plan on going to grad school and working towards a PhD so I cant do research in the field I'm interested in. Already emailed a professional in the field and they said a lot of majors would work but anything that focuses in cellular/microbiology, genetics, or neuroscience would be best.

Anyways I'm really torn between UGA and Tech. Both has similar bio programs but Tech has a better reputation in general and holds a bit more clout. Uga on the other hand seems to have a better social scene and would probably be easier to keep my GPA up at as I've heard GT can be a pain in the ass when it comes to keeping your GPA up. I'm also very interested in studying abroad if that makes a difference. I'm still fairly torn between the 2 (leaning towards uga) and will probably be committing within the next few days. Any help would be great, thanks.

tl;dr Not sure whether uga or ga tech is better for a bio science based grad->phd route

I also posted this same question in r/UGA but felt it would be best to ask both just in case the opinions tend to be significantly biased in one way or another.

Rooms in Culc closing at 11
So a few nights ago I was studying in one of the rooms in the culc and the cleaning staff came in at 11 and said the room was closed until 7 am the following day which really screwed me up because I was working on an assignment due before midnight which I missed by a minute because I had to pack up and move. Why do rooms close in the culc, literally other schools have all rooms open at any given time, and highkey we pay for building maintenance so why don’t we have access to rooms around the clock? Specially around finals time???

Georgia Tech Premed Experience?
Hi! I got the transfer pathway for arts and sciences (as a bio major) and even after hearing about how hard it is, I’m still really considering the opportunity because it’s actually my cheapest option compared to other schools (I’m an NJ resident but I do qualify for instate Georgia because I have a home in Atlanta and my dad is a Georgia resident, I also can save extra since I can just commute). I’m going to another NJ state school (The College of New Jersey) for the first year so I’ll have time to decide whether I’ll stay there or not. Price wise, TCNJ is 36k/year while GT is most likely gonna be 25k/year.

I want to know what the overall experience is, specifically from Premed students currently enrolled there. From academic rigor, to opportunities for ECs like internships and shadowing a doctor, to campus and social life, everything. Is it really that hard to get good grades? Did you wish you went somewhere else? Is it worth going to Tech for premed to save an extra 10k/year? Please share your experiences and tell me your pros and cons, Try not to sugar coat it but also please do not put Tech down, I really got a good feel when I went to visit and do want to go there but I just want a better input from premed students already enrolled there to see if it’s worth attending. Thanks!

The seating at the library is VERY uncomfortable.
Hello,

I've beeen to the library a few times now, and whether it is Culc, Price Gilbert or Crosland tower, I always find that the seating there is very uncomfortable to study. Every table is much too low relative to the chair/armchair. It's impossible to sit upright in your chair and not destroy your lower back.

&#x200B;

Do you guys know of places in the library where we can seat comfortably? What I mean is being able to pull your chair under the table, so that you can seat upright in it, and having a table high enough so that you don't have to look down on your computer.

A more positive post
So I have seen a lot of rants and vents around here lately (in their own right) and I wanted to provide my experience to you all.

I'm one of the few weirdos that actually enjoys online school. There are just so many advantages to it that it always baffles me how people say they are not learning. Maybe I have just gotten lucky these past two semesters with my professors, I definitely have had some amazing ones, but the main thing that I really like is the recorded lectures. One professor in particular did this thing where he broke down his lectures into 5-10 minute videos and put them into units. For some odd reason, I can't sit through a 75 minute lecture but I can watch his little videos for upwards of 4 hours and I feel relatively normal. It's not content I particularly enjoy either and don't get me wrong, his class is definitely stressful, but I feel like it would be 10x worse if it was in person. Additionally, as someone that has a lot of trouble listening, the subtitles in the pre recorded lectures (even though they tend to suck) make it so that I only have to guess 20% of what the professors say rather than 50%. Not to mention, I can always rewind and rewatch as many times as I need to for my ears to pick up that one word that makes the entire sentence logical. 

Another huge advantage is examination. I definitely feel much much much much much much more calm taking an exam in my room than in a classroom, and my grades reflect that. Not to mention, professors are more slack about making them open notes which is always nice (although rarely useful). Yes, honorlock sucks, lockdown browser sucks, I also don't want my data all over the place, but honestly it's really not that bad. My data is already all over the place anyways due to social media and the occasional GT leak. Quite frankly, most of the people I have met that complain about honorlock due it with the ulterior motive of wanting to cheat. That is a very limited sample of people and I like to think most GT students stick to the honor code, but I definitely don't think my human rights have been attacked by these apps. I personally prefer online examination infinitely over in person examination. 

Lastly, and probably more of a niche advantage: I don't have to drive to campus. I live about 30 mins away and I am more than happy I don't have to sit through that drive every day. I do have one in person class (that I actually like) and drive there twice a week (and a couple more times for extracurriculars) but at least when I do drive to campus it's for something I enjoy, so I'm not associating that commute with things that annoy me. Not to mention, my attendance has 100% improved since (a) I can wake up 5 minutes before my online classes and mostly pay attention and (b) even if I miss the class, there is usually a recording somewhere or pdf of the notes I can reference when I'm feeling up to it. 

I'd like to end this post acknowledging that my experience seems to be very different from those of others on this sub, and maybe I'm just very lucky, but I was hoping to give you guys a different perspective. I hope GT allows professors to continue the hybrid format next semester if they want to and doesn't force them to have in person classes. I think there are definitely benefits in autonomous learning for some classes and they should stay that way, and I also think there are benefits to in person classes (especially lab classes) and I can't wait for those to come back. I really hope GT learns from this semester and manages to include the systems that have been developed in future semesters. Thank you for reading if you made it this far.

Tldr; I enjoy online school and I hope GT sticks to a hybrid format and doesn't force professors to do all in person in future semesters.
--------------------------------------------------
Psychological abuse
Maybe I'm just too innately stupid to be a student here but I feel like my professors are willfully and intentionally abusing me right now. 

I've gained 10 pounds these past two semesters. I have new sharp chest pain. My hair is falling out. My back always hurts from constantly sitting at this desk. I'm waking up in panic multiple times a week, yet have no one to turn to because everyone just works in their rooms.

And yet somehow I don't feel like I've learned anything.

I will never be the same again after this year. The way that this fucking school and these profs have conducted these past two semesters has completely changed my personality and harmed my health. I don't even recognize myself anymore when I look in the mirror.

A post of encouragement
I figured I’d take a minute and post some encouragement for the many people who are inevitably having a tough time right now. I wanted to start by saying that it’s okay to feel like this school is stomping you down and you’re definitely not alone but at the end of the day that we are all in this together and there are very few people that you couldn’t turn to if you’re in need of someone to talk to. I’m about to graduate (I have two classes left this summer) and I feel like I’m grasping at threads, but I’ve thought about how much this school has given to me and I’m so grateful. I have a job lined up to start in august, I’m about to have a degree to my name, and I’ve had so many opportunities that never would have been possible without Tech. So I just wanted to say good luck to everyone going into finals and keep your head high cause while for some of us this school feels like a constant struggle I can definitely say it’s been worth it at the end. Don’t hesitate to reach out to someone or even myself if you need to talk and Go Jackets!

B.S in Geology/Geosciences
International prospective undergraduate student who’s interested in the following majors (title). If anyone takes this, could you tell me about it? Class size, professors, research, etc. 

I will also add that I currently take the IB and I can’t transfer my credits for this major, based on my IB credit courses. As in, I didn’t take physics or chemistry as an HL or SL subject during my DP years. Only in 9th and 10th grade. Will this affect my chances of admission?

What do I do this summer?
I was really betting on getting an offer this summer for an internship, but alas my sweat and tears did not pay off. I would still like to earn some $$ and have a fulfilling summer. I don't want to go home, and I don't want to pay for a 6th semester of classes in a row. I'm trying to look at this with an optimistic perspective of 'now I have a summer to do something really cool', instead of looking at it like 'the summer where I failed to reach my goal'. 

What are some interesting ideas or things you have done in my situation?

(....on the other hand, if you're offering an AE internship pls let me know)

Physics Major Include Astrophysics?
When I look online at the physics major, it includes astrophysics in the heading but the actual degree itself doesn't seem to have any real specialization in it. Does anybody that study in the physics department know a bit more about how it works? Anything would be cool. Thanks

This semester has been an absolute drag. [Vent]
Sorry for venting. College so far has been the worst experience in my life. I have had no friends since July because I don't know anybody at Tech, and my high school friends are off at college elsewhere. Last semester was quite a challenge between school and mental health. I was studying for way too long each day and being depressed way too much each night, so I decreased my expected work for this semester.

Well, this semester was a different beast. My mind has been completely out of it since the beginning of March. Our supposed-to-be spring break was a period of the greatest mental difficulty I have ever experienced due to the combination of burnout, loneliness, and and wishing I were on a beach somewhere with friends. That week was easily the busiest of the entire semester, and I still haven't recovered.

No matter how hard I try to study, I still end up far below my desired grades. I am talking about studying all day for 5 days and still doing subpar on an exam. My grades are tanking as we head into finals. I was once on the border of reaching my goals, but it is now basically guaranteed that I finish at least one class with a grade below my goal.

I don't see how this semester is fair. They can't just give everyone A's, but I wish the professors would help out a little so that I don't have to split my time between studying and attempting to fix emotions.

Tech was once a place that I looked up to. Heck, it was something I dreamed of since 5th grade. It is slowly becoming something I dread each day. I went from having GT flags and football posters around my room to taking that all down and having blank walls because I don't really care anymore. I feel like there is no help or care for the students, and my experience has really tainted my view of the school.

 / / / / / / / / / / / / /

*TL:DR-*
Tech has been far below what I expected it to be throughout high school, and my mental health is as big of a challenge as my classes.

*Note to current high school seniors*: Don't take my perspective as what you should expect. You will have a different (and more positive) experience, and I will be alongside you trying to redo my own freshman experience.

Georgia Tech Research Opportunities for Freshmen
I'm really sorry for making this post (I try to avoid these college decision posts), but at this point I'm desperate.

I'm trying to decide between UT Austin and Georgia Tech for aerospace engineering. Right now, I'm leaning towards GT due to smaller class sizes and a better aerospace program than UT. However, it just feels wrong for me to pass up the opportunity to attend college in Austin (a growing tech hub at the moment) and take advantage of in-state tuition.

**Question:** What sort of freshman research opportunity programs does Georgia Tech offer, especially for aerospace?

UT has programs such as FRI and ARL for incoming freshmen to do cutting-edge research with graduates or the Navy, but it doesn't seem like GT has anything similar? I searched up "undergraduate research opportunities" for GT and it seems like there are requirements you need to have before applying?

I'm sure there are research programs open to freshmen where you submit an application and if it gets accepted, you get to do research, but I haven't been able to find it.

Any help is appreciated! :)

Buzzcard access after graduation
I’d like to confirm this issue based on this post https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/8ef577/quick_question_regarding_library_access_for_alumni/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3

Similar situation, I’ll be graduated on May 7, but will stay near campus for about two months finding jobs during my OPT Grace Period. Besides using library like that post mentioned, I also would like to workout and swim at CRC again, since by the day I graduate I will have two weeks passed after my 2nd dose, so I’ll be fully vaccinated and safe enough for the gym.

For alumni, do we still have access to CRC as well as the library for other facilities? Also, are we eligible to refill and use dining dollars at the dining halls?

Westmar Lofts Experiences?
Hi. I'm looking into the lofts as this will be my first time renting and I have some questions to those who have lived in them?

• What was your experience living their? Fair price? Any extraneous costs besides rent?

• How did the roommate pairing process go? Did you select them or were you just randomly paired?

• Was rent automated or was it written via check? What was the application process like? Do they offer 10 month or just 12 month leases?

Also, side note, I am looking for roommates if anyone sees this post and is looking into Westmar Lofts too. 

Thank you!

Looking for a future career
Heyo. I'm a current first year biology major, and while I know I'd like to go into a biology-related field, I just can't seem to find a career that screams "PICK ME!!". I like birds (all animals, really), genetics, people (in a studying sense), microbiology, and immunology. I am NOT interested in a medical or teaching career at this time. I love niche careers that no one has heard of though! Any advice/ideas? Thanks!

Transferring from KSU as an Interactive Design major?
I’m currently a first year student at KSU, and while I haven’t developed a complete opinion on the school yet, I’m not sure if I’d want to stay here all four years either.

I was wondering if I were to transfer in the future, are there any majors at GT that are similar to KSU’s Interactive Design major? Here’s a short description of it: https://radow.kennesaw.edu/tcid/programs/bsid.php

Also, regardless of your major, if anyone has transferred here from KSU, I’d love to hear your experience and whether you think it was worth it. Thank you!

Political atmosphere?
I’m getting the vibes that some individuals on here are the “I’m not really into politics, it doesn’t matter” kind of privileged after reading some older threads which is unfortunate coming from an Atl native😭 How would y’all describe the overall political atmosphere at Tech? Does it lean more in one direction than the other? Please do not get angry or defensive i just am curious on how it is at Tech! Thx <3

Is it possible to get a GTA/GRA position as a new intake for the Masters in Industrial Design three year program?
I’m an international student, newly admitted into the 3 year MID program for this fall. I’m curious about alternate ways I could use to pay for tuition (apart from banking on my parents), if not for the first semester, at least for the second. 

I was wondering if it’s actually possible to get a GTA/GRA position in that first year and if so does anyone know anything about how to I could go about applying and getting a position?

Any tips or advise would greatly be appreciated.

I've never seen my group projects fall apart like this semester before
Techies are among the most responsible/ hardcore team players I've ever met, so it makes what's happening this semester the more jarring. In the same class, I had one person only writing exactly one paragraph out of a 15-page report despite me helping them (and by extension the group) getting a deadline extension from the professor (we ended up unable to complete the paper in time), and another person not showing up for any meetings for the final group project. In my VIP class, the entire team doesn't show up for a few weeks straight.

I want to attribute this to COVID burnout, but I just wish they let me and my other teammates know of their struggles beforehand so we can just figure out how to get the job done? Idk if this is just my poor luck or a widespread symptom of students being paralyzed by fear and anxiety

2 3-hour classes at Grand Challenges
So, in the invitation for grand challenges I read that it requires 2 3-hour classes to be taken over the year. Now, I'm fairly new to this system since I'm an international.

Would the 2 classes be like one each semester or 6 hours a week?

How can I help my friends who are feelin low during this time (and in general)?
A heavy question potentially, but I just got off the phone with someone who was feeling a LOT of pressure from this semester.  It was to the point where I was genuinely concerned for their safety and well-being, and I really did my very best to understand where they’re coming from.  However, as someone who’s just a student, I definitely cant call myself a therapist, and a part of me isn’t 100% sure if any reassuring I did actually made them feel better (or worse, if I made them feel worse than before they reached out to me)

I know a lot of this is subjective to the person, but can anyone recommend articles/thoughts/wisdom on how to react and help better in these situations? I wanna be there for my friends but I don’t wanna repeat something dry like “you got this” and leave them feeling like venting to me made things worse.

Thanks in advance!

UT Austin v.s. GA Tech for CS
Hello all,

I've been accepted to both UT Austin and Georgia Tech for CS, and, as the title would suggest, I'm having trouble deciding between the two.

Here's a bit of my info:

\- I live in Texas, so the 20k tuition difference is definitely something I'm taking into consideration. 

\- I haven't been offered any financial aid aside from loans due to a high expected family contribution, but my parents aren't very willing to help pay. 

\- I'm interested in cybersecurity, and I would like to pursue a more security-related path throughout college. 

Any advice? Statistics (average department starting salary, percentages of graduates with jobs, etc.) would be much appreciated!

Is there anything in the faculty code of conduct about following a third-party's ToS?
One of my TA's is blatantly violating a (rather large) third party's ToS for using their service. Obviously the third party would care if TA do this, but does Tech? Is there any part of the faculty code of conduct (or equivalent) that covers this?

EDIT: I should clarify that we are using this service for class, and that TA is in violation of ToS in relation to our class's use of that service.

First breakdown of the year
Yeah...I thought I was doing alright this semester, but I just broke down crying last night over the stress of everything happening this week. I know a lot of people have been feeling similarly for the whole semester, and I thought I could somehow keep myself above the negativity and just keep working and push through. But no. It caught up to me and looking at my schedule for this week and everything I have to get done is super overwhelming. I’ve broken everything down to the things I can fit into one day, and I just feel like I can’t finish everything that I’ve assigned myself for each day, but I know I have to or else I won’t get to everything I need to do. 

School just feels like I’m working towards a grade that I don’t even think is going to raise my GPA and I’m drowning in all the work that I’ve put off in lieu of being able to get other things done that were more important at the time. I’m not even procrastinating anymore, y’all. I’m just procrastinating some work so I can do other work that has a closer deadline. I haven’t been to an orgo lecture in ages because they’re just problem sessions anyway and I haven’t caught up on the material yet, and the exams this week, and I have 2 weeks worth of textbook reading, prelecture videos, and lecture videos to catch up on. 

And everything’s impacting my personal relationships. I get snappy at my roommates and boyfriend, and I don’t even want to be around people because they’ll distract me from my work. 

So yeah. Sorry for YET ANOTHER rant about how school is horrible and mental health is deteriorating on this sub. I just had to write some stuff down. I still love Tech, but damn y’all it’s hard.

Edit: thanks everyone for all the support! I tried to upvote everyone and reply to DMs. Obviously everyone at Tech is having a rough time, so I really appreciate y’all are trying to help.

2nd edit: I got 2 projects due Thursday pushed back to Monday and used a late pass to get an assignment pushed back. So kinda feeling the stress a bit less now, but I still have an exam and a final this week and a group report due. Also took some of yalls advice and watched a movie w my roommates and boyfriend tonight (white chicks 10/10).

Explain health insurance to an international moron
It must be on purpose that insurances have a ton of confusing terms like copay, coinsurance, deductible, in-network and all of that.

Now trying to explain to a 5-year old how the mandatory health insurance for international students work: let's say I need to take prescription meds on a daily basis. Do they charge me for going to the doctor (not ER)? What about the meds and refills?

&#x200B;

Edit: 

An example of how it worked when I was an exchange student at a CSU: they didn't charge me anything for appointments, but they did charge the meds. I had to pay over $700 for the meds for that semester and the insurance (Anthem Blue Cross) refunded me over $600 (my deductible was $100). I also payed for two vaccines, and they were refunded bc I had "spent" more than my deductible.

What exactly does the program focus on? How was your experience? How did it benefit you in your career/success? What are the classes like? etc.

Thank you sm!

How are capstone groups (MechE) formed, and how are projects chosen? Is there anything I can do to prepare myself in advance?
I’m taking it this summer, and after once again being screwed over by teammates recently, I’d do anything for a senior design group that’s not trash. I’m not sure if we choose our groups, but I don’t know anyone else taking it. 

Additionally, how are projects chosen? Also, how do people end up in interdisciplinary teams since we have to register it as an ME course?

What if the Tech Trolley were an actual streetcar instead of just a glorified bus?
What if it came at a high frequency so it was reliable transit infrastructure that could get people places on time and serve our campus population? What if it was electrified and connected to a wire system like a real streetcar? What if it had priority in traffic? Idk

No but fr I haven’t been on campus in a while. I feel like I remember reading about them retiring the trolleys? If so, what did they do with the route after they retired the tech trolleys? What’s coming next? I haven’t paid close enough attention.

Is GaTech worth it?
I have a tough decision to make regarding the college that I want to attend, and I would like to hear the opinion of those who are attending GaTech.

To give a general background of my financial situation, my family has saved up around 100k for me to use for any college expenses, which I am very grateful for. I have also received a few scholarships amounting to around 10k that I can also use for any college of my choosing

Now for the tough college decision part. I was recently admitted into Georgia Tech with only a grant of $4k per year. I was also admitted into my Flagship state school, University of Cincinnati, with essentially a full ride, and admitted into their honors program. Do you guys think it would be worth going almost 80k in debt at a Tier 1 school like GaTech or should I decide to attend UCinci where the CS program is not as good compared to GaTech,but has good extracurriculars and coop program, and I have a 100k to use for other things(maybe grad school). I am very split on the decision as I am like most of the college students on this subreddit that aspire to join big companies in the future, and want to make a decent living for myself. Thank you so much for your answers!

**TL;DR:** Georgia Tech and be 60 - 70k in debt or University of Cincinnati (with okay extracurriculars) and have 100k to use after college?

Internship or nah?
I have a dilemma. I can either take a full time internship in another state over the summer and extend my graduation, which is coming up in December, by another semester. Or, I can turn down the internship and graduate.

I don't have any other internships but I have been working in IT for a long time (I'm a non-traditional student, aka old).

I graduated a while ago so I am not sure, but aren't there some summer coding bootcamps around Atlanta that he can attend?  Thanks!

PSA: check your iron levels before finals
Be sure to get your irons levels checked before finals begin. If you've been feeling really tired/sluggish, can't focus, or feel like you can't remember anything, you may be low on iron.

So be sure to check your iron levels before finals start so you can be at your best!

Should I go to UGA or GSU to transfer to Tech?
Tech has been my dream school for as long as I can remember. My dad is a Tech alumni and therefore I have a legacy connection. This meant that when I was denied freshman admission to Tech I was offered the condition transfer option. Although I was hopeful to get in freshman year, I knew in the back of my mind when applying that I was most likely going to have to transfer in. 

Could anyone that transfered to tech on a transfer pathway after a year at another school, or any transfers at all, give me some insight as to where I should spend my freshman year. 

I could either attend UGA or GSU and I'm currently leaning more towards UGA. I'm favoring UGA currently because it is a better school than GSU and I think It might prepare me better for the rigor at GT. I plan on majoring in mechanical engineering. However, I'm not sure if I should just attend GSU and possibly earn a higher GPA because it's considered to be a easier school. Additionally, although my main focus at either school will be on my academics, I still want to enjoy my freshman year. Would UGA become a distraction to my goal of transferring to GT. Will I get too distracted compared to if I attended GSU? 

Everyone around me is suggesting that I should attend UGA because of the freshman experience. However, most of those people also jokingly suggest that once I'm at UGA I won't want to leave. This makes he hesitant to attend UGA because my goal ultimately is to transfer to GT. 

Any insight or advice would be great 🙏

How to stop comparing yourself to others
This is half rant, half asking for advice, so skip to the end if you want lol. 

I’m a first-year, and so I’m already feeling quite a bit of imposter syndrome and anxiety that I’ve never had to deal with at school before. It’s made worse by the fact that I can’t help but compare myself to my peers, especially when it comes to communication. I always feel like my writing isn’t sophisticated enough, or that I can’t express my thoughts well when talking.

Whenever I’m talking with a classmate or just hearing them speak in a presentation or something, I keep thinking about how well they can form sophisticated sentences off the cuff or confidently talk about a topic we just learned. It’s worse with writing. Since we have weekly discussion posts for one of my classes, every time I read through everyone’s responses I think about how they come off as much more intelligent than my answer, or use better vocabulary, etc.

Recently we had to do a peer review for a lab report, and I was assigned to read the report of a friend. I remember him mentioning that he half-assed it, so I was curious to read it. Lo and behold, it’s written incredibly, and it looks like it could be professionally published. In comparison, my paper looks like it was written by a middle schooler for other middle schoolers. I found myself basically taking notes on what he talked about and the terms he used for his paper to sound so well done. I feel really weird and guilty about this, hence why I’m coming here.

So TL;DR, how can I stop comparing myself (especially my speech and writing) to everyone else? And as a bonus, how do you improve your communication skills to actually sound like you know what you’re talking about?

CS UNDERGRAD TA PAY

What decision should I make for the summer?
Alright, so I applied to a bunch of internships, and most of them straight up rejected me or ghosted me for a long time. Fast forward to a month before, I somehow secured a GRA position from a popular professor that strictly starts in the summer semester. I honestly did not expect I will be able to secure an internship this summer.

Then, suddenly out of nowhere, some retail company decided to offer me a position for a cs summer internship last week. I told them I will tell them my decision sometime this week.

I previously had some internship experience, but all of them were out of the US. Honestly, I had no chance to think deeply about my plans because of pandemic stress. I am not even sure yet if I will be going directly applying to Ph.D. or will be working in the industry after my Masters. Being an international student, I pretty much have to get accepted to a Ph.D. program or secure a job, or I will be leaving the US.

Since I never did GRA before, it might be a good experience to work as one this summer to try out academic research. However, I feel that I will miss out on the conversion opportunity by not doing an internship. In addition, I am not sure if it is even ethically correct to tell the professor about the change in my summer plans and turn away the research offer.

I am sorry about venting out my frustrations here but this is putting an extra burden on me, and I feel like I am staring into a void. I was just wondering if other grad students or alumni could offer a bit of advice here...

Is MSCS not valuable anymore due to OMSCS?
I heard GT is offering thousands of people OMSCS degrees  so do they receive same exact diploma as people who do MSCS? MSCS seems like much harder to get in since it follows traditional MS application process where you need research experience, good test scores, recommendations, etc. From my understanding OMSCS is much easier to get in and also much cheaper. If someone's goal is to do MS to join industry is their no advantage in getting MSCS from an elite school like GT if tens of thousands of others are also getting the same diploma more easily and cheaply?

A CS nerd's analysis of r/gatech 🤓
Hey all, today I woke up to the usual meta discussion about r/gatech: namely complaints about people complaining, [such as this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/mpczlg/new_admits_you_wont_find_anything_of_value_on/). I decided to take some time and attempt to actually determine if our dear subreddit is more negative than comparable subs, or if it's about the same. Using Sentiment Analysis, I parsed the 10,000 most recent posts of 6 other similar university subs, calculated the % of strongly positive and negative sentiments expressed in said posts, and listed the results in the table below:

&#x200B;

|University|Positive %|Negative %|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Georgia Tech|25.31| 8.07|
|UCB|27.00|12.32|
|UCLA|25.18|11.32|
|UIUC|26.50|10.52|
|UT Austin|28.92|8.12|
|UMich|28.07|9.66|
|UDub|27.47|9.44|

If you want, you can read about how I generated this data on [my weblog here](https://colby.codes/weblog/sentimentanalysis). Please note: I just parsed the 10,000 most recent posts for each sub and did not weight them by upvotes or anything. **The sole purpose of this analysis was to determine how similar we were to other university subs, nothing more.** I welcome any discussion or thoughts you want to add below - I am by no means well versed in this field, I just thought it would make an interesting project for the day.

In conclusion, it seems like the amount of negative sentiments here is about normal for similar university subreddits, maybe even a bit less than other universities'. Always remember, no matter how down you feel at Georgia Tech, there is always a student at [UCB](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hcslr7/psa_to_any_noncal_student_lurking_this_subreddit/) who is feeling worse lol.

I would also like to end this post with a request to the mods: can you finally enable post flairs so we can filter out topics we don't want to see? I feel as though this would solve so many issues with this sub. Cheers, y'all.

Film Club Seeking Apartment for Short in July
Hello, Jackets!

I'm a member of Buzz Studios Film Club here at Georgia Tech, and we are beginning pre-production on one of our most ambitious short films yet. Our plan is to film this summer in July, and we are currently seeking an apartment on- or off-campus that would be willing to host us to do some of our scenes. We would need access to a bedroom and kitchen. We would stay out of your way as much as possible and are happy to work with your schedule. Plus, all members of the cast and crew will be vaccinated or test negative before coming to set.

If you do have the ability to help us out, please message me! None of our club members will have access to an apartment, so it is vital that we find this set!

Tl;dr: Film club looking for an apartment to film in one weekend in July.

Thanks,

Should I pursue a minor, or start the bs/ms in CS program and graduate early?
So I am a second year CS major and I am planning on taking some summer classes this year. Assuming everything goes as planned, I could finish my degree requirements next spring (this would be a year earlier than expected, as I started fall of 2019). I have two options: I could pursue a minor in economics which would push my BSCS graduation back to next fall, or I could take 5 classes this fall and 5 classes next spring to finish out my degree. I am planning on applying for the BS/MS in CS program either way, but I was wondering if it would be a better use of my time to finish my BS early and hopefully get my MS in spring 2023 (it would probably only take 2 semesters if I take 2 grad classes during my last BS semester). I feel compelled to take this route, but I am concerned that it may not be ideal to try to rush to get everything done so soon (for example, I haven't participated in any internships so far, but I plan on doing one next summer. If I finish my MS the following spring, this would mean I only had one internship throughout the entirety of my BS and MS degrees). I was wondering if anyone may have some advice on which route I should take. Thank you!!!

What are the financial differences between part-time and full time?
I'm out of state, looking to take a 10-credit hour semester but it looks like I will still be paying pretty much the same amount as long as I'm taking more than 6 hours. So why are there 3 separate classifications (less than part time, part-time, and full-time)? What's the difference between part-time and full-time

Hey y'all, I have another survey for my VIP team studying humor. This one is about TikTok's comedy content. Would appreciate anyone who could please fill out this short survey (approximately 2 min long). Thanks!

question about conditional transfer pathway / committing to gatech
hey all, i'm not even co2025 but question: if one is given the conditional transfer pathway, am i free to change my major from what i said I was interested in during applications? (ex. applied showing interest in biology, later want to pursue cs?) i don't know if my interest will stay the same years later, that's all. 

another question: i know if you're admitted to gatech as a whole. does that mean lots of people apply showing interest in a certain major and change it to a different one upon committing?

asking out of curiosity to understand the system a bit more haha. thanks in advance!

PSA: Go Outside 🌸
Hey guys! I know this semester has been pretty hard on all of us. It’s been difficult to get through. Today I set a timer for 15 minutes and went outside and it’s been great for my mental health. So for all of you struggling! It’s not winter anymore it’s a warm, nice day and you should go and experience it!

The EDSBS Charity Bowl supporting the Atlanta-based charity New American Pathways kicks off this week! Georgia Tech finished second last year -- this year, help us take home first prize!
Every year, the college football podcast "The Shutdown Fullcast" run the [EDSBS Charity Bowl](https://twitter.com/edsbs/status/1381578092167192610?s=20), where for 1 week schools try to raise donations for charity in the name of their college football program. The charity is New American Pathways, an Atlanta based charity that helps refugees settle in Georgia - so already, we have a home field advantage. 

The primary winner every year is New American Pathways, obviously, but the secondary winner is the school that has the most money donated in their name. Last year, that team was *almost* Georgia Tech, but the Michigan Money Cannon beat us out. We're not about to let that happen again this year -- for an Atlanta based charity, this is basically a home game for us, so we need to defend our turf.

At any point during this week, donate in Georgia Tech's name to New American Pathways [using this link](https://app.mobilecause.com/e/BzZbrQ?vid=i1skg) with whatever amount of money you want -- some people last year donated just a few dollars, others (including an incredibly generous GT donor) donated $10,000 (!!!). It's generally encouraged to donate in an amount that represents the score of a victory over a heated rival like $28.27 for our 2016 COFH win over u(sic)ga.

Last year, GTAA were giving out autographed footballs to people who donated over a certain threshold. No clue if that's happening again this year but if you're interested in that sort of thing, would advise keeping an eye on [Sean Bedford's](https://twitter.com/SeanBedford79) twitter to see if it is.

Anyways, get donating folks! Everyone knows Georgia Tech is full of and graduates the coolest, most beautiful, and most generous people -- this is our chance to prove it. Donate [using this link](https://app.mobilecause.com/e/BzZbrQ?vid=i1skg) and make sure to list Georgia Tech as the school you're representing. I'll try to post leaderboard updates where I can. Go Jackets!

Arts and Science transfer Pathway question
I was wondering If I have to major in what I would intend to transfer into for my sophomore year as a freshman. I want to do bme but the pathway only allows you to transfer into arts and sciences so I would most likely transfer to bio. Should I start off as a freshman in a different school as bme before transferring so it would be easier for me to transfer after a semester or so after doing bio at gatech? Ive hears it isn't too difficult to change from bio to bme as the department isn't overly crowded.

New admits: you won’t find anything of value on this subreddit, especially now
Maybe I’m just a grumpy old person after seeing this cycle happen for four years but... 

This subreddit is a negative place. And that’s okay. This is a stressful school and reddit doesn’t typically attract happy, positive people. You will not find a good barometer of stress or campus life here. Don’t let this subreddit dissuade you from going here. This sub is also much more active than most college subreddits. 

I think this is especially worse during admission season, and this year. COVID aside, this sub is always more negative at this point in the year. It’s the end of the spring semester and people are burnt out. Even fall on this sub can be a happier time because there’s sports and events to discuss. 

Mods, can we make some kind of wiki or disclaimer about common concerns on this subreddit? i.e., this sub is not representative of a GT experience, GT doesn’t experience a higher rate of student death, etc

There’s a lot of other gripes I could go into but this is one that’s been popping up a lot. Excuse me for being an old man yelling at clouds. It’s time for me to graduate...
--------------------------------------------------
Some words of encouragement for those who need them
It goes without saying that this semester has been horrific. Since GT’s mental health services are severely lacking, I wanted to write a little something that’ll hopefully make your day a little bit easier.

For those struggling with imposter syndrome/feeling insecure: As we head into another Monday, I want to remind you that you deserve to be here; your abilities, intellect, determination, courage, and strength have gotten you here and have kept you going. I am so proud of you for that. You are so capable, despite what that voice in your head keeps saying. I know it’s way easier said that done, but comparing yourself to others is painful and unhelpful. Please remember that it’s a marathon, not a sprint! You’ll get exactly where you need to go; I have faith in you.

For those battling anxiety: Please take a few deep breaths for me. Take a break from what you’re doing, go for a quick walk or call a friend. I know how much stress you’re under, and I know that it feels endless. You’re almost there, the end of the semester is only a few weeks away. Take care of yourself to the best of your ability; ask for that extension or treat yourself to something nice. You have been working so hard and you deserve a break! Lastly, I know how terrifying grades can be. But please remember that your health and well-being come first. When it’s all said and done, grades are only numbers; your brain and body have gotten you this far, they deserve to be prioritized! I know it sounds cliche, but life always has a way of working itself out. 

For those fighting depression: I know it feels like there’s no light at the end of the tunnel, but I am so proud of you for holding on and doing what you can. You are doing your best, and for that I think you are spectacularly strong. Please remember to eat and hydrate. If you can, try taking a shower or brushing your teeth! If that’s too much, then that’s totally ok. Every accomplishment you’ve made deserves to be celebrated, even if it’s just waking up this morning! I know things seem impossible right now, but it will not always be this way. You will make it through this; life will get better! You deserve wonderful things, and they’re going to come to you in time. I have faith in you.

For those struggling with self-harm/suicidal thoughts/severe mental illnesses: I am so proud that you are still here. Your presence on this planet enriches the lives of everyone around you every single day. Please reach out to someone about how you feel. Whether it’s a friend, a partner, a relative, a professor, a TA, there are people who care very deeply about you and want to help you in any way they can. If you feel like you don’t have anyone else, please dm me. I value your life so much and am always here to talk. In the meantime, if you feel like self-harming, hold an ice cube in your hand (trust me, it works!). Things will get better, and I know how hard it is to believe that, but I promise they will. You are amazing, and once again, I am so proud of you.

For those in marginalized communities/fighting activist burnout: I am so sorry. You deserve so much better than how this country has treated you (and that is a gross understatement). I can only imagine how hard it must be to watch people in your community die everyday or get systematically stripped of their rights. I cannot put into words how amazingly strong and powerful you are for fighting for your rights and the rights of others. Please remember, though, to take breaks and prioritize your mental health. Activist burnout is real and I know how much you want to contribute and make your voice heard (rightfully so!) but in order to make your full impact, you have to be well-rested! Take care of yourself as much as possible. I can’t imagine how terrifying it is to watch your rights get taken away, but please please please get the rest you rightfully deserve. You have allies who are more than happy to take up the mantle while you recuperate. I am firmly in your corner; I admire you and am so proud of you. 

For anyone else I missed/wasn’t able to mention: You are magnificent. Your strength and courage are an inspiration to so many people. The semester is almost over and I know that you are going to make it through and that everything will be alright! Life can be really scary, especially in the middle of a pandemic, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel and you are going to make it through and be able to feel the sunlight on your face again. Keep going, and remember to take care of yourself as much as you can. I am so proud of you.

Sorry for writing a book, I just hope this helps anyone who needs it. My dms are always open, rain or shine. Whether you need to vent, get something off your chest, advice, anything, I am happy to help and would be willing to listen. I hope everyone has a wonderful day/week/month/etc. Best of luck everyone.

Is this place outta CTRL or is it me?
Any one else feel like they are about to low-key loose their mind? I never wanted to go home for the summer so badly before. They tell you to go to CARE for help. The problem with CARE is that they don't care; all keep handing you off to other staff in the department in an infinite loop. I feel like I'm being unheard and its building up a riot in my mind. The only way I get through a night is alcohol. As much as I did not want to share those details, this is my only way to vent cause I got nobody but family 700 mi away. In the end, these professors must understand this craziness and provide some leniency with our grades. I'm tired of walking back from the library passed 2 am almost every night (except Fridays) to get a, bag over the head, 50% on an exam. I hope I'm not the only one living in these lonely, isolated, overworked, depressed shoes?

Is it difficult/time consuming to just walk everywhere (since classes seem to be not too close together)?

Transferring into Tech for IE
Questions about transferring

Hey, I just had a couple of questions regarding transferring in as an Industrial Engineer into tech. I got deferred early and rejected regular this year. Currently, I have two options for in-state

* KSU Honors for Industrial Engineering and I transfer to tech
* UGA Honors for Mechanical Engineering (because UGA doesn't offer IE), and transfer to tech and then transfer majors

What college would be the better option?

Can I be a ME at UGA and then apply to tech as an IE?

Question about invention studio
TLDR: I’m trying to make something similar to a challenge coin for my brothers 20th birthday, and I feel Ike it could be done using the equipment in there, but idk where to start and do any engineering majors/manufacturing folks have an tips

So my brother is an EMT in Dekalb, and we grew up military, so there’s always been an importance of challenge coins in our lives. I had a good hand in raising him and I try not to think about the amount of times he’s been shot at while I sit at home writing code. He turns 20 soon and I’d like to get him something special that he can have on duty just to know if he gets himself killed I’ll resurrect him to beat his ass to death, but having a one off made is just too damn expensive, and I feel like I could do it in the invention studio. Here comes my issue, I’m just your friendly neighborhood CM major, and while I can design graphics and make it look good, I really don’t know the right tool to use, how to begin learning how to use it, safety and efficiency, how much detail can realistically be produced, or even how the invention studio works on campus. I was wondering if any engineering folks could point me in the right direction, and maybe help me look like 10% less of an idiot when I’m not anonymous on Reddit.

EDIT: Am I even allowed to use these resources for non course related, non scientific, personal projects?

Let's all be inclusive to our CS Newcomers!
I have a friend that's wanting to switch majors to CS after discovering an interest in programming from their 1371 class. This past day, their expression of interest in programming was met with "but MATLAB isn't a real programming language; it's just a glorified calculator." And this was definitely not the first or second time I overheard a similar response.

I get that it's a common sentiment amongst CS majors and programming enthusiasts that MATLAB can be quite wacky compared to traditional languages (lol aRrAyS sTaRt aT iNdEx 1). However, I dont believe such differences give us the gravitas to discourage others who are starting their programming pursuits with this language. Not only are MATLAB fundamentals very much applicable to fundamentals of programming in general (conditionals, looping, classes, etc.), but if you think about it, any programming language is a "glorified calculator" in the sense that code is mathematical operations on data at some level.

So please, instead of meeting our 1371 friends with disgust over their introduction to coding with this language, let's encourage them to pursue their interests!

Engineer wavering between T&M program and CS minor
Pretty much title; I was accepted to the Denning T&M program as an engineer but after taking a deep look at the program and my current career goals, I'm not sure if I would be better served continuing with it or taking on another minor (namely CS). My ultimate goal is to gain both industry experience and eventually found a startup, but I'm not specifically interested in any of the corporate partners that T&M has. However, I know the program has a ton of extra perks and connections, and still gives overall business knowledge. On the other hand, a CS or other minor could give a lot of directly useful skills. Can anybody who's doing one or the other give me some pros and cons from their experience?

Meal plan: Everyday or Weekday
Hi, I'm an incoming freshman for 21-22, and I was wondering which of the meal plans I should choose.

Everyday has access to the dining halls all days a week, + 7 meal exchange swipes/week and $250 dining dollars.

Weekday has access to the dining halls 5 a week, + 5 meal exchange swipes/week and $450 dining dollars.

The website doesn't explain very well how often dining dollars are added to the account and what a meal exchange swipe is. For the weekday plan, is it $450 per semester or per year? Also, does a meal exchange swipe count as one meal or multiple meals in a day?

Thanks in advance!

some small yet bothersome things that affect my perception of this school
**socially**:

* some people are absolutely normal, social people yet become isolated from campus community. witnessed this a few times. personally experiencing it.

* other people come to GT but are literally singletons because of who they are: grew up poor and can't relate to others, too unattractive for others to reach out to them yet shy at the same time, mentally handicapped (this one is not about me fyi, these are just things I've seen)

I've noticed people like the above a lot and it bothers me because it seems like they're suffering a lot due to who they are and nobody else seems to notice these singletons. tbh I think most people are classist to some degree but don't admit it or these peoples' existence doesn't bother them, but I'm a person who's a classist, aware of it, and kind of hates it to be honest

a public school due to its size naturally leads to what I mentioned, and I think I'd be happier at a school that doesn't have its population split into half nerd, half sports game, because both sides are really not getting what they want


**administratively**:

* the quality and care put into the monitors on 3rd floor price gilbert is horrendous. they're literally loose and dangling there. that floor's opening has been delayed by weeks and weeks. I feel like a school's experience is capped by how good its administrative staff is, and it makes me sad that it's not up to par with the Georgia Tech student.

* at least talking with people at other places, the food here is bad and overpriced. students shouldn't be forced to overpay or spend an entire day meal prepping shitty frozen food because it detracts from their main need of studying, networking, and working

**I'm tired of people repeating the same thing about school**:

* it's academically challenging - no it's not, undergrad courses aren't that difficult, it's that the teaching here isn't up to par, students don't get face to face time with an advisor, and I feel like each course is 1/3 people who care, 1/3 getting by, 1/3 dgaf when the former two should be prevalent

there's no way that georgia tech is a prestigious school based on my experiences, and maybe I'm a part of the problem. the school's too big. it's too easy for students to get lost in here. and it's not worth it if you don't have friends

Why on earth should I pay 210$ for state tax after filing my taxes?
Hey everyone, sorry if this message is not related to the subreddit. I really didn't know where else I can ask it. 

So I am an international graduate student.  I filed my taxes with Sprintax, I entered the W-2 form information and I ended up owing 210$ for state tax and just getting 30$ for federal tax. Is that correct? I thought every Gatech student gets some refund after filing their taxes, I wonder why it's not true for me. I really appreciate your help.

That Cafe in Proximity to Exhibition Hall
Okay so check this out,

While I was looking around at a map since my coworker is finally gonna get vaccinated, I noticed something that says Cafe and it's right across or nearby Exhibition Hall where the vaccines are taking place and the sad eateries are (I'm looking at you, Panda). 

I wanna know, does this place have good food? I might stop by tomorrow for my lunch break and since tomorrow is payday I'm willing to throw down some serious cash on some serious food.

Research(MS) at Tech
Hi y'all! 
This might be a long shot but does anybody have any suggestions how to look for a 'good' PI for a master's thesis (in CS) ? 
I know the process that I look at the prof's research and reach out to them, etc.. But my main concern is how do I actually find a prof who would support me even if I am a bit slow at research initially. 

I had a horrible GRA experience during the first year of my grad school and that has left me feeling extremely under-confident at doing any kind of research. That took a big toll on my mental health as well. 

I am a bit inexperienced when it comes to research, but i have finished all my coursework now and I am ready to dedicate all the time of the upcoming semesters into my research. I am so traumatized by my last research experience that at this point of time, I am just looking for profs who are supportive in the initial stage even if their research is not my primary field of interest. I am not even trying to look for a funding at this point. All I want to do is some good research before I leave Tech. 

Any inputs (suggestions/supportive labs, etc) are appreciated.

cheap/second-hand cycle for campus navigation?
hi y'all, incoming freshman here. anyone know where i can pick up a second-hand cycle for cheap? 

i've never bought one before and not sure where i can look for a second-hand one.  appreciate any input anyone can provide !

also, do most people use personal transport like cycles, skateboards and the such, or is campus transport sufficient? i've heard horror stories about the buses 😔
--------------------------------------------------
So.... 🎉🍹 how’s the social life
How’s the social scene at Tech? y’all get a bad rap for being the not so social but i hope that’s not the case. someone tell me about the social scene (& if it’s possible without greek life/how prominent greek life is) at tech because i’m planning on committing !! thanks xoxo

Interested in mock CS interviews for internships?
Look no further! Sometime over the next two weeks, the **GT CS Careers Club** will be hosting a mock interview session. We will create a script for the interviewers and choose two LeetCode questions beforehand. Once students join, they will be assigned into pairs where they can take turns interviewing and being interviewed. Afterwards, we will briefly go over the answers to both LeetCode questions as a group.            

If this sounds like something you would be interested in, [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/aF2S6AzrAP) to help us find a good time to host the event! See the #announcements channel for the LettuceMeet link and invite your friends. Even if you already have an internship for the summer, it never hurts to get in some extra practice: we all know the more competitive internships for Summer 2022 will be opening within 2 months anyways.

South American Study Abroad

Recently Founded a Trading Club (Equities, Futures, Etc.) here at Georgia Tech - Anyone Interested?
Recently I've started a Trading Club here at Georgia Tech that will really be kicking off in the Fall but wanted to start off with some informal recruiting over the Spring and Summer Semesters. The club is mainly a discussion-based forum to meet with like-minded students around campus and bounce ideas off each other. We don't manage capital and any trades you make are at your own discretion with your own capital, but as I've experienced it's always nice to bounce ideas off others and think about things from many different viewpoints when trading and investing in general. The club is mainly focused on short-term discretionary swing trades, shorter-term fundamentals and technicals, and individual learning.

I know a few people who want to pursue careers in trading whether it be quantitative on the CS/STEM side of things or Discretionary/HFT/Market-Making side of things and some of these skills just aren't covered in a few other clubs or never went too far into depth with campus involvement to be widely known. I'm hoping to change that in the Fall by detailing some of my own experiences and helping share my knowledge of the markets and hopefully learn from some of our members as well. I hope to cover all things trading throughout the semester and hope to host a few competitions here at GT similar to the trading competitions at UChicago, and network with a few alumni and nearby connections I've made with a few traders at Proprietary Shops to help new students and even current students learn about a career in trading.

Here's the new engage page that was just formed and approved by SAC to become a registered student organization. We currently have 2 dozen members and haven't had a formal recruiting progress or anything alongside that nature yet but want to gauge some more interest and maybe start something up over the summer or end of the semester informally before starting off in the fall.

Any questions you might have feel free to ask and I'd love to go more in-depth about discussing the club. Over the summer I'll be focusing on developing a small overall resource page to learn some things on your own if you're not to experienced but wish to learn, and hope to start discussing opportunities in the Fall.

How is the psychology program?
Hello guys! I’m trying to transfer into tech next year for a psychology major and I’m wondering if any current/alumni students have any tips or comments on the program? Anything at all would help, whether that be professor recommendations or telling me to run for my life lol.

 I don’t have a concrete plan but I kinda want to try to get into the FBI so I’m hoping this degree would help with that? Any recommendations would be greatly accepted for that side as well, with the FBI or if you have any other job ideas haha.

Thanks for reading! I hope you all have a good day :)

Ice Cream Vending Machine, We Lost a Friend Today

Y’all I am exhausted
Just a vent post, but these next few weeks feel impossible.  I know we’re almost done, and I will finish, but shit I am running on fumes.  I worked a lot in February and March, and due to my own idiotic fault I work the entire weekend before finals.  I’m also a trans guy, and y’all everything going on in Arkansas and also if you didn’t know we have the same bill in the legislature in GA, I just feel like I can’t take fighting for trans kids and going to school.  I think that is what is wearing on me the most.  As any minority knows waking up and watching your rights debated on a national level is just so hard to bear, and I gotta do finals through all of this?  Its just hard.  Thank you for coming to my vent session, good luck on finals and take care of yourselves y’all.

Quick question — should we be continuing to get tested after we have been vaccinated twice?
Just got my second vaccine this week, wasn’t sure if that would cause any kind of false positive when being tested weekly via Tech’s saliva test. Would love any guidance here!

We need more native plants at GT (and to remove invasives)
Hi everyone,

Lately I've really enjoying walking around campus and looking at lots of nice trees/plants like redbuds, dogwoods, azaleas (a mix of native and nonnative), oakleaf hydrangeas, buckeyes, and many others. Walking towards the CRC between ISyE and the Instructional Center I couldn't help but notice a number of non-native invasive species (nandina, mahonia, english ivy, etc.). I know that around new buildings like the Kendeda Building they have planted mostly native but I wish we could make it a priority to get rid of some of the invasives even if there isn't new construction.

Will GT make getting the COVID vaccine mandatory for everyone for next Fall?
I’ve been reading how few colleges have been making it mandatory for all students (except for those who have a strong reaction to the vaccine). It also makes sense for GT to do so since getting vaccinated will keep everyone safer on campus and the COVID testing program is essentially mandatory already.

Edit: Ok I was wrong about the testing being mandatory but it's still heavily encouraged

fintech opportunities at gtech?
hi!

i recently got admitted to scheller and i am heavily considering tech. i want to do something in fintech- blockchain, digital currency, algorithmic trading, that kind of stuff. i'm worried that none of the scheller concentrations will give me that scope to my education, and none of the minors seem to cover those areas either. can anyone at gtech and/or in scheller give some input on this? i realllly love this school, i just wanna make sure i'll be getting the education i want. 

thanks :)

Postgrad GPA reset
Let's say a GT grad has a low GPA but want's to go into a profession that requires more schooling, think law,med school,accounting. Can that student apply for readmission for a 4 year degree even though they already have a GT degree and would that student be able to get a GPA reset ?

Would a 4.0 be possible or do all previously earned credits apply and would all grades be shown on the transcript even though there were for the previous major.

Opinion: There should be an Epilepsy warning in front of the Amygdala exhibit
Many of you have probably seen it, but there is a new art exhibit in front of the Ferst Center and Flag building which is very cool and beautiful. There is a portion of the exhibit that flashes white light extremely fast. I am not epileptic, but I'm sure people with the condition would have a bad day if they visited this exhibit. With no warnings posted, kinda seems like a lawsuit waiting to happen. That being said, it is very cool and you should go check it out.
--------------------------------------------------
appreciation post
i did a [rant](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/lfvmz0/rant_about_an_inconsiderate_instructor/) sometime back about one of my professor only fair that we recognize goodness too (albeit different professor). mark riedl deserves a nobel peace prize regardless tbh.

this is what he did:

Hi all.

A bit more than a year ago Georgia Tech closed campus due to COVID-19. We are about to conclude our second (or third if you did summer) semester of remote instruction. We are all exhausted. A bit more than a year ago when campus closed, I truncated the assignments, making a bunch of regular assignments into extra credit or canceled assignments outright. There are no surprises this year, we knew going into this semester what to expect. But now that we are here, I can sense the tiredness in the class. I can sense the tiredness in myself. So here is what we are going to do about it.

1. I will give you until Friday to complete take-home exam 2
2. I will extend homework 5 until April 23rd.
3. Exam 3 will be canceled.
4. Homework 6 will be shortened and made optional (submit for extra credit). It will be due on April 30, essentially replacing exam 3.

\*\*

the email goes on in logistical details but some highlights:

\- I had not prepared you sufficiently and exam 2 is turning into a major assignment. I have put a lot of my personal focus into answering questions on Piazza. I have found it worthwhile to help you all work through the exercise. The fact that it as turned into a major undertaking for some is my fault and I take responsibility for it. If this exercise is going to become a major assignment, then you all don't need another official homework assignment or another exam.

\- My compromise is to do what I did a year ago, which is make the assignment extra credit. It is really good, and a really practical assignment for anyone who might want to work in AI after graduation. I strongly encourage you to do the extra credit assignment. I would totally understand why you didn't.

\- Why did I cancel the exam 3? Because we are tired.

\- You are doing an admirable job if you are even just getting along. It is not my job to create unnecessary stress. While I think it is essential to pull back on some of the educational goals on this class, the important learning opportunities are still available to those who can partake.

Does anyone want to share a storage unit for this upcoming summer?
I have some stuff which isn't worth taking back with me, but it seems it isn't worth the price of storage either. So i was wondering if someone wants to share a storage unit too so to make it cheaper?

Appreciation Post for Great Professors
I know that this subreddit typically contains people venting about various classes and professors who aren't understanding. I just wanted to take a second and share my experiences with a couple of my professors this semester and give them some recognition for how amazing they've been. If anyone has other stories about good professors, feel free to share. I understand that not everyone has been lucky enough to have professors who are understanding, so also feel free to shame too.

First up is **Daniel Molzahn** who teaches ECE 4320/4321. He's an awesome lecturer but has really made an effort to make sure that the class is not stressing students out during an already stressful time. He has hosted various outdoor in-person meetups for test reviews to try and meet with students face-to-face. But, if students were not comfortable with this, or just couldn't attend, he then hosted a virtual review session the day after. In addition, he has made tests take-home over a period of three days. He made the tests more comprehensive since we had more time for the exam, but he didn't make them unfair. After every exam, he always makes sure to get student feedback and will make sure that he isn't putting too much stress on us during this time.

Another professor I've had this semester is **Nivedita Bhattacharya** who teaches ECE 3150. I don't know her as personally as I do Daniel Molzahn, but her class notes are very well written for students who can't attend live lectures and she does a great job answering student questions during lectures. But she has been super understanding about the stress we're under. Here's a recent note she sent out to the class. "As we move into the final month of instruction for Spring’21, I wanted to drop a quick note. I know many of you are feeling a lot of pressure with all the homeworks, exams and projects piling up. If you feel overwhelmed at any point, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me. I will try my best to make sure you don’t feel as stressed about our assignments and deadlines and feel more confident with the material. Learning should be fun and I want to keep it that way without making you feel burdened with the work load. Take care and best of luck!!"
When I needed a homework extension because of a hell week, she gave it to me quickly and offered to set up extra office hours if I needed help.

Finally, I've seen **Benjamin Yang** mentioned on here a couple of times, but he really is the GOAT. I'm taking him for ECE 3025. Again, he is an amazing lecturer and professor, but he's also just a great human being. He has been super flexible with assignment due-dates, made tests take home so we could complete them on our own time, and has reached out to students individually to make sure they're doing okay. He has been super understanding both in-class and out-of-class. If you have an opportunity to take him, don't hesitate to do it.

Again, I know not everyone has good professors this semester so if you wanted to vent about that, feel free. But I was also hoping to hear from some other people about their experiences with awesome professors. As much as we like to shit on everything bad at Tech (which there is a lot), I think the people who make Tech great could use a little recognition.

Double Charged for a Semester, anyone to contact besides Bursar?
 Hi all looks like GaTech charged me for classes I didn't take and put a hold on my account. I paid half, before realizing something didn't add up about the debits/credits.  


Tried to call bursar but they only do email. Is there any other office I can contact about this? Via email Bursar first told me that I wasn't debited for charges in Fall 2020, which wasn't true, and then in the very next email said it was for Summer 2020 classes, which I didn't attend. No acknowledgement that they just changed their story  


 If it's for Summer 2021, I should not have any sort of hold, bc I was 

1. able to sign up for Summer 21 classes a week ago and had no hold and 

2. it's simply not due yet. No hold if it's not past due.  


Is there anywhere to lodge a complaint as well? They are wasting my time trying to get my own money back from them

Drop deadline exception?
This semester has been very difficult for me and has taken a toll on my mental and physical health. The pandemic and online format has not been much help. Long story short, I have recently been informed from my professor that it will not be possible for me to pass the course. My professor told me he does not know what I should do and my adviser informed me that I should prioritize my other classes and plan to take it some time in the summer. Is ignoring the course and failing and taking it some other time really the best thing I can do at the moment?
--------------------------------------------------
Anyone wish for online course delivery methods in the future?
I can't wait to go back to in person classes, however a part of me still wishes that some courses would have the option of being taken as either remote async or sync. I know that gatech had online sections for some courses even before the pandemic, and I was hoping that more classes (some of the large upper level required courses especially) would have such options be made available for students now that the 'infrastructure' is there and that everyone is some what used to it. This is especially helpful for me during the summer since I was able to work while taking classes last summer and do the same this summer. I didn't come in with a lot of credits so being able to take one or two courses over the summer remotely while working helps me spread out classes while gaining work experience.
--------------------------------------------------
I’m going to miss this school...
I’m graduating soon and I'm going to be working full time while starting my part time masters program in another state in the Fall. I’m going to miss the friends I made here, late night dorm convos, going to parties with with random people from North Avenue that you'd never talk to after first year, crecine, the sem co-op, the green, Crosland, the food trucks, walking down Ferst in late spring, sitting in the CULC the first day of Fall when its absolutely packed, staying up until Rays opened to get food and then promptly crashing. I’m even going to miss spending the whole night in Skiles working on problem sets and cold days in the winter. I’m going to miss discovering new places even after being here for four years, the workouts in CRC, and the late night walks downtown. This city is beautiful and I’ve made so many amazing memories here on campus.

Sounds cliche as hell but for all of you still here, savor your time when you can.
--------------------------------------------------
just me or is this semester more busy than any other ever
not sure if its pandemic fatigue or online class effect or because of shorter semester (and no spring break..) but like things just keep happening, faster than ever, and at a pace its impossible to keep up with.

i know we see a lot of these posts, but is this semester especially bad for others as well?

also how are you coping? i tried sleeping on my problems but they didnt go away :/

Engineering science and Mechanics
Is there anyone on this sub that is currently pursuing a master's degree in Engineering science and mechanics or anyone who has information on this degree program? 

It is offered by the college of civil and Environmental Engineering but I can't seem to find any information on it?
--------------------------------------------------
How bad is the mental health at Tech?
I’m an incoming freshman majoring in EE browsing this sub and all I see are posts talking about how people can’t take it anymore... I’m kinda scared for yall and myself lol. Is it also possible to keep up a social life while majoring in engineering because the course load sounds like a lot :(
--------------------------------------------------
Website of Student Projects?
Georgia Tech has a lot of interesting clubs and different breeds of geeks, so I'm just curious if our school has a sort of instructable-like page where students can contribute to certain projects (drone building, Invention Studio instructions, programming projects, sports maybe). I know that you can Google all of these things, but I feel like there being one common location where GT students can go to find this info would be useful, so I'm just asking.
--------------------------------------------------
Is there a career fair for the college of sciences?
Just curious... I’ve searched around but literally all of the results are for the CoC, and after four years here I’ve never seen one advertised.

If you're a TA, please do consider checking your classes' Piazza
I can't believe I'm making a post like this. I just found out the only TA for one of my classes not only was not checking the piazza for my class, they had not even joined it until members of the class had to reach out to them to answer a pressing piazza question via email.

I realize for some courses piazza isn't really used, but for courses where it's clearly stated to be the BEST method of communication with the course administrators (like this one), for the love of the gods, please check it. 

Not trying to throw any shade with this, I just felt incredibly frustrated when I found this out and want to prevent other people from experiencing that. Pls. Consider my words. Gn.

Hi guys. I just got admitted for Ece masters at Ga Tech. I'm kinda confused with the covid policies of the grad school.

How to get a course with a full waitlist
Hey r/gatech,

I was caught off guard by how early fall registration started (Last year I registered in the summer as an incoming freshman) and ended up not registering for classes until a day after my time ticket. Unfortunately, by being a day late, several important prerequisites are completely capped with full waitlists. I've been refreshing these courses all day (once every 10 minutes or so) to check for open spots. However, when a spot opens in the class, meaning that when the next person in line on the waitlist has to accept the spot, I will come back to see that by the time that person accepts the course spot, their spot in the waitlist has already been filled.

Basically, it's super competitive to get on the waitlist for a full course, and doing so would essential require me to be constantly refreshing my computer every 10 minutes (even that might not be enough) for the next few days to even hope that I might get on the waitlist. There must be some more convenient way to do this. I know coursicle sends you notifications, but that's only for one course if you don't pay. Has anyone made a script that notifies you of a course spot opening?
--------------------------------------------------
Probably a first world problem, but I just want to be able to attend virtual lectures/do schoolwork outside (when the weather is nice) without getting kicked off the internet every 30 seconds.
That is all.
--------------------------------------------------
When are commencement tickets being distributed? (Because my gatech email got deleted after graduating)
I was looking at the site and it says seating reservations begin April 8th for the undergrad ceremony, does but does that mean tickets are distributed same day? I'm asking because My gatech email got deleted after I graduated and I only set up email forwarding about a month ago, so if they already sent out emails I may not have gotten it. They said to save the confirmation email for your records, but again my confirmation email was sent to a non-existent email address so I'm worried if that will cause problems, I RSVP'd already.

Pisses me off that everyone uploads their HW code to github
Literally makes no sense either. What company is going to look through your shitty GitHub repos, see that you put your two brain cells together to finish your god damn HOMEWORK, and be impressed? It serves no purpose other than giving away the answers. 

Now if it's a project of sorts, I have no issues but don't upload straight-up "#TODO insert code here" assignments. Many classes clearly state in the syllabus and honor code that you should not upload your classes to public repositories. If you're using it as a place to store stuff, just make it private. Come on guys, don't make it so easy for people to cheat when you worked hard on your code for your degree. 

Now for the university's part: why can't we just honor code these guys? The repos almost always have their name attached to them.

Internship + Classes Question
Hi all, 

I have an opportunity to do a full-time internship (40 hrs/week) in the Fall of 2021. However, I was considering doing a part-time load of 6 credits to stay on track to graduate on time. Has anybody here ever done this before? If so, what was your experience?

For additional context, I am a CS major and I was planning to take HTS2037 (20th Century Europe) and CS4400 (Intro to Database Systems). Note: If CS4400 is too heavy, I can also switch it out for PSYC2210 (Social Psychology) or a free elective.

Housing as a conditional transfer
Hi guys, I'm planning on transferring to gatech for Fall 2021, but considering transfer pathway students get decisions on June 15th, how does housing work? Am I expected to find off campus housing or something like that? Thanks for any help!

Summer co op at gtri

An Open Letter to Georgia Tech Basketball
Dear Georgia Tech Men's and Women's Basketball:

Thank you.

Thank you for a special season that many may not have seen coming.

Thank you for a season that saw your squads advance to the NCAA tournaments.

Thank you Men's Basketball for netting an ACC Championship.

Thank you Women's Basketball for rewarding us with a deep tournament run and keeping up with number-1-seeded South Carolina.

But most of all...

Thank you for showing the rest of the NCAA that keeping talent at home and developing them into a formidable force over time can still make for competitive teams and a legacy of excellence that will continue throughout the future.

This year we had a special group of seniors.  Lorela Cubaj, Kierra Fletcher, Jose Alvarado, and Moses Wright: you guys have done great things on the Flats and have anchored a stellar group of upperclassmen that have contributed immensely to both the present success and the future potential of the basketball programs here at Georgia Tech.  Your hard work and dedication to success will leave an indelible impact upon your peers, your coaching staff, and us fans as we eagerly anticipate what awaits us in the years to come.

I know that the COVID mess last year has resulted in you guys earning an extra year of eligibility and a chance to potentially return next year to build on this past year's successes.  If you choose to come back, we will eagerly welcome you back with open arms.  And if you choose to move on, we will watch your careers with pride safe in the knowledge that the blood, sweat, and tears you have invested during your at time at Tech will translate to continued success in your futures.

But no matter what path you may choose to take, we thank you for all that you have done.  Good luck in your future endeavors....

....and with your noble character, you will develop a new permanence in life.

GO JACKETS!!!!!

Happy Easter, GT. He is Risen.

Perhaps on this day of celebration of resurrection, my prayers for my stat grade to be lifted out of the dirt will be answered 🙏

Missed Connection
I was the tall guy in all black in the library. You were in a brown sweater. We exchanged a few glances before I had to leave to go get boba. But after I left I noticed my number of connections on Novid^(TM) didn't go up.

If this was you maybe we could meet up again and form a close connection? 👉👈

Best East Campus Housing Community
Which of the east campus housing have the best communities?

I heard a lot about Glenn and Towers having the best housing space, but what about the communities? Does Smith really have the tightest community?
--------------------------------------------------
Life outside campus tips (markets, nightlife, outdoors, farmer's market, skateparks, etc)
So I'm a pretty urban dude and am trying to decide between GT and UIUC  (AE PhD, leaning towards the former).

Imagine those golden times when  there were no covid at first -- what are y'all favorite things to do up  there?

Then considering covid, how lame it's been?

Looking for people who...
took Differential Equations last year in 2020? Would like to get some feedback!

Study Opportunity
I’m a graduate student at Tech working on my Master's project. My teammates and I have designed a sound-based virtual coworking platform and we're looking to evaluate it with undergrads and graduate students who have experience visiting public spaces with others around (libraries, coffee shops, etc.) to study or do their work.

If you're interested in volunteering, you will participate in a two-part research study. The two sessions will take place on separate days, and each session will last up to 1.5 hours max. You will be asked to complete three different tasks while using the virtual coworking space and a comparable system. With your permission, we will also ask you to take a screen recording and screenshots while using our system for a small portion of the session. At the end, you will answer questions about your experience with using our system.

We expect to enroll up to 20 participants for this study. Participants will be compensated $15 for the first session and $20 for the second session, totaling $35 for the entire study. Compensation will be provided in the form of an Amazon gift card. If you or someone you know is interested in participating in this research project, please complete this 3-minute eligibility survey: [https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_5yCsTWmulgjXkWi](https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5yCsTWmulgjXkWi)

Grad/undergrad crosslisted courses
Are crosslisted courses are supposed to be offered at the same time/mode? I noticed CS 4641 is being offered by Rooz 9:30-10:45am and in-person, but CS 7641 is being offered 12:30-1:45 pm and it's listed as remote synchronous.
--------------------------------------------------
Registration Fall sem
Hi,  
I remember that I looked up the courses for Fall some time ago and the Special Topic course for blockchain was listed there. But it doesn't seem to be listed now. Was it removed?

Digital Design / VLSI
Hi, prospective Georgia Tech MS ECE here.

I  want to work in the digital design and VLSI field after graduation. I  was wondering whether there are many job opportunities in this field.  How difficult is it to get a job in this field and which companies  recruit for digital design or computer architecture from Georgia Tech?

After completing my Bachelors in ECE (I'm an international student), there were not many opportunities in the hardware side so I had to  settle for a Software Engineer position. I'm worried that I might end up in a similar situation.

Thanks in advance. This will help me a lot!

RIP Starbucks Clough (at least for now)

Georgia Tech Course Materials
I would like to get a headstart on a few ECE, MATH, and PHYS courses. Are there any websites/links or online pdfs that provide course materials such as textbook pdfs, lecture notes, or video/audio recordings of lectures?
--------------------------------------------------
Why are there completely in person Maymester courses being offered but every single Integral Calc class for Fall on Oscar is listed as fully online???
Someone please tell me I’m dumb and missing something here. If integral is completely online I’m literally going to KMS
--------------------------------------------------
How safe is the Campus?
1- How safe is GT campus back in normal days? 

2- Was there a lot of burglary between students or was it safe enough?
--------------------------------------------------
Does Georgia Tech have fully online course for Computer engineering master degree ?
Hi,

I have master degree in Computer science/IT in Australia. I’m really interested in Computer engineering lately and would like to pursue that at Georgia Tech. But I can only study online. Can anyone tell me if the uni is offering online master degree. If yes, then am I eligible for that course given that my bachelor degree is not STEM major but my master is.
--------------------------------------------------
Gym in the summer
If you aren’t taking classes in the summer, are you still able to go to the campus gym?
--------------------------------------------------
Any other upcoming fifth years out there?
starting to get tired of this place

Invention Studio
Will the invention studios be open during the summer?

Apply to the Effective Altruism Fellowship! (by Sunday April 4th 11:59 PM PDT)
Starting in mid-April, Stanford Effective Altruism is hosting the **Effective Altruism Fellowship**, which helps students figure out **how we can do the most good with our lives** (and particularly careers) — by introducing the ideas and applications of effective altruism: combining evidence and compassion to find the best opportunities for improving the world. Topics include preventing the next pandemic, climate change, mass incarceration, nuclear war, global poverty, transformative AI, and animal welfare. We will also discuss criticisms and uncertainties about effective altruism. The eight-week fellowship will feature speaker events, 1-on-1 mentorship, and career workshops for us to think through how we can increase our positive impact with our careers, time, donations, and other resources.

**Apply here** (due Sunday, April 4, 11:59pm PDT, but it’s super quick and easy to apply): [https://airtable.com/shr1eDEVCPeBw9M1j](https://airtable.com/shr1eDEVCPeBw9M1j)

The key topics in the fellowship are:

* **Measuring impact** (qualitatively and quantitatively) – how to do the most good with our resources
* **Global health and poverty** – e.g., (sub)tropical disease eradication in developing regions
* **Factory farming** – how should we evaluate and address animal suffering?
* **Longtermism** – how should we take into account the well-being of future generations?
* **Global catastrophic risks** – with a focus on AI safety, pandemic risks, climate change, and nuclear risks

For more info, there will be a fellowship info session and Intro to Effective Altruism on Sunday, April 4 at 3–4 PM EDT:
