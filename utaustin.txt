AP Calculus BC credit to Calc 2/M 408D?
Hello I'm an incoming freshman slated to attend UT fall 2021 for electrical engineering. AP exams start in two days and I've been stressing. so I looked up the AP credit chart for UT, which caused a couple questions to come up. mainly, it seems I'm unable to skip M 408D (Calc 2 ?). and from the course plan I found, it seems my major (at least) does not require any of the classes that you can skip by getting a 5 on the AP cal BC exam ( M 408K and M 408L; or M 408N and M 408S; or M 408R and M 408L; or M 408R and M 408S ). Is this the case or am I thoroughly confused?

Many Thanks in Advance!

Has anyone had experience living at the Quarters Cameron/Montgomery recently?
 

I am currently considering living at Quarters Cameron/Montgomery, and I was wondering if anyone has recent experience living here? Are the model rooms that they show in the tour similar in quality to actual rooms? Despite what I heard about being kicked out due to renovations, did you have any major complaints about the apartment such as noise, weird fees, maintenance, etc , or was living here smooth without any issues?

How should I space out my Pre reqs (as a premed) at UT?
Hi Guys!

I am an incoming freshman at UT Austin and was wondering how I can space out my pre reqs at UT Austin. I am part of the WINS program and was planning on doing the following:

Freshman year: Gen Chem, Bio

Sophomore year: Orgo and physics

1.) Is this  reasonable spacing?

2.) I have AP credit for psychology and calculus--- should I use them?

3.) When should I take Biochem?

I need advice on wether to take PSY420M during the summer or not, help!
Hello everyone! I am a psychology BS student planning on taking online PSY420M (previously named psy418) during the summer with Lawrence Cormack. I just wonder, has anyone taken it during the summer? And if so, what is the class format? The class starts on June 3, and I have to travel that weekend to attend a wedding and my family wants to travel possibly one week afterwards. Is it possible to succeed (make an A) and travel that first week of class? I do not want to jeopardize my GPA just for one week of travel. Let me know what you think! Thanks

Help me decide!
PLEASE HELP, I'VE GOT TO MAKE A DECISION AND I'VE BEEN STRESSING FOR WEEKS :(

Intended major: Biomedical Engineering at JHU and Neuroscience at UT Austin, premed

Cost: Both are about the same

**JHU**

Pros:

* Cooler major (BME > Neuroscience)
* JHU has cool biomedical research opportunities
* Beautiful campus
* Smaller and more personable
* More flexibility if I want to change majors (but I'm pretty set on medicine, so I don't think that'll be an issue)

Cons:

* Baltimore seems so...mehh
* Everyone comes here to do premed, probably driving up competition
* I heard grade deflation is a thing here. Honestly, the thing I'm most scared of is not doing well, and screwing my chances at med school.

**UT Austin**

Pros:

* Got accepted into natural science honors (will give research opportunities, and community seems to be amazing). This honors program has a 100% acceptance rate into medical school!
* Closer to home
* Grade inflation (compared to what JHU), and I think it'd probably be more chill compared to JHU but idk.
* Austin seems to be better than B'More

Cons:

* The default option -- everyone and their mother goes here, at least from my school
* HUGE. Hard to feel like it's a personal experience.
* Not as highly ranked.
* I keep thinking on what I'd miss out on going to JHU

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

JHU will be better for my future if I can manage to do above average, while UT would probably be better otherwise. How do I get over a fear of the failure?

UT Austin vs. Northwestern?? PLZ HELP!!
Hi everyone! I need to send my deposit today!!! I'm planning on pursuing neuroscience on the pre-med track, and I was wondering if Northwestern or UT Austin would be better for my GPA, finding shadowing/research opportunities, and also a good work-play balance? 

For context, I am in-state for UT Austin, but money isn't really an issue for my family. However, should I pick UT Austin just because it's cheaper? And do any UT Premeds regret going to such a large state school, or do you wish that you went somewhere else?

Any help would be appreciated!!

Tips for an incoming Freshman looking to go Pre-med!
Hey, everybody!

I am very excited to take on the next phase of my educational career at UT Austin. However, I'm extremely nervous about the shift that is about to take place in multiple facets of my life. I would hate to miss out on opportunities that are easy to overlook when you're an overwhelmed first-year college student. I want to make the most of this transition and start off on good foundations.

Do any of y'all have some advice you'd like to share with me (I would especially appreciate academic advice -- mentoring, volunteering, internships, studying, etc.)? Thank you!

Are there any programs for students wanting to travel home for the weekends?
I live in Corpus Christi and I would like to come down to corpus about every 2 weeks. I don't have a car, so I can't drive myself and the people from my city aren't going down after school starts. Is there like a program for students driving to their homes? Like a group? I know of the greyhound bus, but I don't know of any programs UT may have.

What do you think campus life will actually be like in Fall 2021?
Hi everyone,

I was just curious what your predictions are regarding Fall 2021. Although the plan is to return to (something close to) normalcy, what do you think will actually happen? Since there are a lot of vaccine-hesitant people out there, I think the US will still have 10,000+ new cases per day (as we still have had about 60,000 daily cases for the past month). Please feel free to explain your predictions/hopes/fears in the comments!

Questions about housing for incoming grad students
Hi everyone, I’ve been accepted to do a Masters in Structural Engineering at Austin and had a couple of questions regarding accommodations. I really appreciate it if you guys took some time to answer them.

1.	What actually is “North Campus”, “West Campus”, etc.. Are they considered on-campus housing? Or are they areas that have out-of campus housing? Are there dining halls available in these campuses? Because I am seeing several apartments in places like utexas.rent so I am confused whether these come under the university’s housing or separate private ones?

2.	Whats the best area to live for an incoming grad student? I’ve seen discussions about West campus being louder and more active (but having more of a student experience) and North campus having more quitter options. What is the best strategy to find accommodations that is good for grad students while still getting an experience of student life?

3.	 How to find a roommate to share apartments with? How do most incoming grad-students find who to live with? 

Thank you!

CS opportunities outside of the CS major?
I am a first year computer science major and this spring semester was my second and last opportunity to pass the introductory programming course offered at UT. I am so incredibly sad about the fact that I will most likely be kicked out of the major due to not meeting the requirement of passing every entry-level course for advancement (failing CS 312, have not taken the other two entry-level classes), but I do not think that there is anything that I can do about it at this point. I really wish I could have adapted to the online learning environment and that I was a better test taker. This past year has been the worst. Still, I really want to become a programmer and work in the computer science field in the future. Is there any way for me to continue exploring computer science at UT despite not being a computer science major? I appreciate any responses in advance!

Graduate Students: UT is increasing your out of pocket health insurance $$$ Action Sought
UT Grad Students - please read and share - your health insurance cost will increase even with a TA/GRA appointment and it may not be legal. In a nutshell, UT is switching Graduate students from UT Select to Academic Blue and the benefit is taxable according to UT. However, under ACA it’s illegal to tax a health care benefit.  It is, however, ok to tax a lump sum that you then can use to buy whatever health insurance you want, but that is not what UT is proposing. 

There is a desperate need for people to email the board of regents asking them to put health insurance on the agenda for the May 6-7 meeting bor@utsystem.edu - I've included a sample email below this post.

Please see here for a full breakdown of the changes: [https://docs.google.com/.../1euRqJ-10O3XFn9G.../edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1euRqJ-10O3XFn9G-J7iUZdJ4hNCT-DdHG30aZkusD_8/edit?fbclid=IwAR1-hThO8bsdTpP0I5GXA_n70EdqhCd6s2r2qtglK8TV2fb2p9FfZazS_Ks)

PLEASE SHARE with Underpaid at UT what the switch would mean for you: [http://bit.ly/ABConcerns](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FABConcerns%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1hY79WFMwNrrmTEhsNrGfm4Mz9lm83MeV9JCUUqa4ExpqFBGQWvLmnq0c&h=AT1M-wJAidfv7e2d7KBaKV0qyZTddGEbXobrUdk3R2aeRk2kN9sgUF0RDSZvEk2AAa7G5MGE_WXp0TxzpySsrbLtvoDk1agJR_rK9U0WRJGucGhV_BqQkrZQ2LPgWoTYMU9dQw&__tn__=-UK-R&c[0]=AT3y0rJ5j6EMnu4Q22Pd3m_uHXIOt5KJZk8wnUbEFtsG7f6797xvIxHJAvnBim0eFiYiq5G1TIdYre2QneXunQPxOzVsk-b4xhVF50mnBfAuFH9MAMWqNR-gfVG08lcJ4bTi)

&#x200B;

Sample Email:

To Whom it May Concern:

Please add a discussion of the upcoming health insurance changes for graduate students to the May 6-7 meeting. These changes will impact the capacity for many graduate students to afford continuation of graduate studies, in particular those with dependents. Greater transparency about these coming changes will allow students to plan for the 2021-2022 school year in advance.  

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Stat class at UT as a HS senior?
Basically👆. Why would some one take an online stat class at UT as a high school senior?
--------------------------------------------------
Taking a core class at UT or CC over the summer. Both online.
So right now I’m registered to take NTR 306 over the summer at the $500 discount rate. I’m also planning to take SPAN 1411 at ACC which will be around $400.

I’m considering just finishing my last science credit at ACC as it’s a bit cheaper and will likely be easier, but the prices are close enough where I’m fine with taking NTR 306 as I’ve heard it’s a good class. 

What would you do? Also how do you feel about taking two summer classes at the same time.

[OOS Student, Computer Science] I'm planning on becoming an undergraduate research assistant. Will I be able to get a n in-state tuition waiver for this?
Hi,

I'm an incoming freshman in the computer science department, however the out-of-state fees are extremely high. From my understanding, the 2 ways to get in-state tuition are:

1. Getting residency by working(?) or domicile
2. Becoming a research assistant

However, I wasn't sure fi in-state tuition waivers were given to undergraduate research assistants rather than just grad students. 

Also, for what it's worth, I should be given sophomore or even junior status from community college credits (60 semester units/100 quarter units) and AP exam credits (4 - 8 exams)

Thanks!

Is it doable to jump into Number Theory (M328k with Kidwell) without taking Discrete Math (M325k)?

If you're currently stressing or this semester has been rough, just know it's all going to be alright!!
Just a little reminder that your academics do **NOT** define your abilities. You got this!!  I almost died last week, but thankfully I went to the ER before it got worse. I'm a week behind on every class and trying to catch up rn, but I'm now able to reflect on how bad my mental health was before going to the hospital. Good luck to everyone hanging there this semester; it's been a chaotic one :))
--------------------------------------------------
How difficult is it to be social at UT?
I'll be attending UT this fall and will be getting an off-campus apartment. I've never been very social and this will be a new experience for me being away from home. What are the social opportunities like at UT? I'd like to be able to jump into some extracurriculars quickly and get to meet some people, but I'm not sure exactly how easy that's going to be. I'm a mechanical engineering major who enjoys music, technology, and cars so I'm looking into some orgs based around that stuff to hopefully get to know some people.
--------------------------------------------------
How is the general workload at UT?
Ill be attending UT as a freshman this Fall and I was curious what the day to day workload is like? Do you feel like you have the opportunity to do stuff you want to do every now and then or is it work 90% of the time outside of class? I want to take as many opportunities as I can while I'm there (clubs, personal projects etc.) but I'm not exactly sure what to expect as far as time to do these things goes
--------------------------------------------------
Who else is nervous about the transition back to in-person classes?
While I’m not as worried about COVID now that I’ve been vaccinated, I’m definitely gonna miss some of the perks of online learning.

Mandatory attendance policies have always been my enemy, and it’s been so nice to roll out of bed and log on to zoom right before my classes start. Lectures being recorded also made it really easy to go back and catch up on material in your own time. 

And professors have been so lenient with us. Flexible deadlines, majority open note tests, relaxed standards of professionalism, etc. Readjusting to classroom expectations is going to be a challenge.

I’ve never been able to maintain a 15 hour course load in person, but it’s been significantly easier for me to do so online. Maybe I’ve just matured but I’m nervous about attempting 15 hours in the fall.

I guess I just haven’t spent a full semester in person for so long (fall 2018 for me) that I can barely remember what it was like!
--------------------------------------------------
Does taking a class p/f look bad on a transcript?
Hey y’all !

I’m pretty sure I’m going to end up doing rly poorly in one of my classes this semester, and I think that, rather than having my entire gpa dragged down by this one class (my other grades are pretty good) I should just take this one class p/f.

I planned on going to grad school once I graduated, and was wondering how taking a class p/f would look on a transcript or if it may deter universities from accepting me into their program? 

I really don’t want to Q-drop this class because then it’ll mess with my total credit hours that I need to graduate.

Idk how relevant this is but I’m a freshman.

Thanks!

Which Business Minor class should I take along with MIS?
So to fit in all my classes into 4 years I'm going to have to double up on my business classes next semester. I will be taking MIS for sure (I have already done ACC this semester).

About accepting the FAN
Does accepting the FAN as is mean that we would have to pay for the loan amounts that are listed on the FAN too? Or does accepting them just means that you would have the option to take out loans, but it's not required to pay for them just because you accepted them?

Experiences/advice for internal transfer to College of Natural Sciences

I got accepted to UT Austin in January, and my Mid-Year report (which also didn't have Spanish 3 on it) has already been sent to them. Are there any consequences for dropping a course after applying and getting accepted to a college, and what should I do to make sure I don't get rescinded?

How far up a waitlist do you usually need to be to get into a class?
Hey guys. Currently sitting 4th out of 22 people on a waitlist for a class and not sure whether that’s high enough for me to get a spot.

RS 373M (registration help, please)
Hey y’all, I have a question and would love some help. So registration was rough as per usual. I ended up with only a few classes I need and the rest I’m scrambling to get. There’s one I grabbed at whim called Biomedicine, Ethics and Culture. It sounds awesome but...it’s an 8am class and the professor sounds horrible and really tough. Has anyone taken this and is willing to impart some wisdom? 

Or does anyone have any ideas on how to snatch currently full classes? 

Or does anyone know of any good alternative classes to take for either the Ethics and Leadership in Health Care Certificate or electives for a BS Biochem major?

I’ve spoken to my advisor and she said to try and grab an elective or one of the other sociology classes I tried to get, like SOC 308S, but I’m not sure if that’ll be possible. 

I really appreciate your help! :))

Housing: Year leases transitioning to month-to-month leases?
Hello Longhorns, 

I am a grad student that is set to graduate at the end of summer 2022, which I believe would be in the middle of August. I've been a remote student in the West Coast for the past year, and I am super stoked to finally move to Austin, but I'm a bit worried about finding the right lease. 

My current lease ends July 31 2021, but I would like an overlap of a month to move in, so ideally find a lease that starts July 1 2021. I would need to stay there until Sept 1 2022 at least ... I know that there are some places that sign you on for a year-lease and can switch to month-to-month; how hard is it to find those in Austin? I looked at the housing FAQ and it seems like on-campus housing is difficult to find (and now is too late applying for), so I'm directing my efforts at off-campus housing. I am in my late 20's and would prefer to live with other grad students (any kind, don't care what college) or young professionals. I read in some post history that North Campus and Hyde Park are where grad students typically live? The Facebook groups seem to be my best bet, but just wondering if you guys have any advice. 

Hook 'em!

hi everyone! my name is nia and i graduated from ut austin last year, and spent the last year working as a clinical research assistant at mcgovern. i got into several top-tier medical schools this application cycle including stanford, washu, baylor, and texas public schools ( and because i know people will ask - I graduated with honors in bio, my gpa was a 3.7, and I scored a 52x on the MCAT). I was actually considering staying in texas for medical school even though i'm a california transplant (i qualify for that sweet sweet in-state tuition now), but decided to go home to the west coast. i wanted to give back to my fellow premed and prehealth students here since i feel like no one really ever took me aside and showed me how to succeed as a prehealth student except for a few upperclassmen mentors that really took the time to guide me on courses, student organizations, and getting involved in research - stuff like that. it's because of them that i feel like i was lucky enough to get into a top med school.

for that reason, i've compiled a bunch of resources that I used in preparing for the MCAT especially, but also that I felt really helped me learn the concepts in my prereqs in the classes at ut austin (it might be a little specific to certain instructors I had, but they should be generally helpful). i'll compile them and send them in an email later this week for those that are interested, and will provide a link in the comments! also, if anyone has any questions about any aspect of premed/grad school - extracurriculars, conducting research, making school lists and personal statements, studying for tests, clinical experiences, etc., please feel free to ask below :) life is too short to be constantly competing with the people that will one day be your peers and colleagues!

Anyone have experience with a Loft room at Texan & Vintage?
\^Title. My roommate group is looking to sign at Texan & Vintage, but the space we want has a loft. I know the loft only has 3 walls, so I was wondering if anyone had any experience with it and could give tips. It's significantly cheaper than the normal bedroom, so that's a plus but it might not be worth it if people just find that it's a horrible experience. Thank you!!

O-Chem Waitlist - Will I Get Off?
Hi! 

I'm currently 35/125 on Shabbir's OChem waitlist. If you've been in this position, is it likely I will get off? This problem is that without OChem, I'm only registered for 11 hours and I'm struggling to find other classes to add because they all conflict. 

Can anyone give me any advice on what to do? I fucking hate registration

Solution manuals to engineering textbooks
So, I start grad school in the fall and pulled out my old labtop to lookthrough some old college stuff and for the life of me I cant remember the dang password to get into it! 

Mainly, im interested in the solution manuals that I had on there and really dnt want to lose them as it was a great resource to have in my studies. 

So, I was wondering if anyone here had solution manuals to any engineering mechanics textbooks of any kind? Or know how to get into a locked computer without having to delete everything? 

Thanks!

Taking advanced courses in the Butler School of Music as a non-major (Mech E, Cockrell School of Engineering)
Hey guys, recent admit to the Cockrell school here. I've always had a desire to study music at the university level along with engineering, but I want to focus on higher-level theory, music history, microtonality, ethnomusicology, and computer-generated/algorithmic composition (using Csound, Pure Data, etc.). 

Unfortunately, I assume these classes would not be available to non-majors as just electives since the Butler School is very selective with non-majors in terms of what courses are made available to them. Is there any way to prove that I am proficient or capable enough to take these courses as electives without having to double major in the Butler School? Double majoring in these two will probably be very taxing and take time away from my engineering focus. 

I feel I am capable to take these classes as electives based on innate abilities and extensive experience with musical performance, composition, and research.

Please let me know if you guys have any advice!
--------------------------------------------------
Will UT Austin rescind my acceptance?
I plan on attending UT Austin in the fall as a freshman but right now, I currently have a B and may end up with a C in AP Biology if I'm not careful. Is there any chance that UT may rescind me because of this deficient grade? I have 2 A's and 2 B's in my other classes right now. If it makes a difference, I only had A's and B's in my high school years and currently have a 3.84 unweighted.

Questions on whether Honors college is worth it and how hard it would be to maintain a 3.5 GPA
Hello, I am going to UT for the fall semester and I got admitted to the college of engineering majoring in Mechanical engineering and wondered if it was worth it to take honors since I was accepted into it
Is it worth it? Or would the work-load be too much?
Are there clear benefits or is it fairly similar? 
Would it help maintain a higher GPA or hinder it?
And the next question would be considering one of my scholarships where I will need to maintain a 3.5 GPA and wondered how difficult that would be especially considering my major?
Thank you for your time and have a great day

areas on campus to do online class?

AP Exam Question (Incoming ECE student)
Hello everyone!

I'll be an incoming ECE student at UT this fall and with AP exams coming up, I had some questions about some exams I might cancel (we're getting full refunds this year because of COVID) since I feel like I'm not prepared enough + I don't really want to waste time and money studying for something that I won't be able to claim. (Also, I've searched this sub extensively for questions like these and could not find anything pertaining to my personal situation which is why I'm asking).

I'm not sure if AP Macroeconomics or AP Computer Science A will give me any credits towards my core/degree plan. For AP Macro, I'm already planning on claiming a previous AP social science for my behavioral science credit that's required in the core but I also heard engineers need to do engineering econ or something??

Also I feel like AP CSA will be almost completely useless since I'm not in CS and after emailing UT testing services and the engineering advisors, I didn't really get an answer to my question of whether I should even bother taking the exam, so I would appreciate any input from current ECE students!

Thank you so much!

Deciding between UT Austin and Boston U
So I’m currently deciding in between Boston University and UT Austin, and it's a pretty hard decision since both are my top choices. Definitely, both are top schools with great academics, both are ranked top 25 in economics or something like that. My intended major is economics but I’ll like to do a simultaneous major in finance as well.   


Since both are great academically, I think the most important factor that will help me make the decision is the social scene: like what students that stay in dorms do during the weekends and how is the social scene in general for international students. My main concern is that I’ll be bored (I know that it is up to me and I’ll try my best to socialize and everything). I’ve heard that UT students main attraction is the longhorn’s football games and the after parties.   


What I wanted to ask is the following:  
What do UT students do in their social life?  
What are some fun places that UT students usually go to in the city of Austin?  
Is it really competitive to get into the simultaneous major in finance?  
What is your advice for my decision?  


Thanks everyone!

Thoughts on not wearing a mask on/near campus when fully vaccinated
I got my second Pfizer dose a little over two weeks ago, and with the [CDC's updated guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html), it sounds like it would be safe for me and others around me for me to not wear a mask when outdoors in non-crowded areas.

The only thing really stopping me at this point is my neurotic ass being afraid of being seen as a maskhole. I will still continue to wear masks indoors and if I ever find myself in a crowded situation outside (not sure if I'm gonna see that for a while) for the time being until further restrictions are lifted. UT's current density on campus doesn't seem too bad, not enough for it to count as a crowded area such as a sporting event or concert that the CDC refers to in their updated guidelines.

What will y'all plan on doing when you get fully vaccinated, or if you are fully vaccinated, are you changing your mask wearing with the CDC's updated guidelines?
--------------------------------------------------
MUS303 Fundamentals of Music for non-music major
I’m an engineering major, and I play the guitar as a hobby (beginner). I’ve never taken a music course in my life, and I always wanted to play the guitar “more professionally”. I will take it as my VP core requirement for the fall but I’m afraid that it is only theoretical stuff and they don’t actually teach you how to practice/play. I couldn’t find the syllabus so if someone could provide more info I will be thankful. Is it enjoyable? Is it good for beginners? How is the grading?
--------------------------------------------------

Internal Transfer into Moody: Optional Essay
I’m applying for the ADV Major in the Communications school, from a UGS major, and I had heard from my advisor and some others that the optional essay is just to explain things like lower-than-average academics, or to explain a Covid pass/fail, so I planned not to do it. However upon actually going to submit the application, i see that all the application is is my email, my past major, and the optional essay slot. Now i’m second guessing if i should leave it blank since it appears to be like the whole application. Has anyone here done the internal transfer to Moody? and should I write the essay, or leave it off??
--------------------------------------------------
At what point should I go ahead and sign up for off campus housing??
Hey!!
So I was completely unaware of the housing situation at UT for a hot minute and didn’t submit my housing application until 4/21 😬 I’ve since then done some research and me and my parents are looking for off campus options in case I don’t get a dorm on campus. When would be an appropriate time to assume that I won’t be getting on campus housing and should sign up for off campus housing? Do housing contracts only come out until a certain date? Do I even have a chance of getting a dorm this late? 
I’m an incoming freshman btw if that changes anything 
Thank you so much!!

I signed up for this class with Holleran because I heard it was easy and interesting. However, I didn't notice she was teaching with someone else named Kasey Claborn.

ECE Sophomore Class Advice
Next semester I'm planning on taking M340L, EE313, and EE312. I was originally going to take history along with that, but I've been thinking about taking it over summer instead. If I do that, are there any ECE courses that I could take without overwhelming myself? I know it's only 12 hours but it's my first semester on campus. I already have the non-ECE requirements like physics, a VAPA, UGS, and English. 

I was thinking about taking EE351K, EE316, or M325K (since I plan on the computer track) but I'm not sure if 4 math/ece classes will be too much. The workload in EE319k/EE411/M427J is pretty heavy for me right now and I'm glad I have my VAPA to ease that.

I'll give a silver to anyone who can help lol, I'm kind of desperate to figure out my schedule and I'd be very grateful. Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------
Is it too late to get a dorm contract at all?
Hi, I’m a incoming freshman and so I didn’t think I was going to end up going to UT until very recently. So, I ended up submitting my $50 housing contract just 5 days ago. 

However, my friend put me as her roommate and I intend to do the same thing on the app... will this increase our chance of rooming together and me getting a contract?

If not, does this mean I will not get a contract at all?

UGS as a sophomore or over the summer
I was unable to take a UGS as a freshman bc of a schedule/time issue, but my advisor just told me to take it in the fall as a sophomore.

Should I just take it over the summer (like a 302, which I think also counts for the credit) or just hope to get a decent class this fall?

When will UT release the instructors names for courses that don't have them listed?
I want to take some classes that have some one well rated professor, and many others that aren't well rated...
And for some of the classes, UT haven't listed the instructors names yet. 

This class is a requirement for my degree and a pre-requisite for some upper div classes I'm hoping to take next semester, so I'm concerned.

I wanna get it over with, but I'd rather take it with a professor that has good reviews than one that is rated more roughly...

Any insights? 
Is there any way to know when they'll release the instructors name? 

Thank you!

Jump attempt on top of Dobie Garage prevented
Hey y’all, so I just watched this whole thing unfold. Never seen anything like it but I am glad it was prevented. I don’t want to speak for the person of course, but always keep mental health not only for you, but for your peers and friends in the forefront of your mind. Maybe this leads to even more of a focus on mental health for the campus. I’m just a freshman so I’ve only experienced online classes in the COVID year (not sure if there is usually mental health help). Just check up on your friends and classmates, you never know what they could be experiencing.

GOV prerequisite for fall completed over the summer
I am trying to take a GOV course that has a 6 hour lower-division GOV prerequisite. I have already claimed credit for GOV 310 and am going to take 312L over the summer to get the 6 hours.

Is this true?

Which of these SB courses will be best to pair with a really time-consuming CS class this summer?
Ok, so I'm taking CS 313E this summer (whole session) and it has a huge workload. I'm also registered for 1st-session Jazz Appreciation (MUS 307) and want to take another class that fills two requirements (SB core and pre-health certificate).

The problem is that there's only one 2nd-session class that fits my requirements and the professor is brand new, so I have no idea what the workload will be like. (SOC 307k/ WGS 301 - Fertility and Reproduction with Vrinda Marwah)

I know Jazz Appreciation is known for being easy but I want to be cautious about adding a third class to my 1st-session workload. These are my 1st session options. Does anyone have any thoughts on them or the professors? 

>HDF 304 Family Relationships with Heather Quimby (1st session)  
>  
>SOC 302 Intro to Study of Society with Ruijie Peng (also brand new, can't find any info on this lecturer) (1st session)

>SOC 308S/ HS 301 INTRO TO HEALTH & SOCIETY with Nina Palmo (First session)

 What's my best option for a balanced, manageable workload this summer? Should I take a third class for the 1st session (and which one)?  Or should I risk the unknown and take SOC 307k so that I only take two classes at a time?

Time zone accommodations-Summer 2021
My lease does not last throughout the summer list most peoples do, so I will be going to stay with family in a different time zone. I registered for an online class this summer thinking accommodations were pretty much a given. The class would be 5:00-6:30 AM in the time zone I’ll be in. I emailed the professor and they said they could not accommodate me. Is there a more formal way to request accommodations or am I SOL?

Easy Upper Division courses??
I need 5 upper division hours in any subject in order to graduate. I honestly just want to get them over with and am looking for easy classes to take over the summer. I have taken human sexuality and am taking another EDP (mindfulness and something), but does anyone have suggestions for other easy upper division hours? It’s such a broad requirement I have no idea where to start.

Can’t register for classes due to financial aid not intact yet
I’m a transfer out of state and since the beginning of this semester I have had submitted so many documents and calls to get my financial aid in, to this day it hasn’t come in yet. I applied for tuition loan because the office said that’s the only way I was able to register for spring 2021. Now I can’t register for classes for fall 2021 till my financial comes in which they said is most likely July and I actually cried

I don’t know what to do now. Even if my financial comes in I know by July all good teachers and the classes I actually need will be unavailable 

I will apply for scholarships and whatnot but I’m so lost and tired. I’ve been up since six looking for classes to take only to be told later on I have to wait

Microbio says open but it's restricted?

Is this ECE schedule doable for next fall?
This will likely be my fall semester of sophomore year:

- EE411
- EE422C (currently in EE312H, plan on doing software or datasci track)
- M340L
- Some English class for Creative Writing Certification

My main questions are: how difficult does this schedule seem? Should I swap out 422C for Discrete Math (M325K), or could I possibly take both? Or would it be better to take M325K in fall and EE422C in spring?

Thank you :)

UT Austin or Rice for CS? - Please help me decide!
Hello everyone!

I have spent the last 4 weeks researching each school, but I still have no idea which one to choose.

Comparing each school's CS programs, Rice's is worse than UT's but not by *too* much (T20-ish vs T10). However, UT has a greater selection of CS courses, clubs, and opportunities as a whole, especially because it is a larger school and located in Austin. I shouldn't have any issues with internships at Rice, but I think I'd have a higher ceiling as a UT student/grad. 

I'd definitely be happy with the social scene and location at both schools, but I prefer UT and Austin as a whole. With all that being said, you're probably thinking the obvious choice is UT, but there's one issue: I'd have to internal transfer into CS from UGS undeclared. However, I'm just as hesitant to go to Rice because it is $25k more expensive per year and I would have to take out $10-15k+ in loans per year. 

I know the internal transfer process for UTCS is **extremely** competitive, but I'm willing to GRIND and do whatever is necessary to transfer into CS (attend office hours, info sessions, take advantage of the Sanger Learning Center, etc). The acceptance rate is \~40-50%, and there are no guarantees, but I believe I'd have a solid chance if I really take advantage of all my resources. My backup plan if I can't get into UTCS is to either major in Math with an Elements of Computing certificate or just transfer to UTD/A&M. Of course, I don't plan on transferring to UTD/A&M, but I'd be okay with it if I was forced to.

**TLDR: UT is hands down the better and much cheaper option, but I'm not guaranteed a CS major. Rice's CS program is not too far off, but I would have to go into debt to afford it.**

**Should I take the risk, go to UT, and try to internal transfer into CS ($29k/year), or should I just play it safe and study CS at Rice ($54k/year)? Are there any other options I could consider?**

Thank you for the help!

Best Department to get a writing flag?
I want to fulfill a writing flag during the summer, any suggestion for best class?
--------------------------------------------------
12 hours too little
Currently set to only have 12 hours this coming semester (sophomore) I want to do more as I feel like doing so few will set me behind, however All 3 of the courses that make up those 12 hours have a lab, meaning 11 hours of lab total this semester (PHY 105M, GEO 416K, and GEO 416M). My counselor said that might be a little much but you could try. 

My question to y’all is, do y’all think I should try squeezing in another course like my VAPA this semester to get more hours? Currently  the most I’ve taken any semester is 15 hours and that’s about what I’m comfortable with, not sure how much time lab courses take.

Advice on COLA Language Sequence?
Hi everyone,

I’m currently deciding what language to study for my foreign language requirement and would like some advice. Here’s my current thoughts on the languages I’m considering:

Spanish

Pros: I have a decent background in Spanish, I studied it in HS and grew up around Spanish speakers. Spanish is a very useful language to know, especially in Texas. The sequence is only 3 semesters and 15 hours long. Relatively large department, fitting the classes into my schedule shouldn’t be too difficult.

Cons: I’m not particularly excited by studying Spanish since I already have some background in it.

Korean

Pros: Excited about starting fresh with a new language/culture, learned a small amount from a friend and enjoyed it. Also a useful language to know, but not spoken as widely as Spanish.

Cons: The sequence is 4 semesters and 18 hours long. Smaller department, will be more difficult to fit into my schedule. Potentially more difficult grade-wise due to no prior knowledge. 

Czech

Pros: Always wanted to learn due to my Czech heritage. 

Cons: 4 semester/18 hour sequence, small department again. Potentially difficult as well, and probably the least “useful” language out of the 3. 

Grades are pretty important to me and I typically do well in my courses. Would it require significantly more time and effort to be successful in a brand new language compared to continuing with Spanish? Additionally, does the utility of Spanish greatly outweigh the other two languages? The extra class required for Korean and Czech is noted, but is definitely not a deal breaker. 

Right now it seems like it comes down to whether the extra class, added difficulty, and scheduling difficulty are worth it. I understand that at the end of the day it’s up to me to decide what I want to do, but I would love to hear any of your thoughts! Thank you so much for reading this as well as any help you’re able to provide!
--------------------------------------------------
How is BIO 446L online?
I may take bio 446l in the summer. I was wondering if it is ran pretty well as an online class? Also, would taking this class in the summer just add to the difficulty of the class (never done a summer class so I wouldn’t know). I’ve heard professor Babler is great, but I’ve also heard the lab is awful.
--------------------------------------------------
If enough people are waitlisted could a new section pop up?
As expected, CS 313E for the summer is waitlisted. For anyone that has experienced being low on the list, what placement were you and were you able to get in? Also, has anyone seen a course add a new section for the semester due to a large amount of people wanting to take the course?

Urgent: Has anyone been able to register this semester with an advising bar for Natural Sciences
I have to get a new advisor because my current advisor is graduating, but I currently still have the advising bar. The new advisor has not responded to my countless emails and her only zoom appointments are for after registration. I tried asking the other general advisors, but they are no help because they keep telling me to go and email my new advisor who isn't responding. My registration is tomorrow and I already did my advising worksheet a while ago which should've been processed, but since my advisor left it's just been left there for the new advisor to take care of. Please let me know if you know of anything to do or if anyone has been able to register for CNS registration even with an advising bar.

McCombs Transfer Process Question
Hey y’all, I’m an incoming freshman and kind of lost with class registration coming up soon. I was admitted off a rejection appealI to undeclared liberal arts but McCombs business management was always the plan. I have a few questions.

1. I’ve heard that you are eligible to apply to transfer after one semester of freshman year, given you earn an excellent gpa for that semester. Is that true?

2. Are there required pre req classes I must register for during registration or will COLA have me take basic undergrad classes? If so, what’s the best way to pick classes?

3. If I’m interested in an entrepreneurship minor, will I have to consider pre req classes for freshman year or worry about that later. Assuming I transfer into McCombs after 1st semester.

Any sort of insight would be greatly appreciated. Hook ‘em

Not so affluent intl' student looking to matriculate in UT Austin
Dear all, I am posting in this subreddit to enquire about a few things that could potentially help me save some dollars if I get into UT Austin (CNS).

Some background about myself:

* Due to mandatory conscription laws, I am to serve in the army of my country for 2 years. This nets me a ton of free time.
* I will mostly be the one paying for my own education in UT Austin and can thus be more penny-pinching than I would like to admit.

Questions:

* Are there any (hopefully cheap) 100% online community colleges that will accept intl' students and allow for credits to be transferred to UT Austin (CNS)? Aside from leveraging on the spare time I have (2 years), my understanding is that it will allow me to skip some modules and thus save up on some tuition fees.
* Are there any jobs for students? My understanding is that the campus offers jobs to students but it is not publicized.

Will add in more questions if they come to mind.

Is It Possible To Get Psychology Lab Experience Despite Graduating This Spring with an Unnoficial Psych Degree?
I should've planned better but it is what it is. I'm graduating with a degree in anthropology and an unofficial psychology degree. It is unofficial because despite being qualified grades/resume wise the department bluntly told me it is reserved for underclassmen and people without majors... So not me. I decided that I really liked psychology late but now realized that without lab experience a future in a psych-related field will become slimmer and slimmer despite getting 24 hours of psych credits and a stats course so I am literally no different than a UT psych student, I got good grades and have shown interest despite realizing things a little late.

Internal Transfer Advice (Engineering)
Hey y’all! I’m a recent admit for the Co2025. Although I was admitted via top 6% I was denied from my major choices (both engineering’s.) For those who have/ attempted internal transfer, what are your thoughts on the process? If this helps for context, I have already taken math through Cal BC (AB 5, BC tbd) and could retake for gpa inflation if necessary. Regarding engineering, I would likely attempt transfer into mechanical. I know this situation is not ideal but my Rice finaid appeal looks unlikely and my other smaller schools haven’t administered many scholarships (UT may be best value). Any help is greatly appreciated!

Is it worth it to major in RTF if I care about job prospects?
So I’ve been passionate about story telling and film since before I can remember. However, I’ve now woken up to reality that it’ll be much harder for a film major to get a well-paying job at least right upon graduation and possibly long after. I know UT has a good film program so does the RTF program at UT have better job prospects for their seniors or should one go to grad school once they graduate? Or should I just work my ass off and get as many internships as I can while a student?

Or should I choose a different major?

Best Prof for Summer History??
Trying to fulfill Pt. 2 of my core req (HIS 315L). Has anyone taken a history class w/Ashley Garcia? Was she any good? (I’ve heard good things about Steven Mintz, but he’s not teaching during the summer.) Jeremi Suri’s class sounds like a lot of busy work according to RMP. Any suggestions are welcome!

ME 210 for non-engineering major
I'm a CS major but am looking for nonmajor classes to fill my course schedule. I have an interest in design and was wondering if 1. there's precedent for non-engineering students to take ME 210 and 2. if I would enjoy the class (the idea of learning CAD and making something using the MakerSpace sounds rad!) or if it's not a class engineering students typically enjoy. Would be particularly helpful if anyone knew anything about the new prof, Rylander. Thanks!

Likeliness of testing out of government if you fail the AP exam?
I’ve looked through some posts on here & it seems like the exam to test out of GOV 310L is notoriously easy. However I assume most the people asking & responding to those posts probably got at least a 3 on the AP test & im not super confident I will. It has nothing to do with the material, I did well in the class. But I’m really struggling in economics & trying to go relearn & study gov on my own while desperately trying to understand & pass economics is really making things difficult & I’m not sure I can do both. & I can’t afford to slack in economics bc although I don’t need the AP credit I’m really close to failing & not graduating, so of the 2 government will have to take the hit even though I actually need it.

Anyways I say all this because for the ut exam I think I can do well since I’ll have time to study for it without worrying about anything else. But I’m not sure if it’s harder to get the credit if you didn’t get a 3 or higher. I think there’s an exam that’s not supplemental to your AP score so I guess I’d have to take that one, but most the other tests like it for other subjects seem to be pretty hard. Is it just as easy as the supplemental exam or will it also be more difficult? Depending what happens I might think about taking the U.S. history (1st half) one as well so I’m curious that too. Thanks in advance

Nine Week Summer Session Hour Limit
I remember reading that for summer sessions you’re not allowed to take over 14 hours for the entire session or over 8 hours for a six week session. I was wondering how the nine week session affected this limitation

For example, I want to take a 4 hour whole session, a 3 hour nine week class, and a 3 hour 2nd term class. Would the system let me register for these?
--------------------------------------------------
For the civil engineering degree program can you take the science elective at a different university for credit?
I know you can take the physics and chemistry credits outside of UT and transfer them in, can you take a compatible science elective (IE biology) and transfer it in as credit towards the degree?

Do classes listed under multiple numbers fulfill the same requirements?
I need to take as course to fulfill a requirement for my major by taking an upper-level EUS course, but the EUS course is full. The class is also listed as an HIS class, even though it's the same class, and that listing was available. Even though I'm taking the class as an HIS class, would it still fulfill my requirement of taking an upper-level EUS course since it is also listed as such, even though that's not the listing I signed up for?

For anyone in the MPA (Master in Professional Accounting) program, how are the professors?
I'm coming in as a tMPA this fall and am just casually waiting for my academic advising session for the moment. I've been trying to read up on the professors listed on the McCombs website [here](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/~/media/Files/MSB/Program%20MPA/facultyspotlight.pdf), but I haven't been able to really get a good idea about how they teach, if they're helpful with difficult circumstances, etc.

Also, I'm looking for any useful tips or other such things about the MPA program, if you have them. Any will do.

Thank you!

Are there any adult autism diagnosis resources at UT?
 I believe I am autistic but I don't want to rely on my own diagnosis for it. I have been trying to find diagnostic services externally with little to no luck and was wondering if UT had any resources or if you guys were aware of any external resources? I understand there's no definitive test for Autism so any psychiatrist/psychologist referrals would be great too! Thanks

Will McCombs accept my Calculus II online summer class?
They accept your credits if you take it online, right? I'll be taking it at Lone Star College by the way. 

My Calc I credit will most likely come from the AP test I take in a few weeks, so it should all work out.

Is there any hope for me..?
I'll try to keep this brief.

I am a senior getting ready to graduate this year. But, I'm in the middle of finishing my core classes, and I don't think I'm gonna pass all of them.

I don't want to get into details, but I'm under extreme circumstances. This is mainly because I started working a job late 2020, and now my family has become dependent on me for a good amount of financial support; I've made a drastic shift from student to a working man, and people like my dad are out of a job and is currently in declining health (he's in his mid-70s).

As a result, school has not been my biggest priority these days. I used to be a good student and aimed to make good grades; professors within the College of Fine Arts have acknowledged that I am a hard worker. However, circumstances have changed, and I can hardly call myself a student anymore.

My question is: If I petition this, can the College of Fine Arts (my department) still let me graduate even if I don't pass my two science cores? I'm currently in those two science classes, but there's no hope for me passing at this point...

My counselor has mentioned the idea of petitioning so that one can still "get credit" for the class without taking it, as long as the petition is convincing. I also knew a kid who managed to get an "F" on his transcript removed because he made a petition to the Dean of Fine Arts.

I never thought I'd ever reach this point....but here I am.

Do early orientation dates open up later on?
hi! 

I just signed up for orientation and the only dates available were mid & late July. I didn't realize that the June dates would fill up so soon! Is there generally more availability for the June dates later this month or in May? And does it hurt me to have my orientation in mid July because I know after orientation we're supposed to sign up for classes.

CS 313E for non CS major

ECE - Software '22 : What classes to take?
I did not manage to meet with my advisor soo, figured I'd try to get help here. I'm a junior right now, starting my 4th year in the fall. ECE student doing Software Engineering tech core. 

Right now I'm taking EE 422C, EE 333T, M325K, and my UGS (lol). But I don't know what classes I need to take. For fall I'm considering EE 360 (Algorithms), EE 461L (Software Des&Lab), and maybe M427L (Vector Calc). I'll find some random class later for my free elective. Essentially my question is does anyone know what classes I **should** take? Perhaps instead of one listed above? I can't find any sort of plan for SWE that specifies what classes to take, and quarantine has ruined my ability to make meetings with advisors :\^)

Over summer I'm taking some random classes I still need : Jazz Appreciation, Sociology, and HIS315G I think. But I don't think this should be a problem for determining my Fall semester classes.

Hook 'em!

Registration for physics sequence requirement
Do physics sequences have to be taken in immediate succesion (semester wise)? For example, I'm taking PHY302K/lab currently in Spring 2021. Could I take PHY302L/lab during Spring 2022 and take a break from physics this fall, or is there a requirement somewhere stating that I have to take it immediately next in Fall 2021? 

If it's not a requirement, is it a bad idea to take a semester off of physics in between? Thanks for the help!

I’m planning to take Bio 325, E 316M, Ch204 and Psy 301... Does it Seem Manageable?

I have clarifying questions regarding the WINS/FRI program
Hi! I was recently admitted into the WINS/FRI program and had a few questions!

1.) Is WINS for first year students only? Or does it span over 4 years?

2.) Do WINS students get guaranteed science classes past the first year?

3.) Does being a WINS student guarantee that I get my first choice stream in FRI? or just any stream?

4.) I saw that WINS students get "academic and advising support." How is this different from the advising non-WINS students get? Do we get a totally different advisor?

5.) Do I need to live on Kinsolving after freshman year? 

Thank you so much!

University engagement in online courses

What experience is needed for music 201 courses? How is Longhorn band?
Specifically clarinet... the course says you only need to be able to read music and is unrestricted, but should you be very familiar with the instrument? Practice a lot over the summer? I haven't played for a good few years.

Going off of that, how competitive is Longhorn band? For clarinet, or anyone in general! Is technicality or tone the best bet to focus on for auditions? I have old kinda technical-ish pieces. Is this realistic if I'm just picking it up again?

Thank you for any insights!

Best/ easiest classes to take for a GPA boost?
My first semester was pretty rough so my GPA is sorta low right now. I want to apply to a program next semester and it’s ideal I gain around .3 -.4 for my GPA. I’m pre-health so I’m taking genetics, organic chem, calculus, etc. next semester so I need some easy classes so I won’t have a super difficult workload. What are some classes I can take in the summer or during Maymester that will not require much time that will boost my GPA? Including science classes and some of the GOV/ HIS core courses as well. Feel free to leave easy professor recommendations too and I will look into them. Thanks in advance!

How hard is it to get A's in Econ classes?
I'm a freshman at UT wanting to go to law school. STEM recked my GPA my first semester, so I'm transferring out to get a better GPA. I was wondering how hard the Economics classes here are, and how hard it is to get A's. I saw on some of the syllabi that there are weird grade distributions, where your grade is determined how far you are above the class average so I'm kinda sketched out.

Third time taking EE302
I mean I'm just asking if I should take it a third time. Fall 2020 I "tried" (not really) but just ended up withdrawing all classes so I could try again this semester. I'm gonna end up using the COVID P/F option to get the credit this time around so as to not bomb my GPA so early. 

It's as if the teachers could care less about the material they're teaching. I'm at fault as well since these online classes really don't seem to mesh with me.

I've done enough to scrape by and pass but should I consider taking it again this fall since it's such an integral part of understanding EE?

University of Texas or Notre Dame - Help me choose!
I have been accepted to both UT at Austin and Notre Dame in Indiana - and I'm having trouble deciding which one.  UT has always been my dream school, but Notre Dame is offering me more money (and getting accepted there has impressed more people than getting accepted at UT), so that's tempting.  I'm interested in majoring in animation/graphic arts with an emphasis in storytelling/TV/movies - possibly combined with a computer science degree (maybe).  I initially heard about the AET program and thought it sounded like a good fit for my interests - but I've heard that the program is shifting more to game development rather than animation.  I'd appreciate in anything current UT students can tell me - especially about my field - that might help me make up my mind.

In a similar note, if anyone knows anything about job prospects after graduation (in animation), I'd love to hear about it.

Taking SDS 379R course (First Session) during the Summer while doing internship
Hey y'all,

For the people who have done the Scientific Computation or Applied Statistical Modeling certificates, this class is the final boss for me to get both certificates before I graduate in the spring. I found out that this independent research class is being offered online over the summer during the first session.

What are the opinions of taking this class while doing an internship? This will pretty much be the only summer class I'll be doing. Will it be a lot of work, or should I just wait to do this course in the fall?

Thanks!!

Moving furniture from home to off campus housing

Curious about the marching band!
I’m currently a freshman. I haven’t picked up my flute in a year, but when I was in high school, I was a competitive player. I was a top chair and made the All-State band. But I’m very curious about the longhorn band. It looks really fun! I enjoyed marching in high school. How competitive is the flute section? I assume it’s hard because it’s always been that way, lol. But I guess what’s kept me away from it is that I won’t enjoy the games like how the people in the student section do. Did anyone have problems with that? Also, I haven’t made any friends, is the band a good way of making some? Thank you!

Is this too many hours for an engineering exchange?
I am hopefully going to be doing an exchange next year in electrical and computer engineering at ut austin.

I have to take the same modules in Austin as I do at my home university. The ones I’ve picked out add up to about:
16 semester hours in fall.
17 in spring . 
(I just added up the first digit of each course number)

I just have to pass the modules as my home university counts it as a GPA neutral, so pass-fail, year. Will this be super hard or okay ?

Edit:
I’m going into third year.
The courses are (at the moment at least):
Fall

M 427L Advanced Calculus for Applications II    

EE 325   Electromagnetic Engineering      

EE 351M  Digital Signal Processing           

EE 338L   Analog Integrated Circuit Design            

EE 316   Digital logic design           

 

Spring

EE 422C  Software Design &amp; Implementation II   

EE 411   Circuit Theory   

EE 313   Linear Systems &amp; Signals              

ME 318M  Programming and Engineering Computational Methods           

EE 360K Introduction to Digital Communications

Is it difficult to register for CS courses as a CS major?
I've seen it a millions times that registering for CS courses can be a pain and difficulty for CS majors itself. Im an incoming freshman and worried if getting courses will be tough as an upperclassmen. Can someone explain what they mean when they say its difficult to get courses? Like are there not enough slots, or too big of waiting lists, or not enough professors?

And if you just can't get a course, then what? Can you never take that course or ever learn that CS subject at UT even if you try for ever semester?

How to find projected demand/growth for engineers with certain concentrations/majors
So I am looking for a way to be able to find what sort of jobs I would be qualified for if I obtained a masters in mechanical engineering with a concentration in thermal/fluid systems?

Is there a website for something like this? In my undergrad I made the mistake of not doing the proper research before choosing my major.. petroleum engineering. I want to find out what sort of careers will be available to me with this masters degree. Can anyone help? 

Thermal/fluids systems deals with thermodynamics, fluid mechanics and heat transfer. My family lives north of houston and want to find employment in the area. Unlike the petroleum industry, I want a stable and high projected growth/demand. What does a thermal engineer do? Fluid engineer? Off the top of my head i think of engines and hydraulics and all that jazz. I just need a way to research projected demands and growth for these types of engineers. 

Thanks!

How do you benefit from UT’s alumni network?

UT vs Georgia Tech for EE?
Hey all! I was admitted to both schools for an undergrad in electrical engineering but I'm not sure which school to attend. I'd be paying similar out-of-state tuition for both. Here's a breakdown of the details that I've got for both schools:

**Georgia Tech:**

* Stronger ECE program
* Larger coop program
* Possibly larger study abroad program?
* More flexible in terms of switching majors
* Better reputation for tech and engineering
* Education is argued to be tougher or more rigorous
* Located in Atlanta which has many opportunities but fewer tech ones than Austin
   * Slightly more dangerous than Austin
   * Hot sometimes
* Less social due to its focus on engineering
* \~75% job placement rate for EE
* \~300 student orgs

**UT Austin:**

* Stronger school spirit/pride
* Notable engineering program but perhaps not as strong as GT
* A more rounded university (strong outside of engineering too)
* Large internship/coop program
* Large study abroad program
* Located in Austin, a booming tech hub
   * Better alumni connections within the city
   * Very hot sometimes
* Stronger school sports
* \~99% job placement rate for EE
* Difficult at times to register for some courses (not sure about GT)
* \~1100 student orgs

**For me, it really boils down to the fact that GT offers a more rigorous education while UT offers a better location (professionally and socially). What do you all think?**

**TLDR: Should I attend GT or UT for my undergrad in EE and why?**
--------------------------------------------------
Which professor should I take for Genetics (summer session)?
Only 4 choices: Sung, Lloyd, Fischer, Huq

Please respond if you have taken any of their classes (esp. online). How's the class structure like? Who is relatively easier if I aim for an A? Thanks!

Edit: I really want to hear some reviews on Huq because I am leaning toward his class since he is the only professor for the summer's second session. If someone has taken his class before or has heard anything about him, please give some advice!

Does UT Austin allow gap year deferrals?
I was admitted to the class of '25. Does UT offer enrollment deferrals? And if so, what's the process and approval rate? (i.e. does anyone NOT get approved??) When I search it up, I keep finding results for deferred admission, not deferred enrollment.

thank you so much

Can I get a tuition waiver if I worked on campus?
Hi! I am an OOS incoming freshman and I saw that UT waive student's OOS tuition if they earn 1000 bucks or more. However, I don't know what kind of job qualify for that. If I work for the housing department will I still get my tuition waived. Or that's just for TA and research assistants.

Math Majors what kind of jobs/careers are you in rn, and how do you get there?
Hi, I am currently a math major about to enter senior year in the fall.

I kinda want to enter graduate school in statistics for data science/statistics jobs, but I am bit worried that I may not like graduate school and leave to find job. 

I notice math majors can be little "broad", so they may have different sort of careers/jobs.

So i am wondering what jobs/careers are you doing, and what does it take to get there?

Thank you!

Activities on UT Austin campus during pre-pandemic times

Math Major - what course do I start with that's not a weeder course
Hi I am enrolled into Math major for Fall 2021. I have a question about which course to take first.

I am giving AP Calc BC exam this year which I am sure I will get a 4 or 5. I have heard that college calculus is much harder than high school. I was thinking if I should skip taking the BC Calc credit and take the M408C or any beginner calculus class in the 1st semester. My fear is that what if it's a weeder or weed out class and is unusually difficult.  Any recommendations on where to begin?

3. Did you feel the certificate was worth it? I've heard the classes are fun and great but you come out not being able to fully communicate on a decent level.

Question About BIO 325 With Dr. Fischer (Summer Whole Session)
Hello all,

&#x200B;

I just wanted to ask what Genetics with Dr. Fischer is like. I have looked at many of the RMP reviews, reviewed her syllabi, and asked around; however, I heard she changed things during the Sp2021 semester, and wanted to get an idea of what it looks like now (as compared to past semesters). More specifically, what are the difficulty levels of her quizzes/exams, what is the best way to prepare for her quizzes/exams, and what kind of time commitment does the class entail? Any and all input would be greatly appreciated!

&#x200B;

Thank you in advance.

Course Registration Senior Standing for FIN 370 with William Way
So if I currently have a junior standing currently and the class requires a senior standing as well as credit for FIN 367, would I be able to register for the course if I first put fin 367 for my summer classes and take enough summer classes to put me over the top to become senior standing, or how does that work could someone let me know. I also have credits I need to transfer from community college and I don't know if they will transfer in time for my registration period because the class is supposedly supposed to fill up fast.

Programming Related Courses with No Experience? SDS 348?
I was hoping to hear from people who have taken courses that involve Python and/or R and had never done anything related to that before. Specifically, I am looking at SDS 322E (but this is a new course so no help in hearing from others there). It is, however, replacing SDS 348 and I'm sure there are other courses that say "R experience preferred but not required". I am just wondering if the coursework for these types of courses feels much higher if you're new to coding.

Thoughts on San Jac
Hi! I've seen a lot of posts about which dorm to pick and I honestly want to avoid working rn so I figured I'd share my thoughts on San Jac!

&#x200B;

**Pros:**

\- Having Cypress Bend so close was really nice! I'm vegetarian and J2 doesn't have a lot of vegetarian variety so I usually went to Cypress to get meals (same vegetarian variety as J2, just better quality)

\- The room is fairly big tbh. I didn't have a roommate bc of covid and never felt like I was out of space

\- The bathroom being attached is super convenient! I'm a little lazy (also part of the reason I enjoyed having Cypress nearby) so the convenience of having it so close was nice! Ik you have to clean it on your own, which some people don't like, but I actually prefer to clean my own spaces so that was fine w me!

&#x200B;

**Cons:**

\- While I made friends in the building, a lot of the people here are athletes, so it felt like they already had a friend group with the people they play sports with. I definitely think staying somewhere like Jester would've been better for my social life.

\- Idk if it was worth the price tbh, but I might just feel that way bc there were less activities and such due to covid

\- I pass a lot of people not wearing masks (or wearing them incorrectly) but that kinda seems like the norm on campus atm

\- Not a super big complaint but it's at the bottom of a hill on 21st street, so anytime I went somewhere one campus I had to walk uphill (which was kinda a convenient exercise tbh)

\- There is a thermostat, but it's quite iffy in my opinion. In the fall, I felt like changing the temp never did anything, and in the spring it took a while for it to change (for example I had turned it up a few days ago bc I was cold and it just got warmer today)

&#x200B;

**Which part of San Jac should you live in?**

\- I lived in the North Tower but I've heard my friends in the South Tower complain about it smelling like some not great stuff...

\- Also heard that people with rooms facing Clark Field had the bright floodlights from the field come into their rooms at night, which is annoying

\- My room faces the stadium, which is under construction, so it was a little annoying at times (but I think they're expected to finish by fall). Also, game days were loud enough for me to notice from my room but not enough to bug me (and I kinda enjoyed the vibe)

\- Cypress is under North Tower and the laundry room is under South Tower, but it takes like a minute tops to walk from one tower to the other. I do admit I felt embarrassed for no reason carrying my laundry from North to South Tower but that's probably just me

&#x200B;

That's all I have I think!

UT Austin vs UT Dallas
(Im posting in both reddits to get perspective)

I recently got admitted to UT austin for unintended major (BS in Informatics) after I appealed getting capped for CS. And I was also accepted to ut dallas for comp sci. I am pretty set on comp sci and so if I went to UT my absolute priority would be exceptional grades, and trying to internal transfer to CS. From what Ive seen, im am severely uninterested in Informatics. I was wondering what yall would do in my situation. UT is my dream school on all levels, but I am also very attached to computer science. 

Is this reasonable?
Have you done internal transfer?
Where would you go given the options?

I have tons of questions but cant fit it all in here haha, but if you have a similar experience or advice I would love to hear, and/or DM me. (Cost isn’t an issue), im instate and got good aid.

Anyone else in the MSME Program? I will be a first year grad student this fall and was hoping to inquire any information in regards to being a longhorn!
Hey longhorns!

I am going to be a longhorn this fall as I recently accepted an offer of admissions to the Master's of Mechanical Engineering program!

Anyone else here who got in? Was wondering if you all had any advice or information as what to expect? I have been having a difficult time communicating with the advisors for info regarding advising appointments, registering, curriculum information and all that other jazz in regard to preparing for college. 

Side note: I spent my undergrad as a red raider and received a Bachelor's of Petroleum Engineering in 2017. Spent the last 4 years as a consultant for drilling, completions and workover/well maintenance.

Should I change my major from biology if I'm struggling hardcore in Genetics?
I don't understand anything at all in my genetics class. I do all of the reading and homework but I still bomb almost every quiz. I'm currently on track to get a C+, which is unheard of for me (getting below a B in any class) and I consider it failing based on my personal standard. I'll definitely be using a covid pass fail. Does this mean I'm better off in a different major? I've heard Fischer's class is supposed to be easy and most people get A- even if they don't understand the material. That means I'm doing something incredibly wrong lol. Or I'm just stupid. I'm also concerned that I'll do badly in upper divs because my foundation in genetics is so poor. Should I change majors now?  


Edit: Thanks so much for the reassurance guys. I'm panicking a little less now.

looking for female roommates !
Looking for a private/double occupancy room with female roommates for Fall 2021-2022.  My budget will be \~700 including utilities, internet, etc, and would prefer a furnished room, but I’m okay without it. Also, I am vegetarian, so if you are vegetarian/vegan, that would be great, but it's okay if you're not. Would prefer to live on west campus, walking distance from campus (don't have a car). I'm thinking to live in at Villas on Nueces (but open to other apartments) so let me know if you want to be roommates!

A little about me :

Hi! I'm an incoming freshman for Biomedical Eng with pronouns she/her. I'm from Houston and indian, looking forward to go to UT! I'm clean, and quiet, and would prefer quiet roommates as well. I love watching new shows and movies, shopping and eating :) Please DM if you have a room or want to be roommates or just want to be friends!

A few questions about Quarters on Campus and The Corner apartments...
So with the Quarters, I've seen a lot of stuff about them doing renovations and kicking people out. Does anyone know if that will still be going on this fall? And if so, are there some properties that are done being renovated so it wouldn't be an issue?

I'm currently looking into Nueces House at the Quarters, so if anyone has details they'd like to share about how nice the apartments are there, any issues they've come across, etc. I'd appreciate it :) And it can be about any of the properties, the only one I know I won't be staying at for sure is Karnes House. The reviews on Google are extremely mixed so idk.

As for The Corner, I've seen that it has really good reviews, and the price is good if utilities and stuff are included. A website called Unilodgers said that electricity is included, but I'm not sure that's true. Does anyone know?

And just generally, how expensive are things like water, electricity, renter's insurance on average?

Thanks in advance for the help!

I saw they meet for like 6 hours a week even though they are 3 hour classes?

What were your thoughts if you took one of these?

Undeclared Major and Internal Transfer Priority
For internal transfer admissions (specifically McCombs and CS), does UT prioritize Undeclared majors to give them a major rather than those who already have a major? Wondering because I’ve heard for cs that UT is more inclined to just tell you to do the elements of computing cert if you already have a major.

Whats Ochem like over the summer?
Im planning on taking Ochem at UT through the first session and I'm a little nervous about it. It's web based M-F and no professor is assigned to it yet. 

Does anyone know what it's like or taken it in past semesters? 

Also if that's the only course I'm taking how much should I expect the tuition to be?

I’m burnt out.

--------------------------------------------------
do i have to join a roommate group? thoughts on duren hall? thoughts on llc’s?

--------------------------------------------------
The school burnout is real.
I stared at a ceiling for 15 minutes today at 12 AM, and that was the most satisfying blank out I have had in the past 4 days. I thought back to last semester on how I told myself 5 engineering classes + labs would be a good idea.

Hook em 🤘

Whats the most important things in choosing a roommate?
IS is sleep schedule, common interests, same major, etc?
--------------------------------------------------
Roommate Dynamics: What is your roommate to you?
Im an only child and have never lived with anyone my own age for years together. I kinda want to know what does your roommate become? Like is your roommate your bff of all time that you can tell everything and anything to and spend 24/7 together inseparably? Or is your roommate a distance acquaintance who you only meet at night and say hi/bye to? Or is a roommate who you end up sharing a friend circle with and go out for meals together and join clubs together?

Also what should you be looking in a roommate to choose them?
--------------------------------------------------
Is it possible to reserve a spot for my roommate for on-campus dorms?

Does any community college offer ARA 621K (Arabic 3) that would be accepted at UT?
Hi y’all,

Currently an IRG student who has to fulfill their language requirement in an upper division course. I’m currently in Arabic 2, and am REALLY struggling and was wondering if any community colleges or nearby universities teach the course. 

I really don’t want to tank my GPA with this class but I can’t see any alternatives. Has anyone in IRG found a workaround? I only speak English and am just overall awful with learning languages so any and all suggestions are welcome.

Do I have to take the UT Math Assessment as an Aerospace major?
I am an Aerospace Engineering major entering UT in Fall 2021. I heard about the UT Math Assessment that has to be taken during orientation. I know this assessment is required for CNS, but since I am in Cockrell and have met the Calculus Readiness Requirement, do I still have to take the assessment?

Any insight will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Any UT pre-dental students? How was your experience at UT doing pre-dental reqs
Incoming plan 2+ bs psych major. I was kind of 50/50 between dental school and medical school but the cosmetology aspect of being a dentist wins me over. ( I love being hands on and basically anything related to cosmetology). I think plan 2 will help me when trying to be distinct from other applicants during dental school interviews and applications so Im rlly grateful for that aspect. Any one have any advice or want to share what it was like perusing pre-dentistry at UT? I’m not very strong in stem fields so I’ll prolly have to study a lot to maintain a good gpa along with the fact I’m kind of confused in a lot of areas regarding steps to take since I’m first gen. My majors aren’t traditional pre-dentistry majors but honestly I feel like I could find ways to cram the required classes even if it meant taking some over the summer. Also how distracting is UT’a environment? I don’t want to blame my adhd but I have pretty bad adhd and can struggle a lot in time management. Ik that I have to work on that if I plan on getting into dental school lol.
--------------------------------------------------
1 hour short from 100% Audit
I’m a senior government major. I’m literally one hour short from having a complete 100% audit for my degree. My registration for summer classes is tomorrow morning. Does UT accommodate situations like this? Can I just take a single hour course of some sort instead of a full course? Will this negatively impact me graduating on time? Thanks a lot! Also, if anyone knows the email or number to directly contact UT about this I’d really appreciate it.

Moody College Internship for COM 323

2 Week wait for a CMHC Brief Check-up.... Is this normal??
Hello,

I have not been feeling too hot recently. I went to go make an appointment to talk to a CMHC counselor and the soonest appointment is may 4th almost 2 weeks from now. I could really use the help right now so I wanted to know if this is expected, how long after the brief check-up it will take to get to an actual counselor or therapist, and if there is any way to cut down the wait.

&#x200B;

Any help or information would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.

Thoughts on CC 302 Intro to Rome Web-Based?
I'm planning on taking my VAPA next semester and am trying to pick an easy one since I'm taking 12 hours of science courses. I was hoping to get a VAPA that also carries the GC flag. I was wondering if I could get some insight on the web-based Intro to Ancient Rome course, such as how the course is structured and what quizzes/exams are like. My other top VAPA choice would be ARC 308 with Speck, but to do so I would have to take another class at 8 AM (which I would prefer not to, but Speck is a pretty cool dude)

Taking CS 314 as a Non-CS Major
I was planning as taking CS 314 in the fall as a non-CS major, but someone told me that only CS majors can take the class. However, the course schedule doesn't specify that the course is restricted to CS majors only, so I was wondering if anyone knows whether non-CS majors can take the course during the fall semester or not.

Worth taking AP Macro exam/What are Plan ii's AP requirements?
I am wondering what the requirements for ap scores are regarding Plan ii. I am currently debating whether or not I should take my AP english literature and Macro exam. 

I am aware that the literature exam will not opt me out of the Plan ii english classes (nor do I wanna opt out!) but when I double major in something else such as government or a foreign language, will that english literature credit come in handy (though to be fair I also have a 4 from English language so I'm not sure whether I need the credit)? If I meet the requirement for one major in a core principle such as english, does that mean I have met that requirement for the same principle in a different major?  
Additionally, I was wondering about whether it would be advised I take the macro exam. I was not able to find the minimum scores for AP macro (I believe the link is broken actually for the plan ii ap score requirements). I plan on double majoring, though I do not know for sure what I want to major in. Because I do not know what I want to double-major in, would it be advised I take the macro exam, or is it more beneficial learning-wise to take the economics classes at UT?
--------------------------------------------------
Has anyone or someone they know who had their bike stolen on campus ever recover it?
Title says it all. I'm pretty pissed at myself for letting this happen, I didn't have the best bike lock since I rarely lock it up on campus and keep it inside my apartment when not in use. The bike was registered with UT and already filed a report with UTPD. It was taken from the middle of campus, so I'm hoping UTPD is able to find some security footage. 

Is there anything else I can do on my own or am I essentially out of luck?

How is the Korean program at UT?
Hey guys. I'm really interested in studying Korean going forward since I'm looking to add Asian Studies as a major. I don't know a lot about the Korean program here at UT aside from the fact that it's relatively small and I need 15 credit hours to meet the requirements for a minor. Can anyone speak to what studying Korean is like here? Thanks in advance.

Picking between E 316L, 316M, 316N, 316P
I need to take an English course for my humanities credit in the core curriculum. Do you have any suggestions on which one to take/which professor? Also, is there an equivalent course I can take at ACC to get this credit? I have both the GC and CD flag already, so getting those flags aren't really a consideration for me. Thanks in advance!
--------------------------------------------------
Are summer classes hard?
Considering taking one in English to fulfill an area that I'm otherwise uninterested in, so that it's quicker.  


However, it'd be class for a month, all weekdays, 1:30h each - and I don't know if assignments are gonna be basically the same workload and complexity, but at a quicker pace, or an easier class that skips on stuff and has fewer assignments (as used to be at the community college I went at)?

want to go UT Austin in Mid-30s
 

Last time I was in school was 11 years ago going to ACC.

I want to back to school to enrich my life but also to overcome one of my biggest insecurities, which is not having a college degree.

I'm stuck on the idea of getting a business degree from UT Austin or nothing.

Mid thirties male, no kids, semi-remote-flexible job that pays 75K a year (but also work 60+ hours a week), own a house 3 miles from UT.

Fastest way to get it done?  
Cheapest Way?

Would you recommend that a foreign teacher makes a letter of recommendation for me?
Hey guys, quick question

I'm a student in college who would like to transfer to UT Austin for Fall 2022 for RTF. Right now I'm thinking of who could write a good letter of recommendation for me based on some tips I have seen online (Person has seen your attitude in times of high stress, can name your attributes but still be objective about your faults, etc), the first person who came to mind was a Teacher of mine in High School who gave me classes like Literature and Communications. The thing is that I didn't live in the United States during High School and therefore, she would be foreign, I'm not sure if that can affect the credibility of her while writing me a letter of recommendation. 

Would she be a liable option to write me a letter of recommendation?

Any comment would appreciated!

P.S She would write the letter in English

Is it common for people to screenshot groupme messages to report to the professor?
Say there's no TA or Tutor in the groupme and roughly 60 people in the group. All are either sophomores or juniors in an upper level class, meaning we've relatively matured and are friends/know most people in it. Is it common if an answer is sent in the groupme (that is incorrect) and was done so accidentally before the deadline of an assignment, that someone would screenshot it and report?

Would the person who sent the message even get in trouble if it was a wrong answer and they stated such?

Off-Campus Living West Campus

Also, How is living on campus in terms of upkeep, maintenance, disturbance or inconveniences. 

Should I go to dorm or apartment for freshman year?

Questions about Fall 2021 Schedule - [CS Major/Senior]
Hello!

I am a CS senior, planning to graduate in Fall 2021. Since I was an external transfer at UT, my schedule looks a bit unconventional. I don't have a formal specialization in my degree plan per se, but I am really into Machine Learning.

Here's what I plan to take in the fall semester:

* CS331 - Algos w/ Fraij
* CS349 - Contemporary Issues in CS w/ Peterson
* CS363D - Data Mining w/ Beasley
* For this one, I am really confused. I am debating between **CS342 Neural Networks with Kraehenbuehl** and **CS378 Ethical Hacking with Prosise.**   
I'm afraid if I take Neural Networks, my schedule would be overloaded & I can't possibly give enough time to my other classes. On the other hand, I'm not really sure about the material taught in Ethical Hacking. Do you learn something practical in Ethical Hacking?  
Also, if you have any other CS classes to suggest, please feel free to list those as well. 

I would sincerely appreciate any advise.  
(And yes, they'll let me take 4 CS classes because I'm a senior).

Thanks!

assistance with medical withdrawal for semester
hey y’all I’m going to keep it short and spare everyone the sob story

i am ungodly behind in all my classes, failing all of them and will not be passing by the end of the semester, i could in theory use all my covid drops but i feel like i don’t have enough for all my classes? idk and don’t you get penalized for dropping a certain amount of hours anyways? 

i have disabilities and mental illnesses that I’m dealing with and I’m finally in the process of getting registered with SSD

can anyone tell me if they’ve already medically withdrawn from ut for the semester and what the process was like? or if you’re comfortable, tell me what your explanation was because i feel like my situation is bad but then again so many people probably have it way worse and why would they accept me I’m paranoid they’ll say no and i’ll flunk out 

it’s already close to the end of april and idk how long an appeal takes and i don’t want to be worrying about this last minute, please help walk me through this or explain your experience thank you

Computational Science: UT vs Harvard/MIT?
I'm an international student making a big decision here. UT is better than Harvard in fields related to Computational Science, but I'm still not sure because Harvard students can take courses at MIT, which ranks higher than UT. 

Since I won't stay in the US after I finish my program, I don't care about which would land me a better job. I just want to get the best experience - learn as much as I can (especially things that would not be easily available online, like CS50); meet interesting people and contribute to research; but Idk which school is better for this. 

Thanks!

CS & McCombs Double Major
Hey guys. I am currently a second year CS student. However I am really interested in finance and would like to double major in McCombs.

I was wondering how would the process for applying for a double major look like especially because McCombs is a harder program.

Also how long would it take me to graduate if I did a double major. I wanna make sure that it doesn’t take longer than 5 years.

On that same page, is a business minor a good idea if I am unable to major in it? 

Thank you!

In need of internal transfer advice to McCombs BHP from undeclared UGS
Hi,

I’m currently undeclared in Undergraduate Studies and wanting to transfer internally into the McCombs BHP. These are the sources I’m using as a guide:

https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/8qvfxg/a_guide_for_internally_transfering_into_mccombs/

https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/CBHP/Admissions/Sophomore-Applications

I will need to take Calculus 1 and 2, and micro and macroeconomics. I’m not sure whether to take these inside or outside of UT, as I’ve heard they look at the grades for these classes even if you take them outside of UT. I could also just get them out of the way this summer before starting in the fall. However, within UT, I’ve read that they are the GPA killers and transfer grades don’t count towards GPA but admissions do look at them. What is the best plan for succeeding in these to get into the BHP? As reference, I’ve only received A’s in IB in high school so I’m not extremely worried about GPA unless the classes are just that hard. The BHP admissions site says “Students are advised to enroll in classes such as Government, History, Calculus, and Economics at the University of Texas at Austin during their freshman year to show a challenging course load.”

As for my other classes, what should I fill my schedule with? What else is required and will be most beneficial for my path into the McCombs BHP?

For extracurriculars, what are the clubs, organizations, and fraternities that would be a good idea to join for experience and leadership related to business and finance? Would some sort of business summer program help? Currently, I have an internship/position at a financial literacy company. Would another internship be smart to get?

If there’s anything that I’m missing and should know, I’m happy to hear. Thank you all for the help.

Has anyone else been filmed, without permission, by a man on The Drag?
Walking south on the Drag today, near 24th St, I noticed a man to my left who was self-filming with his cell phone.  While waiting for a walk sign I noticed him move the phone towards me, but noticing that I was looking at him, he stopped.  When the walk sign came on he jogged ahead, still filming himself, then turned the phone right at me, then back to him, talking the whole time.  Why would someone do this, is it a thing, and is there any action a person should take?   I was wearing a mask; he was not.

What specs should a physics major (interested in research) look for in a computer?
I'm going to be a freshman physics major at UT starting in the fall semester so what should look for in a computer regarding CPU, GPU, RAM, etc? Also, should I look for something more powerful if I am considering participating in research?

a note to all of us students feeling saddo
Hello, hello :) I'm a UT student (yeah, duh). i saw the recent post of someone needing a private place to cry. and ... i wanted to say - if you're feeling sad or lonely, or feel like you're missing out on the best part of your life ... that's all good. i have a personal theory that telling young adults that college (and our 20s) *must be*, and simply *has to be* the "best" part of our lives, actually sets a weird expectation for us to live our lives in a specific way at this age.

BUT, ignoring that b/c who actually gives a shit haha ... i get you. my friends get you. most ppl at UT get you. so, if you're sitting in your room crying, or sitting on the curb of a street weeping, or hiding in the bathroom trying to stifle your sobs ... i get you. to be honest, i don't really know what this post is supposed to be ... i just know that when im feeling sad, it's nice to see that ppl, esp random ppl, have felt the same. next year is gonna be diff, and tomorrow can be different. if you wanna talk, more ppl than not are willing to listen.

it's also 12:15 AM when i write this so this is how im spending a friday night. and it feels kind of good. hope you're doing fine :)

UT Austin (Michener) writing MFA student featured on podcast
We recently featured a student from the Michener Center for Writers on our podcast, MFA Writers. The show is meant to be a resource for prospective applicants, as well as highlight emerging writers. There's a lot of opaqueness around the MFA application process and we aim to provide greater information and transparency. The goal is to provide an opportunity to hear from real creative writing students about their experiences in their programs.

If you're interested, MFA Writers is available on all major podcasting platforms (and some minor ones, too). You're always welcome to reach out to us with feedback or program requests, as well. We want this to be an informative and useful resource for emerging writers.

Thanks all!

Can I Cancel my dorm contract????
My planned room mate recently backed out, and I have another friend planning to live off campus and needs help splitting the cost of his rent. I’ve seen some forms saying that is not a legitimate reason to cancel the contract, but i feel like it’s so far in advance it could be possible. I’m finishing up my first year, and had initially decided to renew the contract, as I thought my room mate would do the same. Now i’ll be alone in the dorm and paying more than the aforementioned rent, and I’d really fuckin love not to. especially for my second year, i feel like being alone will mess me up, this year was already hard enough as it is with a room mate i’ve known for 5 years. does anyone have any experience with cancelling those contracts?? any help would appreciated greatly

Feedback on Lark Apartments
Hi everyone! I’m currently looking at off-campus apartments and came across Lark. I’m considering the 3x3 which is $899 a month (as they advertise but who knows) for those that have lived there or know what it’s like, is it a good place to stay or are they just a company greedy for money with horrible management? How are the rooms? Thanks in advance!

UT Austin or Boston University?
I’m an international student from México 
and I got accepted in UT Austin and BU as an economics major. I’ve been having trouble deciding between both universities or if I should stay here in Mexico. I know both are pretty good options but it’s the hardest decision I ever have to make. What I’m here to ask is for facts about both universities:

Which one is better academically? Which one is more prestigious? Which one has a better social atmosphere for international students? Etc...

Because of the pandemic I haven’t had the chance to visit the campuses but I have been before in UT Austin and I liked it, however I also fear spending my 4 years in the wrong choice. I know whatever I choose will somehow come to be the right decision.

Wondering which classes in the ECE Software Engineering track are the hardest?
Hello,

I am currently a freshman in EE312H and was wondering which classes in the Software Engineering/Data Sci tracks are the hardest? Because EE312H so far has been MUCH harder than I expected. Granted, I still like programming and think SWE is the track for me.. I'm just a bit concerned that I'm not good enough for SWE xD. For context, I do not have much prior programming experience at all from high school.

Any input would be appreciated!

ECE at UT or TAMU?
Hi everyone. I got accepted into the honors programs at both schools and i’m getting scholarships from both.
TAMU will still be decently to significantly cheaper for me though(especially if you factor in the rising cost of living in Austin).

Cost isn’t the biggest factor but it’s still important.

My other hold up is that just about everyone I know is going to a&m and I have family living in college station, so I would have a better support system there and probably adjust easier. I would also probably be happier there initially at least for those reasons. Not necessarily “following my friends” but people are an important factor for me. Especially since I wouldn’t know my roommate at UT.

Obviously both are good programs, UT ECE is about as good as it gets though while TAMU is top 15.
I also thought it’s possible I could stand out more at A&M academically. I’m not sure how to take that into acccount. 

Any thoughts or advice? I’ve been stuck for a while and I have no idea what to do :/

Would Project Seed help with med school?
I know that med schools want to see your research experience (it's an unspoken rule). Would Project Seed help with that?

Project Seed is about learning about how children who translate for their parents cope with mental stress and physical wellbeing.

If you are going to workout and you know it is a full reservation, please don't hog the bench press for the entire time.
This is gonna be a little bit of a rant, but I am really tired of going to workout and then basically not being able to do what I want to do because people are hogging a bench press for 30 minutes or sometimes the entire reservation time. Like I totally understand that there are a lot of workouts that you can do with a bench press, and I get that some people like to do full body workouts, but there are only so many bench presses to go around. If there are 20 people coming to a reservation, and only 3 bench presses, you shouldn't have to wait 30 minutes or more for a spot to open up. No one deserves more or less time than anyone else there for the bench press, so please just have some common decency and only use it for 15-20 minutes max if you are going to workout. I know they can't really enforce this, and I also understand it's kinda one of those first-come first-serve deals, but you shouldn't even need to be using a bench press for more than 20 minutes. Idk, just my thoughts, I can't be the only one who feels this way, right?

QOC Renovation food reimbursement
If you live in a QOC apartment that is being renovated, be aware that you have a $30/day meal allowance for each day that you are displaced from your apartment. The administration conveniently left this information out of any emails in correspondence with the renovations and I found this out from a friend who spoke to one of the managers in the office. 

Save your receipts and then send them all in an email when you're back in your place!!

How did you decorate your dorm?
How did y’all make use of the small amount of space you are given? It’s way too early for me, a hs senior to be thinking about this but is there anything you did that was cool, made use of space, or just nifty? Did y’all go for a specific “aesthetic?” Are there any essentials you would recommend? Thank you! :)

Transferring OneNote content to UT OneNote account
Hi guys! 
My OneNote is running out of storage and I realized we get a lot of storage space if we use our UT email for OneNote. I was wondering how can I move my notebooks over? At first I thought just logging into OneNote with my UT email would transfer them over, but no. I'm not really sure what that did lol. 

Do I need to export every single notebook I have and then import them or is there a faster way?

Thanks! Happy Friday.
