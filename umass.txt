Put too few coins in my dorm's dryer and now it's unusable
I put 3 coins in my dorm's dyer hoping to be able to pay the rest with my ucard debit balance. Turns out your payment must be entirely with quarters or entirely by ucard, when I try to use my ucard the reader says the dryer is in use. "Ok no big deal I'll just hit the coin change button", I thought naively, not knowing that the coin change button does fucking nothing. Now the dryer is stuck waiting for more quarters and I don't have any.

If you want to come to greenough hall to dry your clothes for $0.75 let me know

No Response to my Override Request?
I recently filled out a Google form from the math department to be placed in a full lecture for MATH 300. It's been 3 days now and I haven't received an email. Do the requests take a long time to process? I understand not every override request is granted but I would appreciate them informing me my request was declined.

Anyone else struggling to find off-campus housing?
For some god-forsaken reason, we decided to go for off campus housing. We’ve been looking around for over a month now, but so far no luck. My roommate and I have looked at a couple different places/talked with a few other potential roommates, but things keep falling through. Maybe some of  this is also just the stress of finals season, but it’d be a relief to know that others are experiencing this too.

Tamales sour cream
I love getting quesadillas at tamales, with sour cream and hot sauce on the side for dipping. Today when I got my sour cream it was completely liquid, not the usual texture. I asked about it and the cashier told me that it was normal and its all they had, she even went out of the way to pour me a cup of it from the sour cream they put in the bowls and burritos (super nice lady). Has anyone eaten the runny sour cream? Did you get sick, or is runny sour cream normal and I just have never seen it/noticed?

Has anyone ever rented at Salem Place?
My roommates and I are looking to take over a lease for a condominium at Salem Place and are talking to a guy named Gonen. I can't find any information about him and hes asking for money before the lease signing (lease is a google doc of one page) it kinda feels fishy but the offer is really enticing. Can't tell if hes just unprofessional/doesn't know what hes doing or a criminal mastermind.

Library Job!(or something else)
I really want to apply for a job this summer and land one for the fall semester. I'm keen on a library job but I don't know who to contact/reach out to. Does anyone have any references that I can get?

I'm also down for anything else, the official student job board doesn't have too many options. Any email IDs or other contact info I could get from people with on campus jobs currently, would be awesome!

Off-campus roommate
Hey guys! I'm a rising sophomore, and I'm looking for an off-campus roommate for the fall. I was considering renting an apartment at North 116 Flats (I'd be willing to look elsewhere as well - potentially Vesta Apartments), and I was hoping that someone else here was looking for a roommate/knows someone who is. I'd be happy to chat more to figure out the details/get to know each other first. :)

Incoming Student Looking to Transfer to Computer Science
Hello,

I am a incoming high school senior who has been accepted to UMass for Computer Engineering. However, I am interested in transferring to Computer Science when I arrive. I have the AP credit to skip Physics 151, Math 131, and ComSci 121. Does anyone know what my transfer contract would look like? How hard would it be? What would my first semester look like?

Worcester Clam Chowder
According to the UMass Dining app, Worcester is supposed to have “Homemade Clam Chowder.”

I want homemade clam chowder.

Every time I see “homemade clam chowder,” I end up going and do not receive any of the aforementioned homemade clam chowder.

Historically, this has happened VERY FREQUENTLY during my time at UMass.

Can someone please confirm the presence of homemade clam chowder at Worcester for me?

Fool me once UMass, shame on you. Fool me 15+ times, shame on me.

"Subbaswamy recently informed us that UMass would not be addressing any of our concerns or implementing any of our suggested changes”

Please give me your honest advice
I am from India and I just committed recently to UMass for CS but now with the covid disaster in India and a recent conversation with a family friend who’s a US resident, my parents are completely freaked out. Well the condition in India is very bad and we thought US was getting better but the family friend we had conversation with said that US is not too far from India in terms of having a covid disaster and said that there’s been a lot of deaths recently in her area and US is also not reporting the precise number of deaths and cases. Plus, there might be a new wave in fall. 

My parents have decided that they do not want to send me to US right now (at least for the fall 2021 semester)(btw I am a minor).The way it’s going either a deferral or remote Fall 2021 session will be favourable for me but UMass is reopening entirely for the fall and they are providing no guarantee yet about how the situation will be handled for international students. Can international students be forced to come on campus for fall 2021 if the covid cases decline? Also they say they allow deferral only for extenuating circumstances: but what exactly is that? Will the rising covid cases and anxiety/no parental consent over it be a good enough reason? Will I be at loss if I choose to study remotely? 

Also I haven’t declined my other uni option (Drexel) yet and recently I got an email from them stating that they’re allowing all international students to opt for remote learning in fall (with or without extenuating circumstances). Drexel will be more affordable to me than UMass (both online and offline). Tomorrow is the last day to commit and I’m so confused. I will also be taking a loan for UMass and I’m so scared of making the wrong choice. I obviously like UMass more than Drexel but Drexel seems to be more flexible in accommodating internationals. Any advice would be appreciated so much. Thank you!

CS Course Selection
Hey y’all. I’ve been wondering if it’s a good idea to take CS311-Algorithms (with Sitaraman), CS383-AI (with Rattigan) and CS 490-NLP (with Brendan O’Connor and Laure Thompson). 

Will it be difficult to manage all of them considering the shift back to online; I’ve been slacking off a lil because of how the online classes are structured now. 
Any help is appreciated!

UMass Amherst or UVM?
I'm a high school senior from NJ trying to decide between University of Vermont and University of Massachusetts Amherst. I originally didn't want to go anywhere but University of Vermont, but I was waitlisted from UVM at first. So I visited UMass a few weeks ago, really liked it, and committed. A few days ago, UVM asked if I was still interested and accepted me. Now I'm conflicted about where I should go and I'd love any advice or pros/cons about either college.

Some background: Both colleges offered me pretty good scholarships making both affordable options, although UMass is still less expensive and I already paid my deposit to them. I can definitely see myself at UMass, but a few months ago I could only picture myself at UVM. 

Some stuff about me: I'm interested in majoring in the social sciences, likely sociology or psychology. I love to ski but hate to hike. I don't smoke weed but I'm open to partying and alcohol. Not a huge fan of sports but I think school pride is fun.

Anything you guys have to say is appreciated! I posted this in the UVM subreddit as well just to get opinions from both communities :)

How did housing work out for everyone?
This sub was blowing up with posts about the on-campus housing fiasco a few weeks ago, but it seems to have died down a bit by now. At the time, it seemed like most people didn't get the rooms they wanted and a lot of people were worried about getting a spot on campus at all. I felt lucky that I got an on-campus dorm, even if it wasn't in the area I wanted.

How did it work out for you? Did the rooms they opened up later in the process alleviate some of the stress? Did a lot of people end up not getting rooms? If you need to find off-campus housing, how is that going?

Second, it it true that there are only shared bathrooms and showers?

Is BME worth it?
Currently an engineering major and my plan was to pick biomedical, but I've had parents and friends tell me that mechanical or electrical is a smarter choice because they're more highly sought after by employers. Honestly I think I'd enjoy pretty much any branch of engineering so I'm not super set of BME just yet, although it currently sounds the most interesting. Do any current or past biomedical engineering (or any other type) students have any perspective on what the major is like or the job market?

Edit: 

Please suggest a residential hall for me because I cannot decide even after going through every resource:

- I like to stay in newer buildings as I’m crazy scared of insects and mice
- I am veg (don’t know if it matters?)
- I am a bit shy so making friends would definitely be hard for me +  I’m not gonna drink or smoke (or go to parties during covid times) 
- I am a CS major but that doesn’t mean I’m into techy and gamer thing
- I am serious about academics so I would like to have a serious about studies but still fun friend group. 
- I like to do early morning studies (not late night) and would sleep not too late

Chemical vs Mechanical
Hey! I’m going to be applying to umass amherst next year for either chemical or mechanical engineering. Umass is my top choice right now and I want to make sure I get in. I heard all engineering and cs students have to take the same classes for the first 2 years and then they branch out. If this is true, does it matter what kind of engineering major I put down on my application. If there is a difference, would it be easier for me to get in as a chemical or mechanical? Thanks bois

UMass Amherst CS vs UW Madison CS?
UMass is 15k cheaper for me per year and UW will land me up in debt but I’m feeling like I should go to UW as it has way better overall rankings. Honestly the only thing putting me off is that UMass hasn’t had a lot of great alumni and the students just don’t feel competitive enough as I am somebody who works hard ONLY through peer pressure and harder courses. Also I am interested in startups and UMass doesn’t seem to have anybody interested in startups and all at all and the whole place seems to be where everyone just wants a degree and a job and not a lot motivated. I know it sounds really bad coming from someone who hasn’t even been there and posting it on UMass’ sub Reddit. But can someone please guide me out with only 2-3 days left for confirmation deposition deadline. Personal message me if possible.

Also please don’t downvote as I NEED some REAL ADVICE

I would like to take Spanish 2 over the summer at UMASS, the only information I can see is that it is online. Is it online asychronous or does it have weekly zoom meetings ? It says there is a prerequisite but if I have studied Spanish for 4 years would that suffice ? How difficult is the course ?

r/clep

The summer before last I took the college comp CLEP test to get out of ENGLWRIT 112. That specific test itself was fairly easy if you have a background in English from high school. They do cost money, I don't think UMass will cover them, but the website Modern States sometimes will if you complete the course.

Anyway, I'd recommend it if you're interested.

edit: apparently they can do them remotely. They might charge an additional fee though and they use proctor software.

Lastly, could you give me any input to what to expect when taking summer classes.

Help me decide
What do you guys think of Isenberg? Like in general: diversity (large Asian community?), courses, professors, opportunities, students’ life,...

I’m an international student and I’m still considering between Isenberg and Lebow (Drexel university) for my Undergraduate business degree. Please help me 😭 The tuition is literally the same for both because I’m international. Thank you so so much 🥺

Tips for studying for finals while deeply depressed?
I have a lot to do, I'm behind in a couple of classes, and I'm burned out. And now, finals loom.

I've also been very depressed since January and it's getting worse, not better. (I see someone at CCPH and have started a new antidepressant, but it's not working yet.)

Does anyone have any suggestions for studying for finals? Not to be dramatic but I feel like all my energy goes into getting out of bed, eating, and just ... existing. I can't concentrate for more than ten minutes.

Small, manageable, practical tips are welcome. Anything, really.

Meal plan for off campus students
Hello! So next semester for my senior year I’ll be off campus, and I was wondering if having one of those YCMP meal plans is worth it. My logic is the fact that I have classes plus two jobs on campus will have me there for a the majority of the day and having at least 1 meal a day there makes sense. I know how to cook and I won’t be completely reliant on this meal plan for my meals but I was thinking breakfast and dinner I make myself and lunch/ a coffee on campus Mon-Fri. Let me know what you guys think / any advice, thanks!

Transferring into Computer Science
I'm a high school senior who was recently accepted into the College of Engineering at UMass Amherst. My first choice major was computer science. I know that the computer science program is very selective at UMass. I was wondering how difficult it is to transfer into the computer science program. If I get good grades throughout my freshman year and take the required classes to transfer, do you think I would have a good chance of being accepted into the computer science program?

What should I do if one of my professors is being unclear about when my makeup exam is?
I requested a medical makeup exam for one that was originally at the beginning of April. He accepted it and asked me to "let him know when I am ready", so I picked a date 5 days later. He agreed and asked me to, "remind him a day before". So I did, but he said he needed more time to create an exam. It has been two weeks since then and I reached out to him twice.  Every time he will just respond " we need more time" and is being very unclear about when my exam might be. 

Is this a normal occurrence? I never requested medical makeup before, but the unclearness is making me very anxious. The final week is coming up so I do not want another one on top of everything else I have. 

Is there someone else I can reach out to?

Anyone else severely burnt out?
I’m not having a good time y’all. 

I keep failing physics exams even though I study a ton. I go to every study session. I always attend lectures and do the homework. I know I’ll get at least a C- in the class. Still, I feel like all my hard work is going to nothing. 

Chem is making less and less sense. My prof’s explanations rarely line up with owl. We also just have a ton of assignments from him.

My “easy” gen Ed is not easy at all. It’s so damn difficult. My grade relies on only three assignments. The dude never makes sense either.

The only thing I like about math is my ta. What the fuck is infinity smh. 

I keep looking for the light at the end of the tunnel or potential days off, but I don’t see any in the near future. Wellness Wednesday is a fucking joke. And all umass cares about is money. I have to take summer classes to graduate in four years, so I guess my next break is during winter 22. I’m just so exhausted. Anyone else feel like this? Surely, it’s not just me :(

advice for placement exams
title :0

incoming freshman and the placement exams opened up. i think i need a score of at least 20 (not sure what it's out of) on math to get into math 131 (calc 1) which is the goal as i took precalc this year in hs.

overall, are they hard? what can i expect on the math exam(s) and what's the writing exam like? writing has a 2 hour limit, seems rough.

thank u in advance!!!

edit: took math. took less than an hour for both tests even tho there was an hour given for each. pretty solid considering i used a calculator (allowed). don’t really need to study. good luck to anyone else taking it.

Handing over lease in summer
So it feels like most places off campus only do 12-month leases. I was told to use facebook to find somebody to take the rest of my lease and that is 98% of people do but thats just somebody who works there. Can people vouch that this works so I dont end up paying an additional 3 months that I should have already left campus?

PSU/USA Response to Chancellor’s Fall Reopening Plan
As union leaders of the Professional Staff Union and University Staff Association, we wanted to offer a few initial thoughts on Chancellor Subbaswamy’s [email today regarding fall reopening](https://umass.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=561fa27799bd9468bec92977c&id=9be43c08b4&e=e28608fe20), as well as the administration’s just-released [Fall 2021 Operational Plan](https://umass.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=561fa27799bd9468bec92977c&id=a0078b32a8&e=e28608fe20).

**Onsite vs. Remote Work**

The chancellor’s pronouncements that 1) all employees are to be considered onsite this fall, and only hybrid or remote if “approved by a unit’s vice chancellor,” and 2) the “transition of staff back to campus back should continue through the spring semester and through the summer as operational need dictates,” would be contingent on Governor Baker ending his declaration of a COVID-19 state of emergency, including the Phase IV [office occupancy requirements (currently at 50%)](https://umass.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=561fa27799bd9468bec92977c&id=9232df7700&e=e28608fe20), which encourages employers to “have workers continue to telework if feasible.” Until the governor ends the COVID-19 state of emergency, our COVID-19 agreements that include hybrid and remote work must remain in effect. 

Working conditions are fundamental, mandatory subjects of bargaining, and we will hold the university to their legal obligation to negotiate with us. We have heard from many of our members about the importance of remote and flexible working arrangements, and we are in the process of organizing all-member meetings to help set our unions’ priorities on these issues. Watch for details soon. 

Finally, when the pandemic and state of emergency is declared over, our contractual language regarding flexible schedules and remote work are still in effect and must be followed. We’ll have more details soon, but for now, this language can be found in Section 18.4 [of our current contract](https://umass.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=561fa27799bd9468bec92977c&id=942a2d9114&e=e28608fe20) (see pages 37–38).

**Funding Details**

Frankly, we found the chancellor’s discussion of the university’s finances to be disappointing. In this message, he continues to obscure our financial footing while failing to provide the details that we have requested about the use of funds from the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF). For now, please note the following:

* The chancellor fails to acknowledge the cost savings from member furloughs, VSIPs, and vacancies—which have increased the workloads of all remaining staff and faculty. 
* The $25 million going to students in HEERF III will free up $25 million that was already budgeted to student aid, allowing the previously allocated $25 million to be used for institutional needs, including staffing. Combined with the $25 million from this package that is allocated to institutional needs, we are actually seeing a $50 million gain in available funds that should be used to support our students and bring staff back.
* We have significant concerns about putting the excess HEERF money into a “Contingency Reserve Fund,” to be used however administrators see fit. While we are pleased to see that the chancellor acknowledges that this reserve could be used to avert any future furloughs, UMass staff deserve a signed agreement that provides for full staffing and employment security, and we deserve it now. Chancellor Subbaswamy already has access to tens of millions in HEERF funds, and has yet to choose to use these funds to assist or even bring back our workers who remain on indefinite furlough and time reductions. 

While the chancellor took a moment to thank students, faculty, and staff for “persevering” through the last year, he gave no thanks to any of us for willingly stepping up and sacrificing 6% of our pay through last year’s voluntary furloughs. He offered no acknowledgment or even basic human sympathy for those forced into indefinite furloughs, who have had to face housing and food insecurity, and navigate unemployment because UMass insisted on transferring the costs of the pandemic to their own employees—while over $400 million in available funds sat in the bank, untouched.

And while listing his thanks for those who helped secure recovery funds, he offered no recognition of Labor’s role in advocating for and securing: three rounds of HEERF funding, additional COVID-19 relief funding to the Commonwealth, and level funding from the Commonwealth to UMass.

UMass CS Lab Sciences
I know as a CS Major you have to take 8 credits or 2 lab sciences. I was planning on taking Geology 103, but then I saw that on the CS requirements page, it says 103/131. Does this mean that I have to take BOTH 103 AND 131 for it to count as 1 lab science?
I noticed that 103 doesn’t have a Lab section attached to it, so does that mean I need to take both of these classes (103 AND 131h in order to fulfill one of the class requirements?

UMass requiring all students returning in the fall to get a COVID vaccine.
For those of you who didn’t get the email: 

“Our efforts will focus on offering students a full residential, in-person college experience in September safely. **We will require all undergraduate and graduate students who wish to live or learn or conduct research on campus or access campus resources to be fully vaccinated prior to the beginning of the fall semester,** on the basis of expected additional state, federal and legal guidance and vaccine availability, and subject to religious and disability accommodations pursuant to state and federal law. Evidence to date concerning the present and expected approval status and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines supports the university’s position.”

Why isn’t the school worried about going “back to normal” next semester?
Reading through their website I don’t see any exact measures they will take when one person gets sick. They only vaguely speak of the possibility of a few dorms designated for quarantine. Is this allowed? Why is no one worried? With all dorms in such close proximity and shared bathrooms and rooms is there really a practical way to avoid getting covid? I’d say bathrooms should at least have a HEPA air purifier or something since thats where we take off our masks to brush our teeth and stuff. And  don’t even get me started on the dining halls. Even with social distancing, the dining halls have people going in and out all day, same air circulating around if they eat indoors. I don’t know, but I do not feel safe at all returning to campus. To me it seems as though they can’t afford to keep dorms empty, and with so many new buildings I can see why they probably wouldn’t want that to go to waste. Though being extremely strict such as temperature checks to enter dorms would be too excessive, I just think there are small ways to contain it like providing more ventilation in high occupancy areas such as bathrooms and dining halls. I’m curious how others feel about returning to campus.
--------------------------------------------------
How are the triple dorms?
So I wanted to get a dorm at Northeast and found one open, however it’s a triple. I’m curious on how that would work. It doesn’t look substantially bigger than the double. I couldn’t find any good pictures of the triples online. Do any of you guys have experiences living in them? Was it crowded and would you recommend it?
Thank you.

Geology
Hi, I am looking to take an easy lab science course next semester (just to check off that I completed a gen-ed). I need to take a lab science and I heard that Geology would probably be the easiest course to take (please let me know if I am mistaken).
I do not know much about Geology. To be quite frank, I am not too invested in the content of the course (because I am not majoring in anything close to geology), but my main focus is taking an easy course for Fall 2021. 
I heard from some people that Geology is an easy course. However, I do not which course to take: Geology 101 or Geology 103 (or some other course).
Can someone help me choose please? What’s the difference between the classes and which should I take that will be “easier” and more “fun”?
Thanks!

Wifi and Moodle still down
Hey guys. At about 3 PM yesterday my connection to eduoram randomly crashed along with my Moodle page. Since then I’ve contacted IT about 3 or 4 times by both phone and email and they told me to reset my password in SPIRE on my phone (which I did) and try logging into eduoram with the new password. Both the UMASS and eduoram wifi aren’t working for me and I have no idea what to do as I have a bunch of assignments due tonight and tomorrow and I also have a late housing appointment that opens tomorrow as well. Can someone please help me out and tell me if they had the same problem and how they fixed it because I’m really starting to worry. Thanks!

Does Worcester ever have beef for stir fry, or only tofu / chicken?
Additionally, is there any rhyme or reason as to when Berk has beef as an option for stir fry? I went in at 3:30 and they only had tofu and chicken, whereas on Monday they had beef around the same time. There’s no way to tell by looking at the menu, because it never specifies what meat they have. 

Asking because I do not have an unlimited meal plan and have been disappointed at the lack of beef stir fry more than once this semester :(

Laptop recommendations?
Hello everyone,

I’m looking to get a new laptop before I start at UMASS, and I was wondering if anyone had recommendations for models, especially given that “meets the IT site’s minimum specs” and “works for more than one semester” are two very different things, at least in my experience. I’d appreciate any help that you all are willing to give.

Thanks so much!

Accidentally chose a single, but I want a double, is a swap available?

Anyone living in Mount Ida this summer? Looking for roomate
The last time I posted here, there weren't many people living in Mt Ida over the summer, just looking for an update. And also, do you know where else can I post?

Frustrated with the state of how UMass is handling clubs on campus
I was excited to go back on campus and participate in clubs in person again, but now they are shutting down clubs like Sci fi, anime, and GHL, and preventing others from having physical spaces? Seriously? As a rising senior that transferred in my sophomore year, I've barely even got any time to even have a semblance of a normal experience. I already got screwed by housing this year, and now this... I'm so tired of being promised a return to normal just to see that they decided that yet another thing needs to get screwed up.

Housing Question
Hello UMass,

I'm an incoming sophomore and I missed the deadline for housing appointments by a single day, and now there are no more spots according to SPIRE. I assume this means I should get an apartment, but I know very few people considering I've been doing online for the past year. I am wondering if any of you have had this situation, and just would like some advice so I can prepare (i.e. choosing roommates etc.). Assuming I don't get a room, I guess I won't be able to live dorm life like I wanted to -  oh well.
--------------------------------------------------
Vaccine
Do you think UMass will force us to get injected with the vaccine? I’m looking at their emails and all of them say that they strongly encourage us to get it but it doesn’t seem like we 100% have to. Was there an email I missed that said otherwise?

What is the strangest thing you've ever seen at UMass?
This isn't very scandalous, but a few years ago, I was walking across campus and passed a tour group. Out of nowhere, a student ran up to the group and *screamed*, "YOU ALL SHOULLD KNOW UMASS AMHERST DOESN'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT STUDENTS!" before scurrying away.

Some of the parents looked horrified.

Vaccine appointments available in Amherst tomorrow if anyone is looking

Premed with CS
Does anyone think doing this is a good idea? I want to go on to work with AI in health care but I'm not sure if I should just go for CS with a minor in bio or do a premed track. I have most of the requirements done for premed track because they were requirements for a bio minor but I'm not quite sure if I should do this...

How's life going for y'all?
So I've spent a full YEAR of my college life at home now (I'll become a sophomore next sem), and to be honest, it's getting hella boring sometimes. My area is experiencing a big second wave of COVID, and we're back in lockdown mode. It's getting risky to even leave the house nowadays. 

How are my fellow home-dwellers handling the current situation? How do y'all pass time at home? Are there any active online UMass communities I can join?

Moodle to be more reliable after this semester. It will be replaced by Moodle in the Cloud
[https://www.umass.edu/it/news/20210420/comingspringmoodlehasanewhomesummerfallcourses](https://www.umass.edu/it/news/20210420/comingspringmoodlehasanewhomesummerfallcourses)

UMass is switching from a self deployed version of Moodle to one managed by moonami ([umass.moonami.com](https://umass.moonami.com)), you can already log in! This means that Moodle will be hosted on AWS instead of what I assume to be a closet inside of UMass IT. This should mean that we won't have (as many) problems in the fall and going forward.

Claim your HEERF grant.

Freshie dorm questions
Hi guys, I’m an incoming freshman and I was just kind of looking for an explanation on how housing works. I know a little bit about each area but not nearly enough to have a preference. Also if anyone has any suggestions on what to do about roommates that would be cool. Like everybody else id prefer a single room just because of my social anxiety but I’m figuring that’s near impossible so I’m just trying to figure out what to do.
--------------------------------------------------
Are there any off-campus places near Amherst that does semester-lease? (4 Months)
While I’m still looking for a place to live off campus since it looks like there is no dorms, I’m having little bit of trouble even looking for an off-campus that does Fall Semester lease only. I will be graduating this winter so, I need to find a place that accepts semester-lease only. Do Sylvan or North Apartments do that? Are they worth it? It seems quite overpriced too. While I will be contacting the off-campus housing office tomorrow for any places that do sublet for fall-semester or month by month lease instead, does anyone know if there are any places within 30 min distance that does fall-semester lease or month by month lease?

UMass Amherst Discord Server
Hello everyone! There's a lot of us here who ask questions and whatnot, so I decided I'd advertise a very chill UMass server: [https://discord.gg/5WwdtnUHp3](https://discord.gg/5WwdtnUHp3) .

There are a fair amount of upperclassmen in the server (rising juniors and seniors, and some people who are graduating this year) who will gladly help answer questions. Hope to meet you all there :)

can u get kicked out of the CS program? how large/small are the class sizes?
hi,

so for some schools ive seen that you are required to maintain a 2.7+ in order to stay in the CS program, making it extremely competitive to stay in the program. can you stay in the program regardless of what your gpa is and is there a maximum amount of times you can fail a class?

UMass Guest Swipes and Dining Dollars
Do Guest Swipes and Dining Dollars carry over to Fall 2021? If so, which ones carry over?

Also, are we able to use guest swipes this semester? If not, that kinda feels like a ripoff to get 15 guest swipes and not be able to use them on ppl like your parents when they want to pick you up...

Lastly, where can you use Dining Dollars bc I haven’t used any yet and I was hoping they could carry over, but if they can’t, where should I spend them?

Moodle account suspended
I got booted out of my moodle account a few minutes ago, and now when I try to log in, I get an error message saying: “You seem to be Shibboleth authenticated but Moodle has no valid account for your username. Your account may not exist or it may have been suspended.”

Has anyone had their account suspended due to failure to get required COVID tests? Is this what you saw? I am living locally and was last tested 7 days ago. I did miss a test last week because I completely forgot about it.

Does anyone know if this will be fixed when I go to get tested again, or if it’s something more serious and I should contact somebody at the school about it?

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. I have assignments due this week that have to be submitted through Moodle so I’m kinda freaking out.

Math Department Problem
Honestly, is the Math department all around terrible, or have I just been having the worst luck with the professors? I started at UMass in the Fall of 2020 so all my experience so far has been online. My second major is maths with a concentration in Statistics. 

All the math classes I've had so far have had awful professors. By awful, I mean not trying at all. The stat ones have complied these sheets with notes of stuff we're supposed to know, and they literally just read them out during class. Another math professor sounds like he's about to fall asleep while he's talking. Overall, they all sound very bored, which I get. I am very bored as well. But is this just an online problem? Or is it a sign of a weak-ass department with awful professors? 

If anyone is doing maths with a stats concentration, would you recommend any engaging profs? I've checked all the profs I've had so far on Rate My Professor, and they have okay reviews (the problem is most of the reviews talk about how easy or nice they are - that doesn't necessarily make them good professors though).

How to switch rooms?
Im a junior and I got a room with my roommate in Southwest in one of the towers and im looking to change my room in sw for a room in central. What do I need to do on spire room selection page to allow me to select again for a new room?

Lewis Hall
I selected a room in Lewis Hall a few days ago and just realized it’s home to the defined Asian student community. I’m not Asian, so should I move? I don’t want to intrude or anything.

Edit: Just got a spot in Johnson Hall! Hopefully someone who really wanted to be in Lewis can be there.
--------------------------------------------------
Anyone else here like Sylvan?
My first choice for room selection was sylvan- anyone else here a sylvan homie or do you guys think I’m crazy

Hey so I just selected the 21st floor of washington and did not really check the floor description but does anyone know if it is a LatinX floor. I don't want to go there and be called out on being in the wrong community.

North Apartments
Hi,

I'm a rising sophomore who is considering North Apartments. I am currently in Central and got a room for next year in central but I am so indecisive about living in Central or Southwest bc I don't think I really wanna live in either. I really want to live in North however I am wondering if you think I'll be missing out on meeting more people if I live in North as opposed to a dorm as a sophomore. I've met a lot of people this year but I def wanna meet more and that is the only reason I may want to stay in the dorms for one more year. Thoughts?
--------------------------------------------------
Will the halls that just opened up for room selection primarily be juniors and seniors?
Seeing that sophomores already chose rooms, anyone know if all the halls that just got added be mostly for upper classmen as they are the ones choosing now?
--------------------------------------------------
CHC Suites
So there are a lot of 4 person suites in the CHC with lots of available spaces, like only 1 or 2 people are in the room so far. So even though there are a lot of spaces left, my 4 person group can't get anything. Would anyone in one of these suites be willing to leave it for us? We would be willing to pay you to do it.
--------------------------------------------------
Are there any 24hr quiet rooms left--anyone see any?
Did anyone see any 24hr quiet rooms released today when they were signing up?
--------------------------------------------------
Check roommate name?
Is there a way to go back to seeing my roommates name after selecting my room? i had to sign up so fast i didn’t get to take a picture.

Criminal Justice degree?
Once I'm out of the military, I'm looking to use my GI bill and go back to the college I once worked at full-time - UMass! 

I'm interested in getting a Criminal Justice degree, and I was wondering if anyone here who's enrolled in the Criminal Justice program can tell me how good it is? I know the Isenberg School of Business at Amherst is impeccable, and the engineering degrees are all stellar at this campus, but never really met any Criminal Justice majors at my time I spent there.
--------------------------------------------------
Roommate group?
If someone wants to reselect a room, I know they have to reform their roommate group. If they do so, will their original housing selection still be secured or will they lose it?
--------------------------------------------------
got a room! (junior)
now I won’t have to find off campus housing. very thankful but still angry at this shitshow of a room selection process.

Isenberg Fellows RAP

Off-campus Housing for STEM/CS Students
Hi, as a CS student who can’t seem to secure on-campus housing (thanks umass), and will probably have to live off-campus, where should I try living?
I don’t know anything about where options are and how far the closest places are. I really wanted to live on campus to avoid any sort of long commute, and that is definitely my primary concern, but I was curious if someone could help me out with this.
I want to do a sublet just in case I can move into on-campus housing next semester. 

Any suggestions?
--------------------------------------------------
Anyone in the same boat in regards to housing?
The school is taking forever to come out with an official decision for whether we are returning next semester or not. Personally if online class is offered as an option I'll probably stay home, the same for my roommate. But if we are required to go back then the housing situation is a mess. From what I know there are less available on campus housing spots this year than previous years and a ton of people are being forced to find off campus housing. I couldn't get on campus housing either but I don't know if I should secure a off campus location immediately right now. 

We've filled out applications to some 2b apartments already and even placed a security deposit on the main one we're looking to get. Was contacted last week and told that a spot opened up and asked if I wanted to sign the lease and lock it in. I was tempted but rejected for the time being just because everything is still up in the air and we don't want to be paying for an apartment that we won't be living in if online classes are offered again.

Lots of people are looking for apartments right now and actually just signing the lease because they plan to go back anyways. If we don't act soon, all the available ones within our budget range will be gone. 

Really frustrating. 

Subbaswamy quick it up pls.

Looking to take someone’s lease for townhouses of amherst
Me and 3 of my friends were all unsuccessful in getting good housing for the upcoming school year, ever since we have been on the hunt for off campus housing and are really interested in living in the townhouses of amherst.

Off Campus Housing (Sugarloaf Estates)
I noticed a couple of ppl on this sub are starting to look for off-campus apartments since the process of living on-campus is a shit show rn lol. 

I currently live at Sugarloaf Estates and if you have any questions, feel free to DM me! I personally don't love the location because it's so far away from campus and you have to drive 15 minutes just to go to the grocery stores. The apartment itself though is super nice and clean, with a built in washer/dryer and its generally really quiet here. There's a dog park too which could be a plus if you have pets.

I'm not extending my lease just because there are very few college students here so that combined with the distance away from the school makes you feel really isolated from everything. If you have a car and you don't mind driving a little ways away from campus, Sugarloaf would be good for you! 

Hope this helps someone. Good luck y'all.

Does changing from living on campus to off campus change the amount of scholarship you receive?
Hi all, I’m currently living on campus and I’m hoping to be able to live off campus for the next semester, that means the total expenses for next semester will be less since the room and board fee is not there anymore. And I believe the scholarship I received is more than the cost, so I’m not sure if the school will give me refund or they will adjust the scholarship I received so that there will be no overflow of scholarship.

Fall 21' Housing
Sophomores were supposed ton get priority housing next semester right???? Was anyone else literally not able to get a room? My appointment was on the 16th, and all the rooms were full already. One of my friends who had an appointment just a day before mine was able to get into JQA. Mad annoying and I've contacted residential life, I don't think much Is going to be done. Are more rooms going to open or am I going to have to make an over on hour commute every day?? Just wanted to see if anyone else was stuck and clueless what to do next like me and my roommate are.

Housing Floor Plan
Hello all,  
I'm in the process of choosing housing for the next semester. I'm looking through each hall and seeing what's best for me. I see there are floor plans for each hall. I noticed on the side it tells you which floors are female bathrooms and male bathrooms. However, it does say that it is subject to change. How likely is it to actually change? Let's say floor 2 has the female bathroom so I choose a dorm on floor 2, but at the end it becomes the male bathroom?   
Thanks!

Graduating With Cum Laude?
 I passed failed some classes and so my gpa didn’t tank and I might be able to graduate with cum laude or magna cum laude. But my grad program doesn’t accept pass fails. Is it possible that I graduate (while keeping the pass fails and a higher gpa) and get the cum laude honor and afterwards, I revoke it the pass fails? Would they then revoke my cum laude honors with the new gpa or would they just let me keep it since I already graduated?

Furniture for off-campus housing
Hey guys, 

So I am a grad student. I have heard most grad students prefer off-campus housing since it's cheap and I checked and it's quite true. I have reserved an off-campus appartment with some friends. But I am confused as to where do people buy their furniture? What is the typical one time cost of buying a bed, desk, chair, mattress, locked drawer, cupboards and even room divider for the person living in the living room?

Any info will help :)

If you can't get housing on campus or you're not happy with it, off campus living is an option
I'm a graduating senior and just wanted to offer my thoughts to the people who are (understandably) freaking out about on campus housing next year. If you can't get a room or aren't happy with your choice, I would really recommend looking at off campus housing. If you check out the UMass Housing, Sublets & Roommates group on facebook, there are tons of people trying to get rid of apartments for the summer/year, and living off campus definitely has its benefits: cheaper, more parking (and it's closer than that's closer to your apartment), lots of places are close to campus or on the bus route, closer to stores, etc. I didn't live off campus until this year because I thought being away from campus would make it too hard to get anything done and I didn't want to be far from my classes (which isn't a factor now of course, since everything is online), but it's actually been really nice and I would recommend it to anyone who's thinking about moving off campus. On campus is great, too, but you will not be stranded if you can't get on campus housing!

Jobs!
What interesting summer jobs do you guys have and are any of your workplaces still hiring? I’ve checked the job board but other than the landscaping jobs I’ve already applied to from there, nothing is really grabbing my interest as far as actual work material and salary go. 

Maybe this sounds bad but I’m mostly just looking for jobs that pay $15/hr or more just cause that’s how much I make right now and I don’t wanna have to go backwards. 

Kind of open to anything that isn’t an office job - childcare, outside stuff, whatever - but an office job in an interesting field wouldn’t be the worst thing either. Thanks!

Gap year
Hey guys I am currently a freshman who also got screwed over by housing so I don’t know if I’ll have a place to stay my sophomore year. I also know that Umass is weird about gap years, where you have to go through “re-enrollment” but they don’t really say anything about it. Is it a good idea? Is there a chance that I don’t accepted back in if a take a gap year(Im in Isenberg so I worried it might be tough to get back in). Is anyone else considering taking a gap year? Thanks.

Edit: Thanks guys for all the advice! Good to know there’s some cool people at umass

Who is in charge of the CS major change application process?
Who is the one at the top of the chain overlooking all this process?

I haven't taken MATH132 and I don't plan to take it, cause I already took MATH 233H and got a B

and the math department won't give me the credits for MATH132, the staff in charge of the overrides don't even care that I passed a Calc III, they still require me to take Calc II.

Please give some wisdom to this student

How strict are the quiet floors?
Hi all, super quick question. I had a late appointment and the only room I was able to secure was on the 22nd floor of JQA, aka the 24-hour quiet floor. 

Me and my roommate are not loud, we don’t yell, but we do watch TV and listen to music (not blasting it obviously). Will we be okay? 

The only thing I’ve found on the sub is [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/umass/comments/g1eze5/24_hour_quiet_floor/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) but I’m hoping that somebody who lived there can see this post.

Thank you!

How difficult is it to major switch from the CS Exploratory Track to Computer science?
I'm a (hopeful) incoming freshman to UMass Amherst, and I'm looking at the eligibility requirements to switch and they don't seem that bad. How hard is the actual process in reality?

housing
i’m seeing a lot of incoming sophomores saying they’re going to camp spire during the junior and senior picking times to take the better housing spots of the bunch. please don’t do that. that’s not fair to juniors and seniors.
--------------------------------------------------
When your appointment starts and there are 4 rooms open on campus

--------------------------------------------------
When/how can we see the contact info of who is in our dorm/suite/apartment?
I remember there being a way to do it previously but I think it was a few weeks after house selection, and I don't see anything about it on spire.
--------------------------------------------------
Whose brilliant idea was it to not send people emails about room selection?
UMass usually bombards us with emails about every single event happening, including room selection. Why didn’t they do that again this time? No one I know got ANY notification about it, and 2 of my friends actually missed the appointment request deadline. Given the huge workload and stress we’ve had due to remote learning, it would have helped if UMass sent any sort of reminder about housing appointments. 

Not that we’re going to have any place to live on campus anyway.
--------------------------------------------------
Another housing question
I'm a freshman going into my sophomore year, and due to some IRL circumstances I got distracted and completely missed the housing deadline. I submitted a housing appointment request yesterday, but from what I've been seeing, it seems like I'm gonna be screwed and have to find some place off campus.

Is there any hope? Do I have any chance at getting on campus housing?
--------------------------------------------------
North Apartments
How did north apartments fill up so fast if it’s only for upperclassmen and most of us have our appts on the 20th and 21st? I was checking the slots and it had so many sophomores on it. Did UMass mess up? There’s 200 students per building and 4 buildings so I wonder how many spaces are taken up. I hope there’s enough opening up on the 20th for the rest of the upperclassmen. I can’t afford to live off campus as my financial aid pays for my housing and I don’t want a meal plan this year either
--------------------------------------------------
Housing question
I am a rising junior but had my appointment time already. I don’t want to live with a bunch of freshman/sophomores in where I would end up. What should I do? How do I change if need be? I just would feel more comfortable living with upperclassmen
--------------------------------------------------
Why on-campus housing is so limited this year?
I cannot get the reason behind why so many students choose to live on campus this year. I am an incoming senior and I will be able to select room 4.21 and there's almost no room currently. (I know my priority is 16000+ but I was a student of this priority before but able to get on-campus housing.)
--------------------------------------------------
Junior / Senior housing - call to action lol
Hi! 
I am a rising senior at Umass. I am having a lot of issues with how Umass has handled housing this semester and after coming on here I see others have issues with the housing process too. I am not sure what can be done but I do plan on contacting the school and seeing what can be done for us juniors and seniors as this is unfair. My friend / roommate and I failed to receive any emails from housing with information regarding fall 2021 housing. We were shocked to find out the whole process had already began and that we had such low priority. We were previous North Apartment residents and had anticipated residing there for our senior year. 

Basically, I want to reach out to Umass and voice my concerns. This pandemic has caused stress for everyone and their lack of communication and flawed process has added to the stress. 

In numbers (students, friends, parents) if we speak up I wonder what change could come about? I plan on emailing whoever need be to get this resolved.

Anyone have any ideas on how to get the ball rolling? Not sure what kind of document to get started to show there are so many of us who are upset by the housing process. 

Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------
Did any rising sophomores get a good room selection??
I understand that on Reddit people who have a bad experience with things will voice their opinion, while those who had a smooth experience don’t have a reason to voice their opinion for the most part - which is why everyone here is complaining about getting sylvan or no housing at all 

...so I’m just curious, are there any rising sophomores that actually had multiple options to chose from?? Like could you pick from different housing areas not just a handful of buildings?

I transferred to UMass last summer after my first semester of my freshman year (started college spring 2020), couldn’t live in campus fall 2020 obviously, and now I’m deferring.  I’ve never lived on campus at UMass, and throughout my 2 year college career I’ve lived on a college campus for a whopping 8 week bc of covid. Anyways I don’t think sylvan will be as bad as ppl hype it up to be, but this is just still such a headache and such a disappointment
--------------------------------------------------
basic freshman housing question :D
hey guys. this has definitely been asked 100 times, but i was looking for some advice with dorming. 

i’m an incoming frosh. i visited campus last week and really loved it. went around some of the dorms, and from what it looked like, southwest seemed to be super social. i know it’s the party dorm, etc. but even besides that, the general atmosphere was social. maybe it’s the basketball courts / lawn out front or the dining halls, but it’s just nice to me. i didn’t stay in one of the dorms so i guess i didn’t get the full experience of sw? 

basically, i wanna do well in college. i know that’s pretty subjective and general, but i don’t want a blazing party every night (although i’m guessing that’s an exaggeration of sw) in short, is southwest that “bad”? (noise, continuous parties, distractions, atmosphere) i heard the low rise buildings tend to be less crazy, any truth to that?

my next option would be central. so i was wondering how central stacks up? i’m guessing a little more tame, but is it super quiet and harder to meet people as a freshman? i’d say i’m a pretty social and extroverted person, but i know a distracting environment can make goals less attainable. 

sorry for the long paragraph, i really appreciate anyone who responds. stay safe guys! hope to see you on campus in the fall :D

upperclassmen housing
so here’s my situation: I’m gonna be a junior in the fall but I’m also graduating in that same semester (senior by credits, graduating early, etc. etc.). there’s literally only 5 open spots left for on campus housing and it’s just doubles in cashin. I then started considering off campus housing, but are there any viable options for me if I only need to be in the Amherst area from September-December? Since leases tend to be longer than 4 months and leaving a place while in a joint lease is not ideal??? Also, since I only have classes on Mondays and Wednesdays, I’ve considered driving the two hours to campus and two hours back on both those days just to attend classes, but I feel like that’ll become exhausting. I’ve also heard that more housing spots might open up on campus for upperclassmen. Should I just wait for that?

“Residental Life” Tab missing on my spire account
I am currently a sophomore who just transferred to Umass Amherst (got accepted on the 30th) and am trying to get my housing done. Online it says to fill out the Residence Hall Contract on spire, but the “Residental Life” tab is nowhere to be found for me, is this normal for a transfer/1st year student at Umass? I have a friend who I am trying to room with, but he wasn’t able to find me in the system anywhere, am I not able to room with a returning student because I’m a transfer student? Do I have to go through first-year protocol even though I’m academically a junior?

r/UMass When they find out they have to live in Sylvan

--------------------------------------------------
Thanks UMass :D
Why let the Freshmen pick housing first? It's simple.. In a time where UMass is scrambling to get more money, of course they're going to let the new Freshman pick first. Us older students are less likely to stop now, we've already come this far. UMass needs to secure the new Freshman before anything. Thanks UMass :D

PSA to anyone considering The Boulders
Can't speak to experiences in any other off-campus complexes, but I've lived in The Boulders for five years, and the incompetency of management is *breathtaking*. Almost unbelievably so, and it's gotten progressively worse over the years.

For example, they told me they were going to replace my toilet on a Friday, and that it would take one day. I arrived home at 8PM the preceding *Tuesday* to find ... no functioning toilet, work equipment everywhere, and an unlocked door. No one from the office bothered to tell me in advance so I could make other arrangements for the night.

This is but one of many incidents showcasing their unprofessionalism.

housing for freshman
I'm seeing a ton of posts about housing at UMass filling up, and I haven't even committed to the school yet. Is there guaranteed housing for freshman, and if so will it likely be in Sylvan (apparently the one everyone doesn't want to be in)?
--------------------------------------------------
Do transfers have different housing processes?
I recently got accepted for the fall 2021 semester and after reading about the shit everyone is going through I’m not sure if living on campus is even possible. As a transfer I’ve been kept in the dark about literally everything so I’m confused about whether or not I should look for off-campus housing or stay at UML since there’s no way in hell I’m commuting. I also can’t find much information about it online...

Rising sophomores
Any other rising sophomores who got boned and have no clue what to do for next semester?
--------------------------------------------------
To the Sophomores Complaining About Housing:
Shouldn’t have even gotten first priority (whatever that means) in the first place. And if you’re complaining about Sylvan, think about the juniors and seniors who have a 0% shot of getting anything. Just be happy you got housing on campus to begin with. It sucks but so does everything at this school lately. You never know - living in Sylvan could be what helps you meet your new best friend or something...

Does housing selection happen every semester or every year?
I am a new transfer student and I will be living in Sylvan for Fall 2021. I was wondering if we go through the same process at the end of Fall 2021 for room selection during Spring 2022. Or do we just keep this room for the whole academic year? Also, the payment rates for rooms on the UMass residential life page, are they per semester or per academic year ( will I be paying approx. $ 3,500 for a semester or a year)?

UMass fucked us
I’m a freshman, will be a sophomore next year. I requested my housing appointment within minutes of it opening and the email going out. I logged on to Spire before my time was even started, and was there the moment it did. 

Nothing but some 40 rooms in Sylvan open.

UMass handled this housing situation terribly. I did every fucking single thing right and still got fucked. I feel bad for the other students in my position and in even worse ones. UMass screwed us all, and it is not fair.
--------------------------------------------------
If I have a late fall 2021 room selection(the period that opens next week) should I assume that I’m just fucked and won’t be able to get a room
Title
--------------------------------------------------
Room Selection
I'm pissed. Rising seniors got fucked over in the room selection this year. In all prior years, seniors get the first pick but they decided to change it for this year. I wish I could live off-campus, but I can't afford it due to the pandemic. Does anyone know if there are still openings in the North Apartments? That's what I'm aiming for.

Gap semester
As we all know by now housing isn’t looking good. I’m a rising sophomore seriously considering taking a gap semester as i’ve pretty much lost my whole freshman year and don’t want 3/8 of my college experience to be stuck at home/paying to live somewhere i don’t want to be. If you’ve taken a gap semester let me know how the process went for you and anything i should know in advance (i know i’ll have to reapply, not too too worried about that part). Thanks in advance
--------------------------------------------------
double availability [vent]
not to make another housing post but to take a minute anyways, my roommate and i don’t have an appointment until the 21st but already there’s been trends of people just selecting open doubles even if they don’t have a planned roommate... i can understand not wanting to make the first move if you’re already going random, but this basically cuts almost all the options for people specifically looking for doubles ;;;

as everyone has posted already... it’s a shitshow here. yes, we can hope more rooms open up (and they have been releasing waves) but there’s no info on where or when these rooms open up. we just wanted to spend our last year in ohill again and unless we obsessively try to check throughout selection/swap we have no idea what will happen :(

good luck to everyone with housing though, i know many of us are in the same boat of worry and frustration.

How should I handle getting off-campus housing?
I've pretty much accepted I probably won't get a room. If I do, great, but otherwise I'm planning to just rent a place. Is 'reserving' an apartment for the fall something people can do? I'd rather not pay rent on a place I won't be staying for five months, but I also don't want to let all the housing get snatched up...

Any advice appreciated.

Shoutout to umass for giving me my first and only panic attack in YEARS
I feel so helpless. I can’t breathe. I haven’t cried this hard or loudly in forever. I’m exhausted and can’t stop crying


I have no idea what to do. I don’t know if my room selection even went though. I have no way to check. I didn’t receive an email confirmation. It was just so fast. If I didn’t get the room, I have no idea what to do. Help me

My parents are yelling at me for not trying hard enough. I feel like I lost all control


Update: it didn’t go through. I don’t know what to do

HOUSING IS ALL GONE! ONLY 5 APARTMENTS LEFT!
I am a sophomore this year who transferred last year but decided to stay at home. I have never lived on campus and have not met one person who goes to mass yet (other than over zoom). I should have gotten a higher spot, but there where only 5 rooms left when I chose. Because I almost didn't get a room, I feel like Umass does not care about me at all. I know a lot of you feel the same. This is a terrible handling and mis-consideration by the administration to limit on campus housing.
--------------------------------------------------
How to verify if I picked a room correctly
I picked a room. It’s not what I wanted, but it’s ok I guess. I want to cry. How do I verify that it actually went through?

I'm freaking out right now because of housing.  I'm a rising senior (psych major), I was hoping for a single, but they may not happen.  And my appointment is on the 21.  Should I start looking for off-campus housing, should I wait until Wednesday, or should I be more open for a roommate?

Grayson Hall
What is it like in Grayson socially? I’m hoping to make new friends but I fear I’m not gonna have the chance because ohill has the rep of being more quiet than central (where I’ve previously lived) and southwest. I wanted central but they were essentially all filled when I got my selection and the rooms left were tiny doubles.

Why are there so many spots in Coolidge and Patterson?
Freshman looking for housing. I noticed places like VanWest, Wheeling, Gorman, and other spots were out very early yesterday. It seems like Patterson and Coolidge have a lot of spots for doubles left and I was wondering why. Is there something undesirable about these two places compared to the rest?
--------------------------------------------------
Roommate Picked a Room Without My Opinion
So I hastily made a roommate group with someone... she picked a room without asking me first... Is there ANY way I can leave the group she formed? Can she kick me out? The room she picked is really small and I wanted a different room and we discussed a different room but then when that room got taken she picked a different one without asking me. This sucks.
--------------------------------------------------
Confused about housing
Ok so I picked a room in central today, but they were all going so fast that I just had to pick something. I looked on the map blueprint of the dorms on the umass page and I picked a dorm room that has a male bathroom on that floor. The dorm on it said “open” so anyone can pick it. Does this mean I have to either go up stairs or down stairs to use the female restroom?
--------------------------------------------------
Just realized I picked a room in a DRC I'm not a part of
Hi y'all. While selecting rooms today, I picked a room that I found out later is for a DRC of people I do not identify as a part of. I'm open to diversity and new experiences, but am I even allowed to be in that floor? Will it be exceptionally awkward? Or is it not a big deal.
--------------------------------------------------

Transfer Roommate Not Working
Hey all, to make a long story short, I’m trying to room with my buddy who’s a transferring junior. I’m technically a sophomore bc I took a gap semester. I tried selecting my room today, but despite him having a Spire ID #, he does not show up as someone I can form a roommate group with. Does anybody have any idea how to fix this? I can’t pick a room until it lets me pick him as a roommate, because I’m obviously not trying to go random when I don’t have to. 
Planning on calling residential life tomorrow, any help would be appreciated, thanks.

North Apartments ADA (disability) question
Here's what I know so far: you can pick ADA (Amer w/ Dis Act) apartments without having a disability, but if a disabled person needs an apartment, you'll be asked to move out, which I'd be fine with. But, from what I've read from others, this seems to be a very rare occurrence, as I'm assuming they keep some ADA apartments delisted for such cases.

In any case, ADA apartments (units -04 and -08) and specifically certain rooms (A and B) are bigger than standard apartments (9x9). The square footage of the A room (10.333x12.5) is \~50% larger than a standard room. **My question is what does ADA actually mean? Are the counters lower or something, or is the toilet modified in a significant way? Basically, are there any differences that would be noticeable in any way?**

EDIT: I figured it out. See comment. Unfortunately while writing this the last ADA apartment I wanted got taken >:( so I chose a normal apartment. Oh well, hopefully someone can benefit from this and decide quicker to secure it next time. ;)

Truly solo housing?
Have been looking at housing options all day since my appointment started. I'm looking for a single, but the only available ones left for me are suites and apartments, which is fine. I'm looking though, and the suites are with 8 people and the apartments are with 4. I was leaning toward the North apartments, but was wondering if there are any specific halls that have truly single living, as in not with 3 other people in the same living area. Thanks!

I also saw that there were ADA apartments (disability) which were slightly larger, with you only being required to move out if someone needs it, which I've read is unlikely. Are there any downsides to these apartments like are the tables very low or something for wheelchair access?

Rising Senior Engineering Major Housing Help!
Hello, I am currently a rising senior in the college of engineering at UMass studying computer engineering. The housing situation at this time looks really rough and unpredictable, especially for seniors. I absolutely need to be on campus next academic year because my courses are going to be in-person and I have a senior design project.

Housing
I’m a rising junior and my appointment is on the 20th at like 9:45. I’m more or less just looking for some reassurance or help as there are about 560 rooms left. I know it may just be for today and that more rooms may be available, but it’s making me think a lot about what I’m suppose to do next semester. I don’t know the area as I’ve really only been on campus for 2.5 semesters, and i don’t want to live off campus as I find it much more of a hassle especially now trying to find a place when so many people are looking off campus too. I can’t commute either as I live 2.5 hours away so idk, is there going to be enough rooms come Tuesday?

Question about Baker Hall/roommate sitch
was in Van Meter spring 2021 and kinda had a weird experience but still decided to stay in central & go with Baker for next year. 

Just had my appointment and got a double (dont have a roomie, yet (?)). As we all know the room selection thing has been a cluster fuck with more appointments requested than space available so I’m sure a rando is gonna pick to live with me due to the limited space but I’m just stressed and paranoid about the whole thing now, can anyone offer some encouraging words lmao about baker in general and/or the random roommate situation?

Corner and grass facing rooms
Northeast 

Me and my roommate are in the process of finalizing our favorite dorms. We like corner rooms and ones with windows facing out toward the quad (not road). 

I heard somewhere that corner rooms should be avoided. Why is that?

How can I be sure that a room faces toward the quad? I’m assuming they’re the ones in line with the main entrance (not across). Am I correct?

Apartment search
Hi everyone, my 2 friends and I are looking for a 3br apartment for the coming school year. Do people have recommendations/suggestions for places/where to look?

is umass worth it? transfer student
hi! im gonna be a sophmore soon and i got accepted into umass isenberg. didnt get into the honors program which kinda sucks but oh well. i'm from ct.

i've recently applied to bu, northeastern, and umd college park and am considering all the schools. i'm very indecisive which is why i'd appreciate any honest opinions you could give! i know most of u are probably biased but its worth a shot

i'm currently a marketing major but not 100% sure on my career.

my top school i like is NEU, but i'm worried it will be too no-fun adult-y if that makes sense. also hard to get into.

some big things i'm looking at:

1) social life and community. i NEED a school where i'll make friends, be friendly with lots of people, go to parties, etc. i'm somewhat introverted but once i'm comfortable and not socially anxious, i love to have fun and be super loud
2) diversity. there needs to be a decent amount of diversity: i'm a liberal mexican-american and i don't wanna feel like an outsider
3) dorms. i'd prefer to have a room to myself because i'm that type of person, and nice (close!) dorms are a huge plus, although i know that they're very rare. having my own bathroom would be GREAT instead of a floor one
4) should i be applying to the honors college for better dorms, accomidations, etc? are the normal dorms shitty? is it hard to get into? or is it for non-social ppl lol
5) good academics for future jobs is obviously something to consider. i'm gonna be in the business school 
6) school spirit. huge plus, going to a school like that is always nice. my current doesn't have any and it SUCKS.
7) is there stuff to do on campus? HUGE plus is it's by a city or not in the middle of no where. are there good campus stores, etc?
8) is it safe on/near campus? i'm a woman, so i'm always anxious about safety. it's a hard world for us lol

if u send me a long response i might fall in love w u.

HOUSING FOR SOPHOMORE YEAR

Did you get a housing timeline email?
Hi,
I was wondering if any of you got emails telling you when it would be time to make a housing appointment. I believe that living at UMass normally sends one out, but you may correct me if I'm wrong.

Anyways, I know a lot of people who had no clue that they were supposed to sign up for appointments and got late ones as a result. I wouldn't have known myself had it not been for a discord post.
So did they just not email this year or did only some people get an email / I missed it?

Additionally, do you guys have any idea what I should do since I have an on time housing appointment, but someone I want to room with does not?

Which central dorm is the best?
I’m thinking of moving to Central to meet new people. NE was pretty much a ghost town and very quiet. I’m thinking of Chadbourne, Baker, Brett or Greenough?

I’m not much of a smoker or enjoy the smell of weed, so I don’t know if Central be a good fit? I’m just looking to branch out and meet more talkative people!

quarantine dorms are a false imprisonment waiting to happen
the school is committing a tort by confining students to dorms. 

&#x200B;

by threatening to suspend or expel students for breaking quarantine is the definition of false imprisonment.

I know we all hate on well-being Wednesday but I had literally no idea that it was today so I got ready to go to campus for my lab only for my roommate to tell me that there was no lab ? !

Greetings Reddit. Long story short, I tried individual sessions through CCPH after recommendation by a professor I’m really close to. The therapist I had didn’t really help me.

Chances of Getting CHCRC Apartments
I am a rising sophomore in honors and was hoping to get a place in the honors apartments because I was hoping to have a kitchen but I wanted to live on campus. In the email I just got, it said "Please note that Apartment spaces in CHCRC have been held to support Junior and Senior students.  Any unselected apartment spaces will be added to your CHCRC appointment on Wednesday, April 21st by 3:00pm". 

Do I have any shot of getting one of the apartments or are they quite competitive?

Summer housing
Hi guys. I was looking for some advice.

UMass appears to offer summer housing for students who need it and also students who are employed by the university and must be on site. I'll be employed by UMass this summer so I believe I apply.

My problem is that we're supposed to prioritize which kind of housing we want on the application, and we won't know what we're assigned until "May 10th at the latest," which is WAYYYY too late to explore other options. I absolutely need a single. 

On the other hand, I'm having an incredibly hard time finding studio and single bedroom apartments for a low enough price. I only need to live here for the fall and summer, and barely anywhere is willing to lease for less than 10 months. Puffton is cheap, but all the reviews are horror stories.

&#x200B;

Any advice?

Does anyone else have an exam scheduled for this Thursday?
Hey y’all, just tryna see if anyone else’s professors have scheduled an exam for this Thursday. In my Journalism & Law class we have one in 2 days. It seems a bit cheap to schedule it the day after our Wellness Wednesday. I was actually really looking forward to having a day off because without spring break the burnout has been really bad.

Is anyone else experiencing something similar?

CS Grad Courses and Plans
Hi all, I'm admitted into the MSCS graduate program in Data Science for fall 21. I'm here to seek advice on my grad life.

1. **CS COURSES RECOMMENDATION:** First of all, is there any advice on courses to take? I'm more interested in ML courses.
2. **4th Semester:** I'm so troubled about the fourth semester as I really don't know staying on campus for only one course would be worth it. Could it be possible if I just graduate one semester earlier? Like, is it really that hard to have one semester taking one more course than suggested?
3. **HOUSING:** I plan to rent the One East Pleasant studio for 3 semesters but I will have to relet my apartment for the last semester. Is it hard to relet studio in springs? ( I don't have a car so I prefer to live in town. And I have two cats so shared apartments in town are too small for them. Thus the studio is my best choice of housing.)
--------------------------------------------------

Mark my fucking words
There’s not gonna be another spike in cases and no one’s gonna die. Everyone has pretty much already had covid, and even if they didn’t, they’ll be a little sick for a couple of days.
There is not a single student on campus capable of dying from covid. You guys need to get back on your anti-anxiety meds or smoke some weed or whatever it’ll take for you to calm down.
--------------------------------------------------
Informal Financial Aid Appeal?
UMass Amherst is my top choice, but at $42,000 after a financial aid award of $12,000/yr merit scholarship, it still is much more expensive than my other options. At the end of the four years, UMass will come out to be about $25,000 more than the other schools. 

I know the merit award is non-negotiable, but would I have luck appealing and possibly receiving a grant? Additionally, how would I go about appealing? I do not have any special circumstances that would allow me to fill out one of the Appeal Forms - would I be okay informally emailing the financial aid office and explaining that UMass is my top choice, but it is less affordable, and if they gave a little bit more aid, such as a modest grant, I would likely attend?

Edit: Unfortunately, they said no

New grad student looking for housing
Hi everyone,

I'm an incoming graduate student who is looking for housing in the area with other graduate students.

**About me:** I'm 27, male, studious but very social. I'm a vegetarian leftist nerd who will be entering the mathematics department, but I enjoy all academic subjects and arts. I'm kinda queer, but it's complicated. I have a plethora of hobbies, most notably photography, listening to and playing music, and travelling. I like boardgame nights, dinner parties, and watching movies with friends. I enjoy a reasonably clean living space. I try my best to be communicative and very respectful of others and their boundaries and appreciate roommates who are the same. I do not smoke or do drugs.

**About you all:** Ideally, I'm looking to live with 2 to 4 charismatic graduate students of any genders who want a social and friendly living situation. Nerds and geeks who like talking about their academics or hobbies are a huge plus. I tend to mesh best with queer folks, artists, musicians, scientists, and outdoorsy folks. LGBTQ+ friendly is a must, and ideally everyone is decently clean and communicative.

**Dealbreakers:** Conservative politics, heavy substance usage (especially weed), messy.

**About the house/room:** I'd like to fill a room in an house off campus with continuing students who have an existing social dynamic. Ideally we host small parties or boardgame nights with our friends once in a while. Would be great if someone has a cat or dog. I'm flexible on budget for the right fit. Ideally I'll be moving in mid to late July, but I'm flexible on this as well.

&#x200B;

Send me a message if this sounds compatible and we can chat more. Also, tips on other avenues to find housing in the area would be appreciated. Thanks!

Looking for a roommate
Hi y’all! I’m Zoe! (she/her) I just found out that the girl I was planning on dorming with next semester is gonna be an RA in Southwest. We had planned to dorm in Northeast in Thatcher, Lewis, or Johnson. I’m an animal science major, planning to switch to pre-vet, and a rising sophomore. I don’t really have any pet peeves but I would prefer someone who is organized and respects boundaries when it comes to personal belongings, not that agreements can’t be made. If you’re interested just let me know!
--------------------------------------------------
TL;DR: I’m sad, I’m stressed, I’m angry. Another post from a suffering UMass student
I’m literally taking THIRTEEN (13) credits and I want to absolutely fucking die. This is my last semester and I never anticipated being this miserable and stressed; not by a long shot. I’ve been doing homework all week and I had an exam TODAY and I have an exam TOMORROW and I have 8,000 things due and this is mostly JUST FROM TWO CLASSES which are SEVEN CREDITS TOTAL?!!!!  and I also am trying to apply to jobs and I feel like I’m too late in doing that and I can’t have a second to catch my fucking breath!!!!  

I’m fully vaccinated against Covid, but the last time I saw any friends was three weeks ago because I don’t even have an hour or two to spare to socialize anymore. One of my friends has straight up ghosted me because I never initiated hanging out and she was angry and thought it was because I didn’t want to be her friend. Wouldn’t understand that if I can find 15-30 minutes to spend watching TV or have any alone time to unwind so I can not go insane, I need to spend it on myself. It’s so infuriating that I’m so bogged down with work (with technically, the lowest credit load I’ve ever had in my entire college career BY A LOT) that it’s affecting my relationships with the people I care about. 

when I DO have time to do shit, it’s 1) going to be spent on either doing homework or exercising in some way and 2) so so fucking hard to concentrate and put in effort because I’m so burnt out- therefore, everything takes me even longer to do. I did not realize just how badly I needed spring break. I needed it so I could maybe finally get some sleep, and I especially needed it to get my resume/cover letters sent out to jobs and apply. It took me three fucking weeks to rewrite my resume because I never had enough time to sit down with it and just do it because I have hours and hours of work to do every single day. 

Literally fuck UMass. I know this place doesn’t care about me and we been knew, but I’m just so overwhelmed and I need all the shit to stop pls UMass is lucky the library is mostly closed bc if it weren’t I would have jumped off the roof by now.

Where to house in the fall
Hey all! I’ll be attending UMASS in the fall as a freshman, and I’m trying to decide on where to live. I’m between southwest and central. I like southwest because I’m super social, like dr*nking and originally wanted to go to school in a big city, but I’m a bio major and will likely be studying a lot (I think?) so I’m afraid being there might hinder that (noise, distractions etc.) I like central bc it’s closer to the science classes and seems a bit more chill, but I’m worried I’ll miss out on the fun. I’ve already found a roommate, and she seems fine with either. Any thoughts on what I should choose?

Prince Hall vs. Brett Hall vs. North Apartments?
Hey y'all! I'm trying to decide where I should dorm this fall and I could really use the opinions of those who have lived on campus.

I know SW is known to be pretty rowdy but is Prince that way as well? I know a lot of international students and athletes live there because of the break-housing but is the atmosphere in Prince the same as high rises or quieter? I know SW is also known for drinkers, but can't all that be avoided if you really want to avoid it? I like the idea of living in Prince since it is closer to the library and my classes, but it is also closest to Hamp (it seems like it's the best dining hall on campus). Also, I like the idea of living there because the room I want is south facing and would get sunlight lol.

I also like Brett because the building honestly has really pretty windows and is close to the Student health center/hospital. However, isn't Central known to have a lot of smokers? Is it really that bad, or are people just blowing it out of proportion? Is it worth living in Brett for the calm atmosphere even though it's a bit further from the library and rec center? Plus isn't Frank like the worst dining hall on campus? I also like that the singles are rather large too.

I don't really know much about North apartments, but I don't really like how it's kind of far away from things. It's definitely not as far as Sylvan, but it seems like having to walk that far to classes and stuff during the colder months wouldn't be ideal. I'm not too worried about getting bad roommates or anything but is the distance to the dining hall and other buildings that bad?

I'd really appreciate anyone's input! I obviously didn't say everything that's on my mind about choosing a place to live, but hopefully this gives you an idea of where my mind is at :)

Any Chinese Majors who have studied abroad?
How was your experience? The department only accepts 6 credits of Chinese courses from outside UMass. I dream of studying Chinese abroad but what’s the point in doing it is the school won’t even accept half of my program credits?

To all Honors College Students
Hey,
If you’re a guy in the honors college and plan to room in the honors college halls in Fall 2021, please feel free reach out to me. Especially if you’re planning on rooming as a random roommate, I think that we could just room together. 
I’m a CS Major, and I want to room in the Honors College building in the Fall 2021 semester and I’m looking roommates. I’m really friendly so feel free to hmu and we could text/facetime or something. I want to live in a suite, but let me know if you need a double roommate because I’m on the fence for either. I know that housing options are about to open up, so let me know as soon as possible and we can talk. 

Also, in case you’re wondering, I’m:
- A clean person
- A Covid-safe person
- I will be fully vaccinated by next month
- Super chill
- Quite extroverted

Please feel free to reach out!

Looking For Guidance
Hello, I’m currently a first year student who’s been on the exploratory track for comp sci. I decided that I wasn’t really too big on it so I decided to switch to an engineering major. I’ve been eyeballing the biomedical engineering track for some time now and have had a great passion towards the work. Although, my experience with biology and chemistry is not too great. I’ve taken an AP bio course along with an honors chem course during my high school years but don’t remember much. I do enjoy physics and math and have been up to date with it during my year in college. I read that a good option is to become a mechanical engineer, receive your bachelors, and then pursue a masters in biomedical engineering. Would this be a better approach or would it make more sense to just go straight into biomedical?

Room Selection Question On Spire
Hello everyone I have a question regarding housing. As a rising senior, on campus housing for me this fall is going to be rough since seniors are last of the priority list. I am trying to find housing, but with my shitty ass priory number of being in the 3000s it’s near impossible. I looked on spire on the Room Selection Home under Selection Opportunities Remaining that I have a zero. Does this mean that I can’t get housing this fall? Can someone please clarify this for me?

Just Feeling Bad
I honestly feel like shit right now and I know everyone is too. Like every professor, student, and faculty member just seems like they're going through it. I am even experiencing a medical emergency on top of just this semester sucking, and it's like I feel so *guilty* using my accommodations because everything just sucks for everyone.

I am really hating college right now but at least there's only one month left.

Edit: Wow this got more traction than I expected 😅 I actually made this post because a professor sent me an email that made me cry. Kind of embarrassing really.

Semester abroad programs?
Are semester abroad programs expected to be a thing next semester? If so, how do I apply for one? Am I too late in the process at this point? I don't really know how anything works in regards to applications/deadlines or how approval works and would appreciate any information. I'd ideally like my semester abroad to be in Israel in case that's relevant. Thanks!

math 132 after just taking math 127
I am switching into engineering and I have the option to jump to math 132, where if I get a B or higher the requirement for math 131 is waived. However, I have only taken math 127 before this. Is taking math 132 without 131 realistically something you would recommend, or is math 132 much more challenging without taking math 131 prior to it?

Summer Spanish
Hi yall. Im not currently a student at umass, but I am trying to take a Spanish class here over the summer to get my requirement out of the way. Has anyone taken Danielle Thomas's Spanish classes? I'm trying to find out if she is any good or terrible before I sign up. Thanks!

Petition to Change the Room Selection Priority for Singles (Juniors and Seniors first)
Petition here: [http://chng.it/kRpTkkC2jj](http://chng.it/kRpTkkC2jj)

Anyone else think it's stupid that rising Freshman and Sophomores get priority for ALL housing? I understand the logic "well they haven't had any time on campus". Fine, give them priority for doubles and triples. But come on, singles too? I'm a rising Junior, and I was looking forward to being high enough on the priority ladder to get a single -- I just barely missed getting one last semester. How is it fair that someone that's been here 0-1 years gets priority?

I understand that this sucks for all parties involved: Freshmen are supposed to be housed on-campus, and Sophomores haven't even had a chance to live on-campus. This is just about singles however, which only account for about 14% of all on-campus housing slots. 

Here's what I'm asking: Give rising Sophomores and Freshman priority for doubles and triples, but not singles. Start with rising Juniors and Seniors getting priority for singles, then open them up to Freshmen and Sophomores. At the very least, let the people who have committed to the school for 2+ years get a chance to have singles.

Umass Nursing

Color printing at the library/anywhere else
I don’t have a printer and I have to print out many pages in color, and was wondering if the printing stations are open in Dubois now that they’re opened some study spaces? 

Also on that note, it’s beyond dumb that only 2 floors are open there especially if the goal is to minimize contact and maximize social distancing. I just want to use the computers to do my homework on the 3rd floor man :( I miss my study set up so much

Does anyone meet up in some way to study for ECON 104?
Hi, I'm currently in ECON 104 with Patrick Dolenc. I didn't do too well on the first Exam and I'm waiting for the results of my second one. Does anyone meet up in Groupme or a group text message or by some other way to study? While I feel like the book helps, the lectures are still pretty hard to follow and I'm genuinely feeling scared about the Final Exam. Also, I've been going to the study sessions but they haven't really been helping in terms of understanding the material.

CICS Overload
I'm currently thinking about taking 21 credits for Fall 2021, and I was looking at the course overload form. One of the boxes on the form is "Have you discussed this with your academic advisor?". Do you know if I have to meet with my advisor before submitting the form or even after to get my form accepted? Also, do you know if they accept most request or if they are stingy on that?

HS senior here - considering going to UMass out of state for CS
Hi, so I'm here because I've gotten all of my college decisions and I narrowed my choices down to between UConn (in state) vs UMass Amherst. As a decided Computer Science major, if financials didn't matter I would pick UMass for their superior CS program.

I wouldn't have to take out loans for UConn, but for UMass I'd need to get \~$4k per year in loans.

My question is, is it worth it in terms of job prospects or quality of education to pay the extra for UMass? I know answers might be a bit biased coming from here but I wanted to gauge some opinions.

Where to see pics of rooms?
Hi all, 

IIRC UMass had a site where you could see each type of room in a residential area in a 360° view. Unfortunately, it seems like that sites deleted because it relied on Adobe Flash. Does anybody know where I could find pictures of the rooms? 

I’m thinking of switching from Southwest to Central and am hoping to get a general idea on where to live. 

Apologies for this small question, if there was a housing megathread I would definitely post it there.

Cheers.
