Research, generally
How easy is it to get involved in bio/neuro research? Not just in the summer, but in the fall or spring? Are there enough RA positions to go around? I'm currently a rising sophomore, do you have any advice?

MS Spring/Fall Admissions
Thinking about applying for MS CS but can't decide whether I should apply for the Spring or Fall semester. Anyone have an insight about the pros/cons of each sem? Will I get the same aid? Is there more people applying for the Fall than the Spring? Any insight/advice will help, thank you!
--------------------------------------------------
SSOL: max number of credits registered at once?
so I'm currently enrolled in 21 for the fall and im sitting on some waitlists. if the waitlists go through, will that push me up to 24, 27, etc.? or will i eventually hit a cap which effectively stops any of my waitlists from going through until i drop a course? (i realize this is oddly specific but maybe someone has had the same experience before)

What is the CVN Master's in CS Online Program like?

Update to ‚ÄúAbout to graduate, likely failing a class‚Äù
...Or whatever I called it. 

I passed with a C (took it pass/d/fail thankfully)!!!!! I didn‚Äôt email the professor because he had made it clear he didn‚Äôt want to be emailed about grades and wouldn‚Äôt let me do extra work. 

Like I said in the last post, I was somewhere around the 10th percentile of the class so I guess that‚Äôs what saved me. 

Thank you to everyone who answered my questions. It was a very stressful week and definitely made an already underwhelming graduation experience worse, but at least I‚Äôm done!!!

How doable is two summer classes (Summer A)?
Intro to Stats and Cognitive Neuroscience are the two courses.

I didn‚Äôt even realize the summer session started on Monday. I literally just turned in a final yesterday. Has anyone done two summer classes and remained sane (i.e go out and see friends occasionally)? I have no other responsibilities other than the two classes. I should be fine, right?

How long into the summer can you choose to uncover a spring P grade?
I can't uncover a P from fall anymore, but I'm wondering if that's because we've ended spring or if that happened a while ago. If I can choose to wait to uncover my spring grade until summer grades that'd be ideal but I don't want to wait too long and not have the option

Does anybody know anything about Columbia NY/Paris Porgram and if its worth it? Especially for a student at a Liberal Arts college thinking about doing this.
The Shape of Two Cities: New York/Paris Program is for undergraduate students and recent graduates from colleges and universities around the country. The program‚Äôs goals are to introduce the fields of architecture, planning and preservation; encourage their exploration in the contexts of history, theory and practice; and identify and analyze their interrelationships, especially in regard to the making of cities. The in-depth course of study is suited to students without previous academic experience in design who are interested in architecture, planning or preservation as a career, students in the liberal arts who are interested in approaching urban and historical issues from an architectural and urban planning perspective, and students with previous design experience who would like to develop additional studio skills in preparation for application to graduate school.

Directed by the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation of 
Columbia University, the program offers a two-semester cirriculum whose
intention is to immerse participants in the rich physical and intellectual urban 
environments of New York and Paris. Instruction draws on the resources of 
Columbia University and its faculty and the architectural communities of 
New York and Paris.

which internship do I go forward with?
Hey friends, 

I am so lucky to have a few options for the summer, and would like some advice on which of the two internships I‚Äôve narrowed down to to go forward with. 

To provide some background, I‚Äôm a chemistry undergraduate (class of 2022) who was recently accepted into a 4+1 express masters chemical engineering program (originally planned to start fall 2022) at Columbia university. However, I‚Äôm changing that to a 3+1 more or less. I‚Äôm going into my fourth undergraduate year but because I‚Äôve completed all my requirements, I‚Äôve started my masters requirements with the hopes of using my undergrad financial aid to complete my masters during my fourth undergraduate year. 

Just yesterday morning, I was offered a business intelligence internship with a fertility benefits management company. As part of this role, I would get the opportunity to learn and work with SQL, Python, and dashboarding tools such as Cognos, and Power BI for data analysis. I was told that the pay would be $40/hr bc I‚Äôm a masters student, but was later told that the executives decided to go with the undergraduate pay of $20/hr for all interns. That was a bummer... I‚Äôd have the option to work remotely or in-person. I plan on working in industry post-graduation and because my resume is currently severely lacking in professional experience, I think I‚Äôd gain a lot out of this internship. 

With that being said, I also have the opportunity to intern with a mass transfer systems company. To my understanding, my main role would consist of fact-checking technical information on their new website. Although I‚Äôm not particularly excited about separations processes ‚Äî not yet, at least‚Äî I like that it‚Äôs very chemEng related, local to my hometown, and I‚Äôd probably get to learn and work with various different projects if I asked. This would also be a great opportunity for me to see what a purely chemEng role looks like, and again help me build my resume. 

I‚Äôm currently leaning towards the first option bc it would be unlike any experience I‚Äôve had. I‚Äôm also thinking that I can secure a chemEng job after masters graduation, so gaining experience in another field from which I van also gain programming and dashboarding skills sounds appealing to me. I‚Äôm not sure what the pay would be, but I‚Äôd think between $15-20. 

With that being said, I‚Äôd love to receive any feedback or guidance. I hope I was clear enough and that this post hasn‚Äôt been too long. Thanks a bunch in advance!

Incoming Freshman: SEAS to CC Economics
Hey everyone, I recently committed to Columbia and am a prospective undergraduate Operations Research major at SEAS. At the time of application, I was set on pursuing Quant Finance after college, but my interests have shifted greatly during my senior year, with my interests now leaning towards the more social / fast-paced and less technical jobs on Wall Street (e.g. PE, VC).

Thus, I'm considering switching from Operations Research to Economics or Financial Economics. Another reason for this move is that I'm worried about the difficulty of the OR major and SEAS in general (I've never been a fan of physics or chemistry and would like more flexibility to pursue electives, as well as time to network and pursue internships during the school year).

With that said, is it possible to switch from SEAS to CC before starting my first semester? and if not, could I switch before my second semester? I'd appreciate any help! Thanks!

What kind of companies recruit for CS at Columbia's career fairs?

I haven't P/D/F-ed in the past so I'm not sure what to look for on SSOL or some other portal, but it doesn't look like anything has changed.  Also, my advisor hasn't been the most responsive with my emails, and I've emailed her in the past with about a 20% response rate.  (I get that the CSA advisors are busy, especially with the amount of P/D/F emails they received this year.)  Anyone know how to confirm whether or not the request was processed?

How to join a sports team at Columbia?
I didn't join Columbia as a Student-Athlete but I used to compete as a part of my city's rowing team while in high school.

How does a student join a sports team at Columbia? I really miss training with other people and it really helped me push myself. I'd like to join a sports team at Columbia next semester(Tennis or Rowing ideally).  I imagined there being an intense selection process for making it to the team but someone told me that "anyone" at Columbia is allowed to join a team.

Would really appreciate it if I can get some guidance about the process.

In any case for those wondering I have a 4.07 GPA and got Magna Cum Laude. Love this school dearly but grade inflation here is out of control lol. TBH I don't think it was possible for me to get a higher GPA since not all classes even give out A+ grades. Latin honors are wack

If anyone also has recommendations for nearby gyms that might suit those sports better, please let me know! Thank you.

Deeply Troubling Comments by Barnard's Ben Philippe

I just came across this interview by Barnard Professor Ben Philippe where he discusses his "logical conclusion" to a "supposed" race war,

Talking to a ***Jewish*** woman, Ben describes his fantasy, "I'll smile as we raise glasses to your good white health, while the detonator blinks under the table, knowing the exits are locked and the air vents filled with gas." 

Needless to say, these are abhorrent comments no matter the context. I will be following up with administration on this.

MFA Writing Program Funding?
Just wondering if anyone had any insider scoop on what the program usually offers in the way of scholarships. From what I‚Äôve seen online at grad cafe and elsewhere, the levels of distribution seem to be: nada, 10k per year, 20k per year, 25k per year, and rarely 30k per year. They allegedly don‚Äôt fully-fund anyone but there‚Äôs been some skepticism about that. Is there really a shroud of literary secrecy?

Am I allowed to commute during my first year instead of dorming?
I live about an hour away from Columbia's campus (I would have to take the LIRR and then transfer to the 1 train). Would it be (1) possible and (2) reasonable for me to commute instead of dorming?

My cost of attendance is extremely high (50-60k+), so I was thinking that I could maybe save some money on room and board by commuting. But I'm worried that I might miss out on the full college experience.

Looking for someone to visit student housing for me
Hi I am an incoming grad student and I'm super excited to be starting at Columbia this fall! Today, I did a housing selection online and was matched to a university-owned apartment and now I have two days to confirm and submit my deposit to Columbia. However, there were no pictures or a floor plan, so I'm feeling a little uneasy about committing just yet. The housing portal does give me the option to book a visit, but unfortunately I'm not in New York yet so I can't go personally and they also don't provide the option to visit via Zoom. They do allow someone to visit on my behalf, though. So I'm wondering, would anyone be willing to visit for me and take a video/pictures of the place? I'd really appreciate it and I'd be happy to Venmo you some money for it or buy you an Amazon gift card or something.
--------------------------------------------------
Can anybody else just not see the Summer Occupancy agreement.
I don't know If I am looking at the wrong thing in the housing portal or if it is just not there but I can not see the occupancy agreement. (I already went emailed called/housing they said some others were also "having trouble" wtfskfs;lag'jag)

MS/PhD in biomedical engineering
I had applied for the MS/PhD track in BME. However, I received an email that they would like to consider me for MS-only option and will have to submit a video interview. Can someone tell me what the video interview entails or how difficult will it be? I‚Äôm very nervous about it. Another thing that I wanted to know is are there any opportunities for financial aid? Thank you

Do international students have international advisors
Im an incoming freshman who‚Äôs also an international student and honestly I‚Äôm stuck on the visa application process.. I have emailed ISSO but I was wondering if there was a way I could get to talk to someone directly because maybe they‚Äôll offer more beneficial help for someone in my situation.

Thanks!

Housing Group Transfer
Hi everybody,

I will be a graduate student at Columbia in the fall and I was wondering if anybody here has had experience with doing a group transfer for on-campus housing (or if you could share your apartment share experience that would be great too!)

I would like to live with my friend (who is currently a grad student at Columbia living in on-campus housing).  I participated in my housing selection today and ended up picking an apartment.  I have been in touch with residential services and they told me that you can't do a group transfer until you're both moved in.
--------------------------------------------------
Is anyone still waiting to hear back from Columbia's MS CS program???
I applied to Columbia's Computer Science Master back in January (before the first priority Jan 15th deadline). As of today it has been 4.5 months and still no status update from the program. I sent the admissions team an email but got an auto-generated email saying that they are not responding to inquiries regarding application status.

&#x200B;

Just wondering if anyone else is on the same boat? Honestly not having much hope at this point since it has been nearly 5 months. (I did get into another prestigious program for CS though)
--------------------------------------------------
prospective student, need avice
hi everyone! so i was accepted to barnard (i know its not columbia but barnard subreddit is dead) this past march and its always been my dream school, however ive been wrestling with going there and staying in state (florida) and going to UF. basically my reasoning is that UF gave me a $10k/yr scholarship in addition to having my tuition fully covered so i‚Äôd be saving so much money, and finances is my top priority as my family isn‚Äôt well off. barnard gave me good aid, although i‚Äôd still have to take out loans to go. i only have a few days left and haven‚Äôt been able to make up my mind so i wanted to come on here and ask the subreddit a few questions.

is balancing a part-time job (~15 hours) and the barnard academic curriculum doable? i‚Äôd have to work at a duane reade because i currently work in the walgreens pharmacy and would transfer. (i have to pay at least half my cost of attendance, my parents will do other half)

is getting into clubs and ECs as difficult as it seems? i feel like its so competitive. i also feel like my experience with leadership and other stuff is not even half as extensive as other people who were accepted. my resume is probably 1/4 the length of theirs and im stressed i wont be able to get any internships or jobs because im not as good as the people around me? maybe its just my imposters syndrome #Lol

does financial aid change every year? another thing that keeps me from going to barnard is that my fin aid might change next year because my parents made more (though it went mostly to medical expenses).

 how competitive is the culture there? i know its mostly a personal problem, but i struggle a lotüíØ with comparing myself and i just want to know if my peers are gonna contribute to that.  

can anyone who came from out of state explain how well they adjusted? im coming from a rural area in FL and nyc is gonna be a huge change, though itd be exciting im afraid ill get overwhelmed. 

may ask u more questions if you answer lol.
--------------------------------------------------
Do you recommend taking OS with Jae?
I‚Äôm really interested in the material and enjoyed AP a lot! But I‚Äôve read on culpa reviews about the course having an insane workload, with labs taking over 30 hours each, and people feeling lost on what to do. 

Do you recommend the class? I would be taking it first semester of senior year, and although the material sounds fascinating, I‚Äôm afraid the workload would be too hard to balance along with searching for a full time job during the fall. Is it better to just skip taking the class and self-learn the material instead?
--------------------------------------------------
Looking for Books
I am currently enrolled to take Environmental Bio I and Gen Chem I in the fall, but can't find the textbooks in the CU bookstore yet. Would appreciate hearing which books were used for these classes previously!
--------------------------------------------------
Graduating senior, most likely failed a course.
Hi guys. I‚Äôm in GS, supposed to be graduating. I have had a really bad semester but was able to do well in most of my classes, but knew I wasn‚Äôt doing well in a class so I took it Pdf. It was a major requirement for me. Professor told me I needed 30 on the final to pass the class and I got a 28. He said he can‚Äôt answer questions about grades until they put the grades out so I haven‚Äôt emailed him. Other people did worse than me (around 10% of the class) so maybe the curve will work in my favor but I‚Äôm not sure. 

Wtf do I do? Obviously talk to my advisor. But do I get to retake it in the summer and have it replace the failing grade? Can I take it for free because of the COVID free summer class? The sections are all full for the summer, should I get on the waitlist now? Do I get to still have my slide in the graduation thing?

I don‚Äôt feel like this is the end of the world but I‚Äôm stressing about the details and would love to hear from someone who had something similar happen or literally anyone who has failed a course.
--------------------------------------------------
Columbia MPH Advice
Really looking for advice on applying to Columbia's MPH program in epidemiology but I do not know if I have enough experiences on my resume to get in. I am a high school/university student at a special program in my state. I will be graduating high school in a few weeks and will be applying to Columbia later this year at 18. So far I have a 3.98 gpa, doing biochemistry research in a lab on campus, on the eboard for a club, in 1 honor society, and about 3 volunteer experiences that I have been doing consistently (except for a covid break). I plan to take my MCAT this summer to use that in place of the GRE. Does anyone have any advice on anything that I am lacking or is in the program with any knowledge of the admissions process? Please!!!
--------------------------------------------------
Course Syllabus or Deck Resources?
Hey Columbia!   


Am transferring to columbia this upcoming year. Hoping to prepare for my upcoming classes in Physics, for PHYSUN2601 and PHYS 3007. 

The uni that I came from has a site that has detailed syllabi listed for each class, including explanations of the outcome of the course, books that the class will be based on, and general emphasis on skills it aims to impart. 

I wonder if there's something similar for Columbia? Better yet, if there's a site for previous slides and assignments used by previous classes. 

Cheers!
--------------------------------------------------
Waiving required courses or transferring a course
It says syllabus/course description is required.

Does anyone have first hand knowledge of the process? Are they lax about waiving core requirements or approving the transfer if equivalent course is taken at different university(CVN)?

Incoming Masters Industrial Engineering Student! Any recommendations for classes to take???

Advice and recommendations on off-campus housing
Hi folks!

I'm looking for off-campus housing around Columbia with an August start date, and am wondering if anyone is willing to share info on apartment buildings they've had a good experience with, or have heard good things about? I'm looking for a place that's safe and close to the main campus. 

Location-wise, I would like to stay below the 120th Street, and be within 15-20 minute walking-distance to the main campus (not considering public transportation at the moment). 

Budget-wise, I'm hoping to keep it below $2,500 per month for a studio or 1b1b. 

Thank you guys so much in advance!

Other summer funding apart from CCE and URF
Hi,
I was wondering if anyone here knows of other funding programs someone could apply for apart from CCE or URF. I‚Äôm trying to find grants to fund my summer medical internship program at mailman school of public health at Columbia. I didn‚Äôt get the summer grant for URF that I applied for and I  currently trying to find another. I know it might be too late, but I‚Äôll appreciate if anyone know of any program that is still open!
Thank you

Will you graduate on time if you take four classes per semester (engineering major)?
People say the stress is unbearable, but I hear many take six classes per semester. If I stick with four classes per semester, will I graduate in time?

What are the disadvantages of taking four classes? Is the Core + major too much or is it just the competition that motivates people to take more than four classes?
--------------------------------------------------
MSW Program
Hi everyone! I am considering applying for the MSW program (to attend in fall 2022) and I was hoping I could get some honest feedback on the experience you've had, whether you were able to gain connections that furthered your career post-degree, quality of the content of the education was, opportunities for field work, etc. My biggest concern is primarily the price tag and whether you thought the program was worth it. 

For context: I've worked in a variety of human services/nonprofit positions (including currently at a food bank) and I have a bachelor's in theatre (lol I know). I would also be moving from Nebraska, so out-of-state tuition. 

Any advice or thoughts you have to offer is very appreciated!

How are the gyms and fitness centers near Columbia?
How's Dodge Fitness Center? I've heard it's bearable in the early mornings but still not that great. Are the nearby Planet Fitness and Blink Fitness better options?

Also, is the small gym in the basement of Carmen any good? If so, I might consider Carmen over John Jay. Looking for a place where I can at least get some cardio done (preferably weights too) in the morning.

Columbia GS - Low GPA. 7 years of decent work experience, Great LORs. Do I stand a chance?
Guys- I have a bachelors degree in accounting and after working in accounting and finance for 7 years, I decided I wanted something else from my life and I wanted to pursue psychology. Do I stand a chance? My GPA was really low but it showcases an upward trend and my final grade is A (we have a different grading system than the US one). I have a few Bs and As in my transcript. In my last semester I was able to pull myself together and get an A plus in the final semester. So all in all it has been an upward trend. I have worked in Accounting and Finance for 7 years and I have great LORs and I have written a good SOP explaining my reasons for pursuing psychology(I want to become a psychologist and work in Mental Health Counselling in the future) I did confirm with the university and they said they do accept people coming in for second bachelors when they wanna change fields. I have some social work and Volunteering work on my resume too. I was consistently promoted and I was Employee of the year for 4 out of 7 years. 
I am an international student. 
Do I stand a chance or am I just kidding myself?
--------------------------------------------------
Cheap Housing Reasonably Nearby
So I want to live by myself during school, and I heard rents have been cheaper recently. Does anyone have a good tip on which neighborhoods to focus on if I want to live in my own studio? 

By cheap I mean under $1,500.

How's Harlem? Maybe it's also worth looking at parts of NJ even?
--------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm skeptical of TC Columbia being a cash cow program but what amount would you say is worth the loans to take out for grad school vs undergrad? Which level of degree would be considered more valuable as an Ivy?
Besides the fact that undergrad gets more money in scholarships, how much is undergrad degree from Columbia worth? What‚Äôs the max amount of loans that‚Äôs worth taking out for Columbia College for those that don‚Äôt receive a full ride?


What I don‚Äôt get is wouldn‚Äôt it be a more valuable degree on a masters level? hypothetically: let‚Äôs say, the student graduates from Columbia as an undergraduate. Then, they continue to getting their masters for the career field they want but the graduate school (Ivy or private) offers a limited amount of financial aid provided, which would mean taking out more loans so the student ends up at a state/city university instead to finish their master degree due to funds. So what‚Äôs the difference between someone that starts at a state/city college and ends up at Columbia for graduate school (since ppl label this more to being a cash cow program) or would Colombia College undergrads inevitably end up at a ‚Äúcash cow‚Äù program? 

Or did y‚Äôall get financial funds for grad school because I haven‚Äôt found one person to get much for Columbia‚Äôs grad programs? I‚Äôm genuinely curious because don‚Äôt know much people that went to Columbia as undergrad but I know we all dreamt of it! Also, didn‚Äôt mean to throw in so many questions but it was more like a snowball effect haha

What exactly is Phi Beta Kappa??
International student here, I still don't understand what Phi Beta Kappa exactly is. And I'm afraid it's too late to ask now. For the longest time, I just thought it was some kinda Frat. 

What does it mean to get inducted into it? What are the requirements and benefits?   
Does every University have its Phi Beta Kappa inductees? And who selects them.

Picking electives for Masters
Hey, I would be starting my Masters at Columbia the coming Fall. I am just curious on how the picking up of electives works here.

Any help here would be appreciated, Thanks.

what are y'alls experiences with scholarship displacement?
if i get a 20k scholarship and my efc is 40k, will that money go to helping my family foot the 40k bill (after it helps pay for student work study) or will columbia just use the money to reduce the grant aid they give? and if it just reduces the grant they give, are there any ways to bypass this?

What is the best first-year meal plan?
I'm deciding between Plan 1 (19 swipes/week, 75 dining dollars/term) and Plan 2 (15 swipes/week, 125 dining dollars/term). From what I've heard, most people say that Plan 2 is the way to go, but I'm still not completely sure since I usually eat 3 meals a day (and I'm worried that 15 won't be enough to last me a week, even if I go off-campus for some meals). Is the 50 extra dining dollars/term in Plan 2 worth losing 4 swipes/week?

I‚Äôm planning on committing to Columbia next week. What should I know about Columbia? About GS? What do you wish you knew?
Hi! 

I‚Äôm planning on committing to Columbia (GS/JTS) next week.

What do you wish you‚Äôd known when you first came to Columbia? Were there any significant surprises for you over the years? What do students do for fun? 

I‚Äôve done a lot of research on the Core these past few weeks, admittedly, but I‚Äôd like to know what stood out to you about being a student at Columbia, the human aspects of things. You can share from any perspective. 

And if you have any specific advice or observations about the JTS program, feel free to share as well! 

Thanks so much!

Magic: the Gathering players at Columbia
Hi everyone,

3rd-year SEAS student (transferred in this year) and a huge Magic nerd here. I'm trying to find a group of people to play with here, probably starting next year. Basically cool with any format, and if there is a group of 8 or more people I would love to draft.

If there are enough people who play, a tournament of some kind would be AWESOME. Also always down for casual games as well, online or paper.

Any Magic players here? :0 What's your favorite card?

How useful is AP Credit at Columbia SEAS?
Hey guys! 

Columbia is super unique with its core curriculum! But I have a quick question with whether if it‚Äôs useful to have credits going into college. I don‚Äôt want to exempt from any classes, bc all the classes seem super fun. But is it useful to have credit transferred? How can it benefit you? Thank you!!
--------------------------------------------------
AP Credit for Principles of Econ
I'm in SEAS, and part of our Core is to take Principles of Economics (as I'm sure many of you know).  Back in high school, I got a 4 on AP Macro and a 5 on AP Micro, and when I met with my advisor back in August, she informed me that these scores allow me to receive credit instead of having to take Principles of Econ.  I've looked online and confirmed this to be true.  However, it doesn't show up on my transcript, and I've emailed my advisor to ask if there is anything I need to do to ensure I get credit, with no response back.  Does anyone else know how I can guarantee that I've received credit for this requirement?
--------------------------------------------------
Has anyone ever failed a class during covid
Basically the title.

A SEAS student, finished a final for an IEOR class that I'm taking P/F. Scored lower than average for my midterm, so I switched it to P/F. But then I seriously bombed the finals now I don't know if my raw score is going to be above the D range.

I've emailed the professor about the curve and the passing grade for the course, but I'm terrified. What happens when you fail a course? Has anyone gotten an F during these past few semesters of online classes?
--------------------------------------------------
How weird is it that they want us to do the course review survey's during Finals?
I mean really? Why would you pick one of the busiest and most stressful times in the semester to try and get me to do this? What kind of feedback are you expecting? And don't even get me started about how they hold grades hostage on CourseWorks until you do the survey with a ducking pop-up wall...

How does the Columbia Julliard Program work?
I am an international high school student from Australia/New Zealand and I'm interested in applying to overseas universities, especially the US (Columbia) because of this joint program which is currently my area.

PS: I am aware of the insane difficulties associated with studying abroad, let alone one of the top universities in the world. It does seem unrealistic :(

For context: I play piano (used to play flute and sax as well) and my piano teacher was a Julliard graduate. I go to a top-ranked high school but I'm not necessarily the top-ranked student, but I'm trying really hard this year (my final year).

From what I understand, I can study *anything* at Columbia like a normal student, while getting instrument lessons at Julliard for 3 years. Then I have the option of doing MM and BA.

I just wanted to clarify that I'm not restricted to a BA at Columbia in this program: some sources say yes but others say I can study anything. I would be interested in doing something like mathematics/science at Columbia and simultaneously having lessons at Julliard - is this allowed?

People who have been through this program (especially international students!) I would love to hear your experiences and any tips to share to maximize chances of admission.

For context, I want to try to take 2 CS courses this summer because I am a 3/2 student and it would allow me to lighten my workload next year from 9 CS/GTE classes to 7 CS/GTE classes. I did alright in AP, but didn‚Äôt get that great of a grade, do you think C++ will be comparable to AP?

Questions about Latin Honors
When do graduates find out about Latin honors? And how are we notified?

I know that final grades obviously have to be submitted before the registrar can calculate final GPAs, but is this something we find out about before Class Day, or is it a surprise that‚Äôs announced during the ceremony?

Got Turned Away from Vaccine Appointment
So I finally got my appointment for my 1st dose of the vaccine at Lerner. When I got there they wouldn't give it to me since I am leaving NY in about 2 weeks. Has anyone else had this issue?

I'm honestly miffed. The policy should be to get out as many vaccines as possible. I told them I was planning on getting the 2nd dose in Rhode Island where I'll be but they still said no. :(

What does it mean when Econ‚Äôs professors say weighted grades will be curved if needed?
I thought the standard department policy was 1/3 A, 1/3 B, 1/3 C so grades are calculated such that students are numerically ranked based on their total weighted grade and then the top third of the class gets an A, while the median gets a B+. What does it mean when they say the grades will be curved? Won‚Äôt it still be the same top 1/3 of grades receiving an A?
--------------------------------------------------
Does anyone actually go through 4 years at Columbia without a single burnout?
Serious question. Ever since I came to Columbia I've burnt out every semester trying to maintain a good GPA. Online classes added fuel to the fire, and I'm not taking that many credits this sem either

I've had no way of gauging how people feel about the workload and culture here. It seems like some people go through this school with a breeze... but for me it's been like swimming through pure mud‚Äîjust chugging one stroke at a time until we get to our destination which is that sweet graduation. It feels more like surviving than thriving.. Especially with online classes. Am i the only one who feels this way?

Please leave a comment about your experiences here.. I would love to know. Good and bad, hell even just to vent or brag. Thanks

Edit: Thank you guys for all your replies. Glad to know that I'm not the only one out there feeling this way. It's definitely good to hear and perhaps whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

Good luck on finals everyone..

I'm worried about SEAS
So, I'm an incoming freshman planning to go into mechanical engineering. My dream goal in life since I was a child is to become an astronaut. I don't love math but I love physics. I also really prioritize my mental health. I can handle pressure, stress, and anxiety pretty decently I guess, but I *need* free time to actually enjoy my life. I've also never been the most studious during high school, even though I have great grades but it's high school. 

Now, what worries me is that I've seen a damn plethora of people here on reddit and other websites just saying how incredibly hard SEAS can be. How little free time they have for other classes besides engineering requirements and how little free time they have in general. Though I have seen people say the complete opposite, which just makes it more confusing.

If anyone from SEAS or specifically from ME (or even from CC idc) can give me absolutely any advice I'd great greatly appreciate it.

I want to spend my time wisely and have fun all the same. I know that no matter what I do it'll be difficult and there will be stressful times. 
But Imma take the opportunity now, since I've yet to start anything, and make sure I make a good choice

Same A-range among all core sections?
I unfortunately switched into a very difficult CC section this semester. My professor has incredibly strict participation requirements and grades papers very harshly. Meanwhile my friends are in classes where they‚Äôre able to glide through the class with ease and get an A. 

Do all CC (and all core classes for that matter) have about the same A-range? In other words, though my professor is grading my assignments very harshly, do I have about the same chance of getting an A as my peers do?

Bollinger Email: Statement on the Verdict of the Derek Chauvin Trial
 Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:  


Having devoted much of my professional life to the law, and to the ideal of the rule of law, I find the verdict in the killing of George Floyd by police officer Derek Chauvin to be both heartening and depressing. Justice has been met in this case, but it cannot erase the decades and centuries of injustices to Black people. Our collective awareness of this harsh and continuing reality seems‚Äîsadly and shockingly‚Äîto ebb and flow. If we learned anything from the Civil Rights Movement centered around the Supreme Court‚Äôs unanimous decision in *Brown v. Board of Education*, it is that only persistent and painstaking efforts will bring true and comprehensive justice. I have waited for legal judgments before, but none has been more important than this one today, in a state court in Minnesota, to recommitting the society to removing the practices of invidious discrimination against Black Americans.¬†  


Sincerely,  


Lee C. Bollinger

Class of 2025 Guide!
Hi guys, and especially the class of 2025!

Congratulations on getting into Columbia! I thought I'd share with you guys a guide that I wrote with a couple of friends about some of the housing, dining, and meal plan options that will available to you next year! I know it's hard since most of you weren't able to come to campus for days on campus or tours, so hopefully this helps with any decisions or questions that you might have! The guide is currently a WIP (since we're currently in the middle of final exams), but we hope to finish it in the upcoming week!

If anyone has any other questions that aren't on the guide, please let me know! I'll try to add or answer as many as I can! It's the least I can do for you guys :D  


Edit: I just realized I'm a complete dumbo and forgot to share the link, so here you go! Again, if you guys have any questions, please let me know!

B.S in Electrical Engineering in Columbia (combined plan) VS. M.S Electrical Engineering NYU Tandon
I'm deciding on whether to go to Columbia Univerisity¬†(basically for free) for another bachelor's in electrical¬†engineering (2 years) or go to NYU Tandon School of Engineering (have to pay 40k) for an M.S in E.E., which takes 1.5 years. Would I able to get as good of a job coming from getting a bachelor's from an ivy¬†league college like Columbia versus a Master's¬†from NYU Tandon (ranked 36 on US news)? Or would it be worth paying for a master's rather than going for a bachelor's degree and maybe doing the integrated masters program at Columbia?

CCE Summer Funding
Hey everyone :) hope you all are surviving finals week :')

I'm planning on volunteering in a bio lab over the summer and will be applying to the CCE Summer Funding program. Is it difficult to get funding through this program/is it competitive? From any past recipients, how large are the stipends typically? I was hoping to get my rent covered for the summer so I don't have to find a part-time job.

Waitlist for Seminar
Does anyone know how the process goes for getting off a waitlist for a seminar and officially being "accepted" into the class?  I am on the waitlist for one this summer, but the class isn't full and there's only a few student that haven't been put into the class from what I can see.  This will be my first seminar so I am just kind of confused how it works because I know its up to the professor basically who gets in.

Thanks!

Summer Funding Dilemma
I‚Äôm in a bit of a dilemma. I am currently trying to apply tor CCE funding for an internship that I plan on doing this summer at the mailman school of public health at Columbia. One of CCE‚Äôa requirements is that the internship should pay below NYC minimum wage. The internship I applied for pays slightly above minimum wage( but we are paid only at the end of the internship). The problem is that I do not have the funds upfront to pay for housing and transportation cost. I was wondering what to do at this point and if there are any other options I have. Will appreciate any. Thank you so much!

Dorm ??
I know this probably has been posted on here multiple times but I really need help choosing

I am okay with a roommate (unless they're messy af). I want to be social, but would still like some alone time to study and stuffs. I'm also a bit sensitive to smells ( I throw up easily if things smell bad and I'm bringing this up because apparently John Jay can smell a bit )  Also bathrooms... could anyone tell me how clean they are based on each dorm??? I can't find too much info on that for some reason. 

Which dorm would fit me best??

Does anyone have experience with changes in financial aid?
My first-year net cost is  \~30k, and I expect my second-year cost to be about the same. However, my dad recently started making more money so I'm expecting my third-year and fourth-year costs to be closer to 50k (based on the net-price calc).

So, does the financial aid office tend to keep your net cost around the same, or will I definitely be paying 50k+ in my third and fourth year? How does that work?

If you take summer courses at Columbia as a Columbia student, do you have to be on campus/in NYC or can you take them remotely? Pre and post covid
I‚Äôd like to take courses over the summers to fulfill my Core requirements so that I can take more courses I‚Äôm interested in during the year. If we were in a covid-nonexistent world, would I have to be on campus to do this? Or would I be able to take them online. 

Do you think that the University will start to offer online courses that meet degree & core requirements as we return from online learning? 

Thanks so much!

Swarthmore vs. Columbia
Hello Columbians,

I was recently admitted to Columbia College (RD), and I've narrowed down my choices to Columbia and Swarthmore. I am immensely greatly for these opportunities, but I've been having a tough time trying to determine what school would be best for me. I know these are VERY different schools, but May 1st isn't going to arrive any later, so I was hoping to share my pro/cons list, see what current students think, and ask a few specific questions at the end of this long post.

Just for some background, I‚Äôm a prospective history or philosophy major, but there‚Äôs a chance that this direction will change, so nothing is set in stone.

**Swarthmore**

Pros

* Intimate class sizes
* Frequent professor contact
* Close to Philadelphia
* P/F first semester + 4 P/F classes later on. Great for adjustment
* Close to home
* Student culture seems friendly and collaborative (but very stressed). I would probably feel more "comfortable" here

Cons

* VERY intense academics. My mental health will probably suffer, just as it will with any of these top colleges.
* Allergies...
* Much less name recognition for getting jobs out of college. Career services absolutely suck, apparently. This school is designed for prospective graduates, and I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm totally set on graduate school, though there is a solid chance that I‚Äôll eventually go to graduate school sometime in my life.
* If I end up not fitting in with the kids, I'll have less opportunities to make new friends

**Columbia**

Pros

* The location is phenomenal
* An immense amount of resources and unparalleled opportunities. Probably the best job prospects of all three choices right out of college
* Small classes for core curriculum classes
* High chance for a single dorm freshman year
* Prestige :I
* The Core really excites me and I think it‚Äôs a great vehicle for creating a more cohesive community in a place of little cohesion
* 4 P/F classes will be helpful

Cons

* I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll become lonely in such a large school and I don‚Äôt want to seep through the cracks. A more supportive community will probably be best for my mental health, though not as fruitful for my general growth/personal development
* Huge classes for introductory and STEM courses. TAs will be very frequent
* With 20,000+ graduates, professors care about research/graduates first and undergraduates second, so professor contact will be infrequent and I fear they may be more unapproachable than the professors at a small liberal arts college.
* Seems like a pressure-cooker environment that isn‚Äôt very friendly. Academics will be tough like Swarthmore, though it doesn‚Äôt seem as collaborative

**General Questions about Columbia**

* The intensity of both these schools just seems abstract to me, and I don‚Äôt think I can really comprehend just what I‚Äôm getting myself into. Maybe I‚Äôm reading the wrong comments, but is it true that you‚Äôll need to read about 100 pages every day of the week to keep up in a single class? I guess a better question would be whether I should let the intensity of these schools deter me from enrolling. Any thoughts on the stress culture, workload, or etc. are welcome.
* I know this community will probably have bias toward Columbia and won‚Äôt really have sufficient information to answer this question, but is the LAC experience overidealized? Sure, the class sizes are small and you‚Äôll get more professor contact, but to what extent is that really going to affect your educational experience?
* How isolating can the campus feel if you don‚Äôt make friends? How difficult is it to make friends? I understand this may vary, but I just wanted to hear some individual perspectives
* Does the fact that Columbia is primarily a graduate research institution affect the quality of your education? How often do you wish you could have more contact with your professors?
* Does a college's "fit" need to be the most important factor you consider in a college?

As a closing note, I want to bring up something Professor Gareth Williams told admitted Columbia students earlier today that really resonated with me. He said something along the lines of, ‚Äúit would be a disappointment if my undergraduate experience was a reaffirmation of the person I was when I entered college. I want to be stretched and become someone who I am not.‚Äù Swarthmore and Columbia will both certainly stretch me academically, but I think Columbia provides more potential in terms of personal growth. Yet, Columbia is a school where you only get out as much as you put in, and I fear that I'm severely overestimating my abilities to act on such opportunities.

Taking chinese language course?
I‚Äôm a rising junior in SEAS thinking of taking Chinese pdf in the fall (so it‚Äôs not for a language requirement). I‚Äôve taken chinese in high school and scored a 5 on the ap exam so I‚Äôm not a complete beginner. Is there a placement test that I can take?
--------------------------------------------------
GS/Dual Degree folks: did GS send you anything in the mail or anything to welcome you? Or was it only your partner institution
I got in through the Joint Program with the Jewish Theological Seminary and I‚Äôve gotten emails and letters (and even merchandise!) from JTS. This hasn‚Äôt been the case with GS/Columbia. Is it silly or unrealistic to expect GS to extend the same sort of welcome (emails, webinars, packages) that CC does to its accepted students? Or is it simply not a part of GS protocol to reach out to accepted students? I was hoping that I‚Äôd be able to make connections with other GS students who aren‚Äôt part of my specific program.

[ I also got into Barnard via JTS, and they sent me stickers and have been emailing me links to webinars etc (I won‚Äôt be going there, though, as they didn‚Äôt give me enough aid).]

Thanks!

Summer Internship
 I'm honestly so lost on how to get internships. I'm Columbia '25, majoring in cs with a apma minor. When I got in, I was happy but now I'm just so fucking stressed. I don't know what I'm supposed to this summer. I tried finding internships the past few months but didn't even receive 1 interview, forget about offers.

So instead I managed to find some informal research w a prof, but I don't know how that will turn out/if it will even be resume worthy. A lot of people have been saying I need to make a project, but I really fucking hate making independent projects. I'd rather be in a structured program like research/internship or be studying coursework. But it seems like its not possible to get an internship without a project, so it's something I'm gonna have to do.

But the main issue is wtf I'm supposed to do for summer 2022. Applications for tech stuff come out in August right? How do I even have a chance of getting in. My resume is so garbage right now. I couldnt even make USAMO (fucking 3 points off). My only work experience is teaching middle schoolers at a learning center. Like how the fuck is anyone gonna hire me off this?

But tech isn't what I want to do long term. Its just for 2022. Eventually, I want to be a quant trader at Jane Street/Citadel/Two Sigma etc. But, I know its impossible for freshman, so thats why I desperately need a tech internship freshman summer. Sophomore summer, I think it's at least *theoretically* possible to get into one of the quant firms, but still hard, so I'm fine with doing tech that summer if necessary. But junior year I definitely need to break into a top quant firm otherwise I don't know how I'm supposed to live with myself.

But anyway, that quant stuff is a little ways away. I won't have to worry about applying for at least a year. But tech, tech is soon. Like *very* soon. Anyone have any tips on how I can secure one given my background thus far?

Is there a better way to contact Registrar to get a clear answer? It‚Äôs frustrating not knowing before taking final exam.

How is the CVN MS in Computer Science at Columbia?
 Hello! I have recently received an admit for CVN MS in CS for Fall 21 with a planned focus of vision, graphics, interaction, and robotics. I am deciding between this school and another. I have questions about the program:

1. How is the CVN MS CS program? How is the computer science courses' rigor? if I plan a career in graphics, what are the pros and cons of the courses? Old content etc.?  Would I be prepared?
2. Are all breadth and track cs courses offered for CVN or only some courses are available to take?
3. Internships/Job outlooks?

COVID Vaccine Required to be in person for Fall
> On the strong recommendation of our public health colleagues, who have advised us so ably throughout this process, President Bollinger and the Columbia University COVID Task Force have decided to make the COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for all students who are present on campus, starting this fall. We will provide religious and medical exemptions, as we do for the influenza and measles vaccines, in accordance with New York State public health laws.

> The vaccine mandate for students will be integrated into our Columbia Community Health Compact, an agreement all students are required to sign in order to access campus facilities.

> we are committed to providing vaccination to returning students in the fall, if they have not been vaccinated. However, please do not wait until then. We strongly encourage everyone to be vaccinated as soon as possible, including international students.¬†

Re-Using Letters of Recommendation in Re-Application?
Apologies in advance if this is not the correct sub for this.

I'm current in the process of applying for the MS Bridge Program in Computer Science. Unfortunately, I started my application after the priority deadline but I figured I may as well submit an application in the chance of a rolling admission despite a significant decrease in the chance of admissibility. I figured if I can't be admitted due to a space issue, I could re-apply next year.

I was wondering, are you able to re-use recommendation letters when re-applying? I've checked the school of engineering's website but couldn't find any guidance regarding re-applying / re-using letters.

I remember reading for a different school at Columbia (can't remember which one) that the recommendation letters are valid for a year after they're received and can be used for a re-application as long as it's within that one year (I assume they remain in the system?). Does anyone know if this applies to the engineering school as well?

Looking For Roommate
Hey guys, I am an incoming MSCS student who just graduated from college. I am originally from China and have been in the US since high school. I am looking for a roommate to room within a 2b1b apartment. My budget is around $1500 to $1600. I will be studying a lot and barely going out. I am a pretty tidy person (but not OCD), and I prefer my roommate to be reasonably clean, too.  I'd like to keep a consistent sleep schedule, so I prefer if my roommate has a regular sleep schedule/can be quiet around sleep time. Please DM me if you are interested!

I am finishing up my undergraduate at Vanderbilt University. I will be studying most of the time, but maybe going out once a week or so. I like to maintain a clean room. Preferred max budget of \~1200 per person. DM me if anyone is interested in rooming together.

Making friends at Columbia??
Hey everyone, I'm not sure if I'm allowed to be advertising on here but I really really *really* think that this post could help everyone meet new people and make the pandemic a little less crappy.

I'm living off-campus and I feel like it's basically impossible to meet new people. Like wtf am I supposed to do, slide into people's dms on zoom? So for the past month, some friends and I have been working on this project called [berri.io](https://berri.io/). Think of it as anonymous, wholesome Tinder for making friendships; matches are made based on interests, personality, and answers to fun questions! We just launched and I think you guys would *really* enjoy it‚Äìsign up and make your profile [here](https://berri.io/)! You can also match with students from the other schools that we've launched to if you're looking to meet more people.

I know there‚Äôs a lot going on nowadays, but we're hoping this can be a nice change of pace with fun wholesome vibes :))

Columbia Vs. Yale Pre med
Hi Guys!!! I am struggling to decide between Yale & Columbia for pre- med. I have heard good things about both; however, I have heard that Columbia pre- med is quite difficult compared to other ivies.  Columbia is also more expensive (NYC Prices smh). At the same time, though, Columbia ranks higher for my major (neuroscience) + columbia med is one of my dream med schools. Would attending Columbia for undergrad give me a slight advantage?  Any advice? And yeah, ik, I shouldn't choose a college based on pre med plans, but I genuinely don't see myself doing anything else with my life atm lol. And I don't really think I can go wrong with either tbh. Oh, also, I was selected as a John Jay Scholar, but idk if that extra advising is worth much. I've seen a lot of mixed comments online.

Alternative Class for Intermediate Spanish II?
I've completed elementary spanish I - intermediate spanish I. I took intermediate spanish I over a year ago and I'm not confident in my spanish to do well in Intermediate spanish II. I heard there is a non-language related course that students can take to cover the last foreign language requirement? Is this true? If so, is the class easy? I really don't want to take intermediate spanish II.

Thanks!

Best grad ML and CV courses at Columbia?
Hey everyone! I‚Äôm an incoming grad student at SEAS. I‚Äôll be majoring in electrical engineering. 

I have the option of taking up courses outside of my department and was hoping for suggestions. I‚Äôm looking for really hands on courses where the assignments are mostly more practical and industry oriented! 

Thanks in advance :)

Address to Put for Dorm2Dorm Pickup Location?
Hello everybody! First-year here.

I need to put some books in stasis for the summer, and I've decided on using Dorm2Dorm. Apparently the way it works is that they send me a box, I fill it, and then a while later someone drives along and picks it up from me. 

My problem is that I have absolutely no idea what to put for a good pickup address. I'm currently on the Morningside campus, and any help would be much appreciated!

NYU vs Columbia 2025
My financial aid for both schools is really good and I'm also a resident of Brooklyn. I have a variety of interests and don't exactly know what I want to major in. I would be dorming for Columbia but commuting to NYU. I'm concerned about dorming but also the academics in general. I know both schools are rigorous academically (although Columbia seems more daunting). I like both, but don't know which one to go for. Any suggestions or advice? Thanks :)

Students who have a desktop in their room, what do you do after the semester ends?
Considering Columbia doesn't have storage space for students to use, I was wondering what people who have desktops do with theirs. Do you guys store it in a nearby storage service, take it home, or something else?

To add on to the topic of big stuff in your dorm room (e.g. refrigerator), what can we do with them if we don't want to sell them? I'm an international student so shipping a desktop/refrigerator/etc. back to my country... isn't really desirable.
--------------------------------------------------
Columbia vs UMich for CS Undergrad
I was fortunate enough to get into both the University of Michigan (CoE) and Columbia University (SEAS) for CS as a transfer. Both appeal to me equally, and the cost of attending is the same, which is making it hard to decide. I was wondering if you had any thoughts on which one I should go for. My main concern is the huge number of grad students compared to undergrads at Columbia. Thanks.

How many people does Columbia rescind every year?
And how many people does Columbia rescind due to a grade drop/academics?

&#x200B;

I was doing IB but my country cancelled exams as per a government mandate, so there's a very good chance my IB scores are going to be absolutely crap as its determined my grades will be determined by an algorithm that takes into account school history and my coursework from the year (so anywhere from 2-7 point drop from predicted cuz my school history is crap basically lol). Would this cause them to rescind me?

All comments appreciated! :)

Opinions about the Value Investing program in Columbia Business School?
I've done some research, and the Value Investing in The Heilbrunn Center for Graham & Dodd Investing program sounds amazing because many courses are taught by real administrators, and the philosophy of the program seems adapted to the real world, unlike the vast majority of business schools. However, I have not found many opinions from people close to the university, so:

Does anyone have experiences or opinions about the program?

I would appreciate any comments regarding the program.

Do you think it's possible to live in Greenpoint and commute to Columbia every day? From your experience, what's the proportion of early-morning classes that require traveling peak times? Have you done it/do you know anyone who has done that? Curious what current students think!

Physics Sequences (UN1400 vs UN1600)
Hi all, 

I'm an incoming freshman at SEAS looking to minor in Applied Physics. I'm very interested in Physics and would love to challenge myself in the subject but unfortunately, my current experience is only through AP Physics I (Algebra-based) and Calculus I as these are the most advanced science and math courses my school offers. Because of this, would it be feasible to go with the 1600 track or should I stick with 1400 because of my lack of experience? Thanks in advance!

Questions about Deferring M.A. for a Year
Hi everyone, apologies if I am posting in the wrong space. I am still figuring out a lot, and honestly very shocked I was admitted to my M.A. Program.

Anyway, I wanted to ask if any M.A. students here have applied to defer their enrollment for a year? I believe I have a good reason (taking care of a sick sibling) but want to know if I would have to give documentation and if anyone had experience not being granted a deferral? I don't want to mess up my acceptance if I ask and don't get it. 

Thank you!

Housing overnight guest policy?
For context, I'm a grad student and I have an offer for a studio apartment in graduate housing. 

While reading up on residential policies, I noticed that overnight guests are only allowed to stay for 5 days in any 30-day period, although it seems now it's only 2 days due to COVID (which will hopefully be lifted by the Fall term), and that you're not allowed to leave your keys with them.

The thing is, I'd kind of like to be able to have guests stay over for longer periods of time, particularly when initially moving in. This'll be my first time in NYC (and NY for that matter) and things would be a lot easier if I had someone there with me when starting out. 

Are these policies actually enforced? How stringent are they?

P/D/F
In regards to the P/D/F policy, is it a good idea to protect GPA at all costs? What I mean by that is the following: If I am taking four classes this semester, and I receive an A-, A-, A-, B+ in them respectively, and I just so happened to have selected the course I got a B+ in as my P/D/F option, should I keep the P in it for the sake of protecting my GPA, or should I uncover it since a B+ is a good grade? 

Another question: is it generally not recommendable to have a P rather than a grade in a class that applies to your major directly?

Thank you
--------------------------------------------------
Grad student housing
I'm an incoming 2L Law student (not transfer, doing a dual degree) and I have my housing selection appointment coming up tomorrow. The format is honestly really new to me since my undergrad was done abroad (where you just pick the housing you want at any time prior to a certain deadline and they tell you if it's available), but I think I mostly get it.

There are just a few points that I'm pretty unsure about. First of all, are there no photos available of the units I'll be selecting? There seem to be photos of undergraduate housing, but none for the graduate options. 

Also, when I was filling out the housing form, I put down some preferences that in hindsight were pretty dumb. For context, I'm originally from another country and I'm most definitely not used to NYC prices. I really thought I could get something for under 1.4k so I put that as the maximum monthly rate. On impulse (since I was trying to go for the cheapest options possible and since I read that housing is limited and it's a good idea to apply ASAP) and really without thinking much further, I also selected "apartment share" as a second preference, which is honestly not something I'd like now that I think about it a bit more. Am I only going to be shown options that fit those criteria or will I also be able to see units that fit outside those categories (i.e. stuff that isn't my first preference type of unit + apartment shares or stuff that costs more than 1.4k)?

If I don't end up picking a unit from those I'm offered, is it still plausible at this point in time to apply again and get a second appointment?

Running out of Housing Space?
My lottery number is unfortunate (to put it lightly), and I have yet to choose my room for the Fall 2021 semester.  I've been monitoring the real-time availability database religiously, and as of 6:37pm EDT, there appear to be 3 spaces left for individual students (not registering as a group).

GS at Columbia University as service member
Hey guys, I immigrated from Latin America as a teenager, after graduating High School in NY I attended a 2 year college, transferred to a 4 year school and after a semester I enlisted in the ARMY National Guard to become a medic. I had to take 2 semesters from school to complete my military training. I returned from training last summer and completed one more semester at my four year school. Now I have been placed in active duty orders till September in the COVID mission to help administer the vaccine.   
I would like to transfer to Columbia University in the General studies program as I will be eligible for the post 911 GI BILL and I know Columbia would be a better fit for me. 

My questions are:

\-How likely I am to get accepted into the GS program given the fact that I am a non-traditional student and my military experience

&#x200B;

\-I am still in the National Guard and will be at the time I apply to Columbia GS, therefore I will not be considered a veteran will that decreased my chances of getting accepted?

\-for any MilVets/GS students, what is admissions looking for in their applicants

CS through Columbia GS - Recruiting
Hi everyone, I was recently admitted into the School of General Studies. I‚Äôm 24 looking to major in computer science and will graduate at about age 26-27. However, I‚Äôm curious about the recruiting prospects as a GS CS student at CU.

Stop me if I'm wrong - companies come to campus with a set number of people they are looking to hire. If I'm in the mix with CC/SEAS students during recruiting season, how will that subjectively affect my chances of landing an offer with a visiting company?

Assuming I‚Äôm a competitive applicant (strong grades, technical knowledge, networking and interviewing skills), are my odds of receiving an interview/job offer from a top company like Google tangibly lower than that of an **equally-qualified** traditional student? To what extent does this bias exist among recruiters?

I haven‚Äôt seen any statistics that specifically highlight GS-CS recruitment but would like to know how well GS CS students do when competing for jobs. Right now, I'm assuming they do just as well as others.

I would greatly appreciate any honest thoughts and observations, as these are answers I probably won't receive from calling the school. Thanks in advance!

Class of 2026 Obsessed with Columbia
Hi! Congrats to everyone from ‚Äò25 who got in!! 


I‚Äôm a next cycle ED applicant to Columbia College and lowkey, VERY stressed right now ‚Äì ever since I discovered A2C and all other college subreddits, I‚Äôve been obsessively scrolling through and have realized that compared to most admitted students, my stats are pretty average :/ 


I believe Columbia is really the right fit for me, and I‚Äôd rather not be anywhere else. Obviously, I‚Äôm gonna try my best to strengthen my essays, but I‚Äôm still nervous about my stats and ECs potentially dragging me down. 


To make matters worse, I‚Äôm an Asian girl (not American though, grew up in Japan, China, Singapore) and my ECs are painfully Asian, too. I‚Äôm also applying to be on a premed track, and my school (located in greater Boston so no rural points) sends many students to Ivies but never Columbia so there‚Äôs absolutely no relationship, and so many more disadvantages...


Is there anyone who‚Äôs willing to connect with me to share their experiences in regards to the application process? Any advice about essays, what I should do now as a junior, etc, are welcomeüò©üò© I‚Äôd love for others to review my specific background info and stats. (look at me inviting roasts) My sanity is gone, period. and I need you.

First-Year Housing: Furnald
Hey everyone! I'm an incoming first year currently doing housing selection, and I'm currently choosing between Furnald and John Jay. I'm leaning towards Furnald, but I'm slightly worried by the 'anti-social' reputation it has - if you lived in Furnald, were you still able to make friends on your floor? (eg would there be people chatting in the floor lounge)

On the other hand, I very much prioritise cleanliness, so is it really true that Furnald (bathrooms, lounges etc) are generally cleaner? Is there a difference in pests (eg rats, cockroaches) between the two buildings? And how often are the bathrooms in Furnald/John Jay cleaned?

Edit: I also wanted to check - is there any place in the housing portal where we can indicate our preference for a single / double? The admitted students portal said that we could indicate our preference, but I didn't see any place to do that in the portal! 

Thanks for all your help :)

how badly will I do in intro to stat reasoning
Taking it w/ prof Victor de la Pena and can‚Äôt really find anything about him.

I am...bad at math. Very bad. I also haven‚Äôt taken a math class in like 5+ years so god damn I‚Äôm allowed to be bad at math but how hard is this class for someone who doesn‚Äôt do math? How‚Äôs the prof?

Prospective 2026 Student
Hi, everyone!! 

First off, congrats to all the Class of 2025 admits! You guys should be so so proud of yourselves :) 

Columbia has been my dream school for YEARS. I joined Reddit specifically for this subreddit so that I can learn as much as I can. I'm going to apply ED and list Sustainable Development as my major of interest. I have a really "weird" fascination with agriculture and I want to find ways to make it more efficient and economical for the growing population, specifically with the application of data science and AI/ML. This major along with the Lamont-Doherty Earth Institute and the new Climate School are state-of-the-art institutions that will hopefully help me achieve my goals. 

I attended Columbia's Fall Virtual High School program and I'm set to attend the summer program as well. Because of this, I also have a Columbia email which gives me access to certain seminars and events such as the "Seminar in Race, Climate Change, and Environmental Justice" put on by the Earth Institute. I know Columbia does not track demonstrated interest; I purely go to these just to learn as much as I can. With all this being said, I do have a fairly large dilemma...

I currently go to a public school in LA; however, there are about 10 private schools within a 15-mile radius of me. My school has been known for not getting any students into Ivy Leagues because of the surrounding private schools. Every so often, a student will get into UPenn, Cornell, or Brown- no Columbia admits though (my school was established 50 years ago). I guess my question is: Do you think it's even worth applying ED? My heart is telling me that I belong at Columbia but my brain is telling me to be practical and use my "golden ticket (ED)" for a university that actually accepts students from my high school.

I would appreciate any help y'all could give me!
--------------------------------------------------
How much work do you get?
Joining a PhD program at CU in the Fall, coming from a much lower ranked school. I worked hard in undergrad, but most of it was self directed (things I didn‚Äôt *have* to do). But I can imagine Columbia courses are way more rigorous. I‚Äôm anxious because I don‚Äôt know what to expect. Could someone give me an idea as to how much they study every day? (Doesn‚Äôt have to be a grad student, any perspective helps)

columbia/juilliard or yale?
hi!! I‚Äôm a prospective class of 2025 student and I‚Äôve been looking between yale (which I was admitted REA) and columbia, which I received a likely letter for and was admitted to the exchange program with the juilliard school. I‚Äôve been told to make a pros and cons list, but I was wondering if anyone here has perspective on things that I didn‚Äôt mention or things I need to know about columbia that might influence my decision?

columbia pros: 

‚Ä¢ it‚Äôs in nyc, which provides great opportunities for music and it‚Äôs also my favorite city!

‚Ä¢ more financial aid (small difference though)

‚Ä¢ opportunity for juilliard lessons

yale pros:

‚Ä¢ residential college system

‚Ä¢ the opportunity to double major and more academic freedom (afaik) 

‚Ä¢ school spirit and traditions

‚Ä¢ strong alumni network 

‚Ä¢ good arts community/orchestra

columbia cons: 

‚Ä¢ personally not a fan of the core curriculum‚Äî it feels a bit rigid? 

‚Ä¢ not much of a campus?

yale cons: 

‚Ä¢ lack of conservatory style music lessons (?)

‚Ä¢ not metropolitan‚Äî less musical opportunities outside campus

this feels like a crossroads for me because I love both schools, but choosing between them almost feels like I‚Äôm choosing my career path. three more weeks until I have to commit, but making the decision has been really difficult :/

UCI's MS in Statistics vs. Columbia's MA in Statistics?
I recently got accepted to both programs. I'm interested in entering the job market out of the master's program, not in pursuing a PhD. I came across some questionable information about Columbia's MA that concerned me. It seems that there are people concerned about the majority of adjunct professors teaching in the program and its reputation as a "cash cow," though some seem to think that it can be helpful in establishing connections if one takes advantages of the best parts of the program (mainly its location and the job fairs on Columbia's campus). I'm having a hard time gauging whether or not the program/a degree with Columbia's name on it would be worth the expense over Irvine's. 

Is there anyone with experience with one or both of these programs who might have some advice to give? I have to decide by April 15th, and I'm having a really hard time finding helpful information. Thanks!

a few questions about the science requirement from an incoming freshman
ok so I just committed to Columbia (yay!) and i am very excited, but i have a few questions about the science requirement. 

I am a very artsy/humanities person, and I plan on majoring in english and/or visual arts. I am an international student and have only done the british education system. Therefore, i have not taken a math class since i was 16, and the only science i took was biology which i also have not done since i was 16. i only did a bit of physics and chemistry when i was 14.  Mind you, i did get good grades when i took biology/math, but that was a walk in the park compared to what is taught at Columbia. 

Could anyone tell me if the science requirement is particularly difficult for a humanities/artsy student? Or will I be able to cope? Thank u!

Dear vs Ansaf for AI
I just got off the waitlist for Dear's Artifical Intelligence course in the summer (but I'm also waitlisted for Ansaf's in the fall). I personally really do love Ansaf's teaching style but I don't have much experience with Dear - are there any recommendations? They both seem to be quite highly rated on CULPA / from what I've heard.

For context, in the summer I would be taking it with Fundies and a PE class (so not too sure about the workload bc intensive) and the Fall would be alongside AP but a generally low workload bc I've heard AP is rough. (If I take AI in the Summer, I might try replace it with like NLP or PLT in the fall)

Summer housing questions
Hello! 

I just got approved for summer housing, and I was wondering how the selection process for rooms will work.  Will we be assigned a lottery number and have to pick specific rooms as usual, or will we just randomly be assigned a room without being able to list preferences?  Also, will restrictions be more lax this summer, i.e. will friends who live in a different dorm be allowed to swipe into our dorms and visit us?

Thanks!

Masters in economics: Columbia versus NYU

Hi everyone! I‚Äôm a senior in undergrad and have recently been accepted to NYU and Columbia‚Äôs masters programs for economics. Everything I find has them ranked somewhat the same and it looks like the coursework is very similar. 
I am drawn to NYU because of the neighborhood but my mom claims this is not a good reason to go there. I just love nyc and know the area pretty well so it draws me in mire than the area of Columbia. I am unsure of what I want to do after getting my degree but am considering staying in academia and maybe pursuing a phd. I‚Äôm also really interested in game theory and econometrics specifically. (I am a double major in Econ and math so I‚Äôm not opposed to lots of math). 
Additionally, money should not be much of a problem, not that it matters cuz these are both so expensive. 
Does anyone have any experience with one or the other? Are professors at one school more prestigious than the other? I know Columbia has the Ivy name, but how much is this worth/is it worth it? 
Any insight would be greatly appreciated! 
Thanks so much!

Appealing Financial Aid Question
I am currently in the process of writing a letter to the financial aid office in order to get my offer appealed. I have been gracious enough to receive merit based scholarships from other competitive schools that would make it very affordable for me to go there, however, when looking at Columbia's appeal form it says that they only consider need based aid from other schools. Would it still be advisable for me to mention in my letter that these schools would be much more affordable even if it is through merit based scholarships?

Financial Aid Appeal Advice
Hello! I'm an international student that was accepted to the Class of 2025. Sadly, I got very little financial aid and it is impossible for my family to afford the university. I'm frustrated about it because one of the main reasons I applied to Columbia was that I heard it gave great financial aid. My family is even thinking of starting a crowdfunding campaign or something like that.

Do you have any advice for the appeal process? I would be extremely grateful.

P.S. The financial circumstances of my family have been affected by the pandemic so I will be sure to include that and explain other things that may not have been reflected by my CSS profile. It is also important to note that as an international student I do not have all the different options US citizens have for financing their education.

PDF Deadline is before we know our grades?
Hello all. 

Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong about two things 1) P/D/F is supposed to help you and 2) In the fall we chose which class to PDF after we knew our grades. 

Since if we PDF a class we think we aren‚Äôt doing well in only for that class to do better than others, aren‚Äôt we hurting our GPA since we could have PDFed a different course. 

What‚Äôs more with the strike this semester many of us simply have no idea how we are doing in a class so we might as well print our classes out and throw a dart on the sheet and whichever it hits is the one we PDF?

I must be wrong somewhere so please (gently) correct me.

Complex variables vs Honors complex variables
Hello! 

I‚Äôm a math major in CC right now trying to decide between taking Complex Variables with Ovidiu Savin and taking Honors Complex Variables with Julien Dub Dat.  I don‚Äôt really have any prior experience with the material covered, and was wondering if anyone would be willing to give some advice on which to take.  I want to gain as rigorous of an understanding of the subject as possible, but will also have a very heavy workload in the fall so the relative workload of each course will play an important factor for me as well. Is the difference between them comparable to the difference between the typical Calc sequence vs the honors math sequence? Also, if anyone has any experience with these professors what are their teaching styles like?

Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------
AI vs NLP
Hi, I am deciding between AI (with Professor Dear) vs NLP (with Professor Bauer) for a summer class.

I am on the applications track and I do not have many credits left to take both.

I would like to ask which class is more practical and relevant to the person who is into web and application development (or getting a job at a decent tech company asap to pay off my student loans).

Do any of those classes cover the materials (like algorithms or general knowledge) that are somewhat related to tech interviews from job applications?

I‚Äôm worried that it may be too much on top of my fall semester I do have to take (senior year, 2 STEM classes and 2 humanities), and yet it still fascinates me. I‚Äôm especially interested to learn (albeit indirectly) scientific communication from this professor. 

Thoughts?

Columbia vs Stanford
This week, I have been accepted into Columbia and Stanford, and I'm struggling with making a choice. I want to study to computer, but I'm open to other STEM disciplines. Also, please don't say go to Stanford because they have a better computer science program. I got a likely from Columbia and accepted into the CUSP program, but Stanford was my dream school up until this year.

I'm queer, Black, and from the suburbs of Missouri, and I want to experience something new. I'm a bit of an introvert, but I generally get along with most people. Activism and diversity are also very important to me.

If you go to/graduated from Columbia, can you answer these questions?

* For cs students, how big were your intro classes?
* Is there mental health support?
* For Black people (especially women), how did your peers treat you?
* Is the engineering core too restricting?
* And anything else I should know about the school.

Calculus Requirement
I will most likely be attending Columbia in the fall, and I have a few questions about the calculus requirement for the engineering school that I was hoping someone could help answer. 

Junior year I took calculus 1 as a dual Enrollment class that my high school offers. This year (senior year) I did an independent study with the same professor that taught my dual enrollment class. The first semester of my independent study was calc 2 and the second semester is calc 3. I have basically taken calc BC and multi variable calculus, but it‚Äôs just not called that. I have done extremely well in these classes and have developed strong calculus skills. I don‚Äôt expect Columbia to give me credit for these classes because they were dual enrollment and not AP, but I really don‚Äôt want to be placed in calc 1. I would be fine with retaking calc 3 or even calc 2 because I really enjoyed them, but having to retake calc 1 sounds like such a waste of time. 

Does anyone know if I will have to be placed in calc 1 to meet my requirement for the engineering core classes?

New course alert for Fall semester
[A while ago I posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/m34lhq/get_notified_when_new_coursessections_are_added/) about a twitter bot that tracks when new courses and sections are added to the Columbia directory. 

It was originally just for the summer but since Columbia can't quite get their shit together I set it up for the fall too. It'll only track new undergraduate classes so hopefully there's less spam than the original version. The messages are much cleaner and have more information now too.

This will be helpful to those (including me) trying to get physed classes since they have announced more sections but haven't posted them to the directory yet. I think some other departments are similarly delayed.

Hope its helpful!

Scared to commit
I was accepted into the class of 2025 and so far Columbia is my first choice but the more I think about committing, the more I doubt my abilities and my ability to succeed in an Ivy League environment. My high school was very easy for me: not competitive at all, tight-knit community with teachers and faculty, and no honors or AP courses available. I was able to get through all of high school putting in only a little effort and still getting good grades. I know I have a good work ethic but I'm scared that my lack of experience with a competitive environment and with heavy coursework is going to make Columbia extremely difficult for me. 

Anyone have any words of wisdom or advice as to how to get over this fear and what I can expect going into Columbia?

MSW: Columbia or NYU
Hello!

I am hoping to complete my MSW to become a child/adolescent therapist, and I have applied to only a few schools.  CSSW is the only one that I haven't heard back from yet, but I should be hearing within the next week (hopefully).

&#x200B;

I have already been accepted to NYU (both Silver and Steinhardt).  By the time I hear back from Columbia, I will have to make a very quick decision, as the NYU deadlines are right around the corner. If I don't get accepted, obviously the decision is made for me.  But if I do get accepted, does anyone have any insight on how these programs compare? Particularly for my specific focus on working as a therapist for children?

was just admitted to CC 2025! idk if i should commit!!!
hello everyone! i'm an international student who was just accepted to Columbia College and i'm feeling super thrilled to have this opportunity. however, i'm having a bit of trouble trying to figure out whether i should commit to Columbia or not. frankly, i feel very anxious about coming and not doing well academically, not making great relationships, etc. though i also know that these are common fears among incoming freshmen anywhere.

i've also seen some tweets/posts by current students about their poor mental health/not feeling happy at Columbia. i'm just afraid of making the wrong decision after making a big move to NYC.

i would appreciate all thoughts and opinions concerning this! for some context: i'm a prospective Middle Eastern Studies/Creative Writing major (and Columbia's departments for both of these areas are incredible) and i'm hoping to later on go to a great grad school + explore careers in education, publishing, and writing. i know Columbia is a great opportunity and i'm not sure if my anxieties are worth paying attention to.

thank you, friends! :)

Basic Drawing class with no experience?
I really want to learn some basic drawing skills but I've never done art before, so I'm worried about being behind or struggling in the class. I want to take Basic Drawing in the fall (with Nash Glynn, I think) but I'm worried it will take up too much of my time and bring down my GPA. I'm also in SEAS and this is completely unrelated to my major, I just want to draw more than a subpar stick figure. Does anyone have any experience or advice?

Columbia vs MIT for CS (please read before commenting)
I‚Äôm very lucky to be admitted to both of these schools, but this is a very hard choice for me. Columbia has been my dream school since middle school, but after an MIT summer program, I switched over to MIT. I applied EA and was admitted, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll attend. I live with a single mother and my little sis is going off to a private boarding school(same program i did). I don‚Äôt want my mom to be by herself so I applied to Princeton and Columbia on a whim so I could stay close by. I was admitted to both but I like Columbia way more. 

I‚Äôll be blunt, I want to achieve the greatest financial success for my family since we are low income(20k a year) and in extreme debt. The main thing pulling me to Columbia is the fact that it‚Äôs so close to home and I‚Äôm able to stay by my mom while my sister goes off to boarding school. 

I know CS is a hard industry, but if I do Google CSSI + an MIT summer program on my name, how hard would it be to land an internship after freshman or sophomore year?

Would going to MIT make a substantial difference in CS internship/job opportunities?

CS MAJOR ADVICE
Hello! I just found out that I got accepted into Columbia University's class of 2025 as a CS major. I didn't think I would get in and kind of worked hard on kissing up to my second choice school (NJIT) so that it would be an easy transition for me if I were to go there. Now that I could possibly go to Columbia, I have a couple of questions and it would be great if anyone could answer them! 

1.) I'm currently dually enrolled at NJIT and I was wondering if Columbia accepts dual enrollment credits. I took and passed Calc I and I'm currently taking CS100 AKA an intro to python class. 

2.) How much do students typically pay for tuition including the financial aid?

3.) As a CS major, what computer should I get? Windows or Mac?

4.) Is it easy to receive mentorship? At NJIT, I was accepted into EOP and they have a wide connection amongst students, mentors, and job recruiters. Does Columbia have the same type of connections?

5.) How are the dorms at this school?

6.) Would it be possible for me to study abroad as a CS major?

Thank you guys so much!! Any answer will be appreciated ü•∫

Engineering Combined Plan
Hi there, 

I tried to find this question here but I was not able to.

 Is there anyone here that is doing engineering with the combined program/plan? (a combined plan that you study 3 years in liberal arts and then 2 years at Columbia)

If so, do you think that it is being worth it? pros and cons?

Thank you!

i was admitted to columbia as a kluge scholar and i wanted to hear about some current students‚Äô STEM/bio/premed experiences (both positive and negative) and whether you guys think it‚Äôs worth it... 

also, is anyone studying under the medical humanities major? i was always intrigued by it but chose bio at the time of applying...

Physics lab?
Is General Physics I Lab required if you‚Äôre taking General Physics I?

The directory says it‚Äôs mandatory to sign up for a recitation section (obvs) but doesn‚Äôt say the lab is required. Physics I is a major requirement for me but it says nothing about physics lab.

Is it like chem lab where you don‚Äôt HAVE to take it if you‚Äôre taking gen chem?

thanks!!!

Basically the title. I‚Äôm an incoming freshman I‚Äôve decided that I definitely want a single but trying to choose between Furnald or John Jay is giving my such a headache, especially now that the housing application is open and I want to get it done as early as possible. I don‚Äôt see a difference between the two in terms of accommodation (like the AC sounds nice in Furnald but is it worth giving up the single-use bathrooms in JJ?). Can someone give their own experience?

Also, for future reference, what are the point of instructor managed waitlists like this?

Personal Expenses Grant and Work Study!?!
Hey guys! I was admitted to Columbia and as I was reviewing my financial aid package, I noticed that my entire cost of attendance was covered by Columbia's aid package, including $2262 for personal expenses and I was curious as to how this grant works. Is it given to me as a pocket money during my stay at Columbia? I was specifically curious about this because I was having doubts about getting any money at all for personal expenses  from my parents. Does this mean it is possible for me to come to the US with just a few hundred bucks?

Another question I had was that work study is not included in my financial aid package as my cost of attendance is covered by the Kluge scholarship and an additional $4k for my health insurance. Does this mean I am not obliged to work on campus?

Columbia Graduate Residential Housing
I'm researching housing options for Fall 2021. I will be moving to NYC with my boyfriend and we're looking to find a reasonably priced one bedroom apartment. I'm considering housing through Columbia and have a housing selection appointment later this week. 

1. What are people's experiences finding housing through Columbia versus NYC brokers? 
2. For those of you who have lived or currently live in Columbia housing, how would you describe your relationship with management? 
3. As for pricing, is it typically more expensive or cheaper to live in Columbia housing?
4. Is there anything you wished you had known prior to moving into Columbia housing, which I should know before committing to a lease?

Thank you in advance for any and all help!

Columbia Financial Aid
Hello everyone, 

I was recently just admitted into the class of 2025 and was ecstatic about the decision until I received my financial aid offer, or rather lack thereof. Columbia says on their website they are willing to negotiate but has anyone actually gone through that process and if so, did the university lower its cost of admissions? To add to this, my FAFSA is not reflective of my family's financial status as my mother got let go due to the pandemic.

Grad CS Student - Last class to take to go out with a bang?
So far, I've taken:

Intro to databases (for that system req)

AI

Causal Inference

Deep Learning & Adv Deep Learning

I'm part time so spread the above out over 2 years, Fall is my last semester and I HAVE to take Analysis of Algos which leaves me with just one left.

Does anyone have suggestions? I was eyeing reinforcement learning, contemplating Verma's unsupervised learning to ruin the 4.0+ GPA 

Is there any \*must take\* grad class that I somehow missed?

Hi everyone! I was recently admitted to the class of 2025, and I am beyond excited about Columbia. However, no one from my high school has gone in years, so I‚Äôm finding it hard to get a more personal account of the school experience. 

Consequently, I‚Äôd love to hear what you all have enjoyed about your time at Columbia. Anything/everything from favorite professors to restaurants to anecdotes would be greatly appreciated. 

Oh also, I‚Äôm planning to head up to NYC just to get a feel for campus. Any recommendations for what I should see/do on campus?

Thank you so much!

I applied as a Political Science major, so I am wondering if there is a mistake since the heading states the Engineering and Applied Science school....or does everyones' rejection letter say that?

Graduate Student Life Balance
Hey there!

How's the graduate student life for an MSIE student Columbia? If you want to finish your degree and only take courses during the Fall and Spring semesters, how many courses do you take? (Assuming that you can complete your MSIE degree in 2 years/4 semesters )

Are you literarily living and breathing in the library, studying when lectures are done because the workload each semester is a lot? Or do you have enough time to get involved with other organizations on campus and while having some time to do your own life things/enjoyments?

I am scared and just want to mentally prepare myself :')

I have a 3.1 W and a 25 ACT right now and I'm a Senior in highschool. Obviously I'm not counting out the school that I've been accepted to, just toying around with the idea of transferring. I've heard that Columbia puts a preference on Sophomore transfers cause of their Core Curriculum. Only problem is that even if I were to get a 4.0 at my state school it still wouldn't suffice cause they'd be looking at my HS transcript. So yeah, let me know, because I'm confused and I really would like to attend Columbia.

Advice on finding housing around Columbia
Hi all,

Unfortunately for the next academic year I am not guaranteed housing on Columbia's campus, but I was hoping that I might be able to find a place to stay that isn't super far away so that I can feel involved in the community and don't have to travel too far to classes. I have very little idea how people go about finding housing off-campus, and was wondering if there are any buildings nearby that are known for housing Columbia (especially undergrad) students? It does seem like anything close to campus is quite expensive, but I imagine that if I was living far away I would feel very isolated. Any suggestions or recommendations would be much appreciated.

SSOL unable to add classes? Waitlist only?
Hi all,

I'm coming back to Columbia after an academic leave, so I don't know if registration has changed because of the pandemic, but I'm unable to actually add classes on SSOL (I can only add myself to waitlists). In particular, I'm trying to register for upper-level CS classes, for which I'm only getting the waitlist option. Is anyone else experiencing this? It's frustrating because I can only add myself to 3 waitlists max and obviously I'm trying to take more than 3 classes. I'm writing to my advisor now, but I also wanted to check here.

As a result, I've never been tested at Columbia, or done any of the other stuff required by the app (which I've never opened before just now). Will it be possible for me to go get the shot, or should I jsut cancel and try to find somewhere else?

P/D/F Option Not Available
Is anyone else‚Äôs SSOL not allowing them to P/D/F any of their classes? I thought we were allowed to do any 1 class just like last semester. Has anyone else not been able to do that? Thanks !

Easy and interesting Econ electives?
Just a burnt-out Econ major looking for easy but interesting 3000-level+ electives to take in the fall. Non-technical is best!

should i apply to GS?
i missed the application window for transfer and I'm now considering applying to GS. I've read a lot online about student's experiences and its usually pretty mixed, some feel included by others and some don't. i'm pretty outgoing so i'm not too worried about this. i'm sure I'd be able to make friends if i just put in a lot of effort.

for context, I'm  17 so I'm not the typical GS-er either, I graduated high school pretty early, already attended college, and have a unique story that disqualifies me for first-year consideration.  GS sounds pretty ideal on surface-level; I get to go to a reputable school while having a flexible schedule for work and to pursue my extracurriculars. however, two small things hold me back from applying

1. no access to CC/SEAS dorms. i have no problem having to live off campus but not even being able to access the dorms for events is kind of off-putting. Like I said, I'm 17, so i'd inevitably gravitate towards CC/SEAS students and would likely want to hang out in their dorms / lounge rooms for parties, studying, etc. I just cringe at the idea of having to ask someone to let me in every time. also I heard some school events are held specifically in CC/SEAS housing and even worse, some are marked specifically for CC/SEAS students :/
2. not as important but alumni kids apparently aren't considered legacies of Columbia. this makes no sense to me. if GS-ers take the exact same classes and earn the same degrees, why are their kids treated differently from CC/SEAS/Barnard kids? i don't know this just kind of rubs me the wrong way, it feels like a purposeful attempt to reinforce the idea that they're not actually as valued as the other students. i really hope i'm wrong though.

that's basically it. right now i'm pretty in the middle, I love the idea of Columbia but I was also offered admission into a similarly ranked school (uchicago) so I don't know if its even worth applying to columbia. i would love from input from anyone that has attended GS, but any insight is appreciated!

CS Minor as an Engineering Major?
So I'm currently a first year in SEAS (2024) heavily considering to major in BME.  I've taken a look at the degree track and it looks like I'm almost a semester ahead in the track (due to the Chem track I took last semester as well as the whole 40-credit, tuition-free summer thing this year).  In an attempt to fill my schedule productively and also have some inkling of enjoyment, I was considering minoring in computer science.  

Here's the catch: I don't have prior experience with CS before coming to Columbia.  I took intro to python last semester and really did enjoy it.  It also seems like CS is just a good skill to have in general (especially as a stem major), and I feel like it might help me in the job field.  Nothing trumps experience in the field, of course, but I'm willing to fine-tune my computer skills if it'll make me a more attractive candidate.

I ended up with a B+ in intro to python last semester, so I'm not sure what that says about my abilities blindly coming into the CS field.  It doesn't look like I'll need to overdo my schedule too much to accommodate additional CS courses, and I think some of them \*may\* count for my nontech electives later on.  So I'm just wondering how plausible this plan is.  I've talked to multiple people with minimal to zero experience in the CS field who intend to major in CS, but I feel like having a separate major with no prior background in CS and an intended CS minor is a different animal.  I'm definitely willing to work (I say that now) to understand the material.  Is there anyone who's been in a similar situation or anyone who just has general advice/feedback on whether or not this is a good idea?

Columbia MSCS vs. Stanford MSCS part-time remote
Hey CS guys and girls!

I graduated CC last spring and I‚Äôm going back to school for my CS master‚Äôs in the fall. I‚Äôm deciding between MS Express at Columbia and Stanford‚Äôs MSCS. The complication is that I don‚Äôt want to relocate to the west coast - so my option for Stanford is to do it part-time remotely while working full-time (they have a program for working professionals called HCP, you can‚Äôt just do full-time remote).

Columbia I‚Äôd finish in 1.5, maybe 2 years as a full-time student. Stanford I‚Äôd finish in about 3 years as a part-time student, and I‚Äôd have to do it while working.

What to do?

Edit: my goal is to get a kickass CS education and a good SWE job at a unicorn or quant firm.

Why aren't the Professors listed in the Course Directory?
I'm looking at the LitHum directory and no professors are listed. All I can see is the days and times that the class is being taught. Is there a way I can see who is teaching what without waiting till classes start and the university decides to fill that portion of the Course Directory??
